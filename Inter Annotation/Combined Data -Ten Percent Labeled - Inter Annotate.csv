There was a lot about the background on Lewis Carroll and how Alice had came to life over the years in different countries. There were good opportunities for photos and lots on for young and old alike.Future meets Science - the exhibition gets the public involved with digital integration. However it is fairly crazy in parts with people standing and not moving or moving slowly on walls. Everyone eventually gets a turn at the main areas. The lights are very pretty and can leave you in awe.Floatopia - this has been put on the top floor and it's a blimp full of joy with giant inflations taking up space and you'd want to run up and cuddle it but you will be asked to step back from the artwork to a marked point for photos.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/fe/1a/21/helen-w.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r707415511-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html,0.781,Positive,171,useful,useful,useful,3,,,

Gardens by the Bay,Bryce M,Make time to spend outside the gardens! Beautiful view and confusing walk,40,15-Apr-20,"We should have looked more into how much there was to do for free before going into the bigger portions of the gardens! It was really cool to see as much as we did with as little time as we had, as well as the extra burden of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, due to the pandemic, there was literally no line to get into the SuperTree and both Conservatories. The conservatories were very pretty to walk through. We then went to the Super Tree (which was less than we thought because there is a walkway as well, that is not the ""Super Tree"") and watched the sunset. The experience was perfect for what we had time for, however my wife and I both agreed that it would have been better to allot more time to walk through the gardens being there is so much more to see than the two conservatories and the super tree. We looked on trip-advisor and other reviews of the gardens and were told that 4 hours would be enough time to walk through the entirety of the park. IT IS NOT! There is so much more to see and walk through, and we were there beyond the closing of the park.Finding the openings to the Conservatories and Super Tree from Marina bay sands was a pain! We walked for probably around 30 minutes before we were able to find an entrance to the park (In this area, there is no crosswalks, and all intersections for walking transit go underground or above the road), we followed the signs, and tried multiple different ways, and even talked to information desks and got no help to get there.Long story short, if you're trying to schedule out times, only go to the paid portions and take the loss of the rest of the park, and get a ride so you're not looking more for crosswalks than plants and sights.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1b/42/88/69/bryceamill.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r752641762-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html,0.9556,Positive,320,useful,useful,useful,3,,,

Jurong Bird Park,rashig,A good half day outing,40,4-Jun-17,"No matter how much you plan and read the map before you go, you do get confused in these parks. My advice would be to make it for the two morning shows - 10.00 & 11.00 am.Do the tram ride post that. We ended up reaching at 10.30 and immediately followed the herd to stand in the tram line, which was long at that point. Ended up missing the 11 am show also and had to wait all the way till 3 pm for the High Flyers. Had no energy to wait to see the next show at 4 pm. So go early, catch the shows first, and then you are free to wander around. The park is not too big, and can easily be covered in a half day. I found the souvenirs here reasonably priced compared to other tourist attractions. One word of caution - if you feed the lories at Lory Loft, be sure your child is wearing sleeves. The bird are a little heavy and flock down on the person holding the nectar. My daughter got a big scratch on her shoulder. May be an interesting experience, but not my idea of fun.

The food was very overpriced, although it did come with a souvenir cup. The park itself was large, and had a few hills. For someone like me who has physical illnesses, I found it difficult in the heat. I did see transportation go past in the grounds, but I couldn't see any signage around as to what it was or the cost if any. I did however see the bird park had wheelchairs and prams for rent which was great. As for the birds, 8 felt a bit sorry for them. Their enclosures seem to have everything they need in there, but some of them seemed a bit cramped. The bird show I saw was good, but it wasn't very interactive with the audience which was a shame, and it seemed that if you got there early and sat up front, then you were punished by not being one of the chosen few who got to interact with the birds. They did however offer free photos at the end, but tbh It felt as if you'd be giving them the rights to use your image by letting them take your photo, and so I sadly declined. Jurong bird park has the makings of a great place, and the staff were lovely for the most part.

Jurong Bird Park,andrewgraham52,BELOW AVERAGE,20,28-Jan-20,"More geared as a children's theme parkThis is my THIRD visit to Jurong Bird Park, over 18 years and I have watched it's slow decline, today I was unimpressed and appauled at some of the psittacines genera enclosures. Some enclosures I felt had too many birds for the size of the enclosure, such as the Lears Macaw with one Macaw having no feathers on its head, was it sick or being plucked by others ? All the same it wasn't a good look. Some psittacine enclosures just had bare minimum of natural enrichment activities, just branches as perches and ropes. The Spix Macaw flight enclosure was what I had expected, many leafed branches, trees and branches, however neither Spix Macaw was visiable and I wondered if they were still actually housed at Jurong anymore, it was a real disappointment not see this magnificent Macaw.There appears to be a significant decline in the actual numbers of psittacine species now housed at the Park, as very few Amazons as to past years, no Quakers, and 4 Caiques amongst others.Many of the parrot enclosures all the birds were clinging to the wire high at the back of their enclosure, obviously not content to perch on the few branches in each enclosure so this was a sad sight.The free flight bird shows, are still highly entertaining, and I applaude the lectures to the crowd on the responsibilities of caring for a parrot and the importance of parrot conservation, the show is a good educational lesson for all.Many people delight in having their picture taken with a Macaw or a large species parrot, but enquiring this is no longer possible, only to be told you can hold a T bar with conures , even thou the designated area for picture opportunity had macaws and cockatoos perched on stands.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r741656447-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html,0.7365,Positive,303,useful,useful,useful,3,,,

SGD$25 for 1 photo.Me: We will not buy it.Your staff: LAST CHANCE. SGD$20 for 1 PHOTO.We then walked away. Quoting an outrageous price SGD $50 for 1 photo?Discount offered? That means the price quoted is not fixed and you can bargain with the price?Is it a park owned business or privately operated business at Jurong Bird Park?Such method of price quotation really deter tourists from having enjoyable moments at the park.2. Poor staff training and miscommunication among staffBefore I made my visit to Jurong Bird Park, I have asked the staff whether it is possible to redeem the Lunch with Parrots with the iVenture cards. The reply I received is positive and clearly stating that I can redeem at the restaurants. However, the staff at the restaurant have no idea what I am talking about when I made the visit.

Please don't forget to care for the well being of the birds that are caged first, protecting them from physical interaction from visitors second.If you want visitors to stay away from the birds. Please place them in the waterfall section don't caged them to see.

Jurong Bird Park,David B,Frustrating day.,20,4-Jun-15,We had been told by friends that the Jurong Bird Park was an excellent place to visit so we were looking forward to it. Maybe we have been spoiled by the Singapore Zoo and we also had my sister there who is from St. Louis with another excellent Zoo but although the variety is great and you could spend a lot of time there we found our time frustrating. Why?First it is not easy to get to or leave. It is quite far from any MRT/train station so you need to take the taxi if you are older and can't walk as far as you used to. Then when your ready to leave you either stand for an hour to get a taxi or call you. If you live in Singapore then great you have a phone but I saw some folks with small children begging to borrow a phone to call a taxi which they finally got help from someone.Second the phamplets and signs at the park are a joke and confusing. We wanted to see the Flamingo feeding so we waited at the Flamingo lake and nothing happened then looked closer and it said Flamingo pool which was another place.Third the cages of many of the birds were so dark and dense mesh it was hard to see the birds or get good pictures.There were highlights of couse and i am sure the shows were good but we missed to timing. The Lorry section was great.All in all a disappointing day. I hear they are going to combine the Bird park with the Zoo and I think that will really up the attraction. So I would suggest visitng other attractions in Singapore if you have limited time. That is unless you are an avid bird watcher.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/6e/11/51/david-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r277627853-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html,0.9838,Positive,298,useful,useful,useful,3,,,

We walked over the Glass Passage connecting the two parts of the museum.The free exhibits included large rooms on the history of Singapore, including one devoted to the Japanese occupation. It is interesting reading some of the comments here by Japanese tourists. They generally do not know much about it at all. NMS has a mandate to explain the recent history of the country and it does that well.Some of the exhibits on other aspects are underwhelming. We did not, on that basis, pay for tickets to the other parts of the museum. However, the original Victorian building is a gem!

Yes it can be very dark and scary but there are park personnel at some places to help you. You will get adrenaline rushes from time to time. For me, it was when I realised the spotted hyena was too close for comfort. But there were nice surprises like I saw a little bat sucking on banana juice strategically placed along a path on the fishing cat trail. Unfortunately it's very shy and will fly off when more people come.I caught tram no. 1 at 8:45pm. By then, there was no longer a queue.

Night Safari,MRS616,Really worth doing - don't believe the critics,40,26-Aug-19,"I had a very limited time schedule in singapore and after reading reviews here I almost didn't do this because there were so many negatives. However friends who live in singapore told us it was a must see and gave us tips on missing the crowds. It was really worth doing but I think it is worth reading the following tips:Tips:1. It takes a long time to get here on public transport (this Is surprisingly information that isn't emphasised anywhere I found). If you are planning to do the MRT to ang mo kio and then the bus there, it does go straight to the doors but the bus ride is quite long (and it's a public bus so it stops multiple times on the way). It takes around 35-40 minutes on the bus (in light traffic) so be aware of this and factor an hour total travel time if doing the above. I personally would just take a taxi if I went next time (a 'grab'¬ù taxi from the city will cost around 18-20 dollars). We took a standard taxi home (to novena area) and it cost around 35 bucks, grab is much cheaper (Uber equivalent in singapore which is pretty good).2. GO LATER (perhaps aim to arrive between 2000-2100, go watch sunset first somewhere else) and aim to do the tram ride later when most people have gone. We had this advice from friends and basically we took the last tram ride (2215) and the queue was minimal (maybe 10 minutes). Friends have said definitely don't queue up for the tram rides before 2100 as it is packed (note queuing is the cause of most of the negative reviews).3. If you decide to go a bit earlier than 2100 then do all the walking trails FIRST and then the tram ride later. There are a lot of great animals you won't see on the tram at all, and you will see much closer up and have time to appreciate including tigers and leopards. Also on the tram there are animals that you don't see but then I ended up seeing on the walking tracks (eg. I saw the lions and the leopard which I missed on the tram). Factor around an hour at least to do the walking tracks at pace, more if you want to dawdle and read all the info etc. I think it's actually more enjoyable than the tram....4. The tram ride is not that enjoyable, as it is ruined by Chinese tourists talking loudly and incessantly so you can barely hear the commentary. Also the commentary is a real Disney style pre-recorded blurb, it's sad they don't choose to have the driver do a live commentary. There are a few (not that many) areas that you won't get to see on walking tracks though, so it is still worth doing.So in conclusion it's a really good experience and you see some great animals - just take my advice and- arrive later- do walking tracks first and tram after to avoid huge queues for tram- factor at least 2 hours for the whole visit- factor in an hour to get there if using public transport (I would take a grab taxi!)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r673717013-Night_Safari-Singapore.html,0.9851,Positive,536,useful,useful,useful,3,,,

To be honest although the views are stunning we found it all pretty disappointing.

The drinks took ages to come and the snacks didn't appear. We had finished our drinks and were trying to pay (we gave up on the snacks) and they almost insisted we stay and wait for the snacks ! We needed to leave and they eventually 'boxed' the snacks which took more time and we had an appointment and we just binned the box anyway.

A MUST DO.,50,24-Feb-19,During our stay in Singapore we went on the Cable Car which took us to Mount Faber and especially Santosa Island.We purchased the $55 dollar special deal. This gave us unlimited rides and entry to two Attractions. In the cable car you had the best views of this area you would want to see.Just breathtaking views and overall a photographers delight. I know i took over 100 photos and some videos.There is even a massive waterpak as one of the attractions.There are far too many to list.We went to the Butterfly Exhibit and this was wonderful. Highly Recommended. They even have bugs from giant rhino bugs right down to deadly spiders alive and on display. The scorpions made me look twice. All sizes and shapes.The second exhibit was the Massive Merlion. A three minute video on his history than in and up you go in the lift to the 10th floor gives you access to the lookout on his head and the lookout in his mouth. Stunning views and photo opportunities from both lookouts.This is Highly Recommended.The entry tickets also allow you to ride the Mono Rail between different locations.Overall this RIDE IS A MUST DO AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r654478839-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html,0.9872,Positive,199,useful,useful,useful,3,,,

I have utilised the rediscover Singapore vouchers with Klook for my cable car ride. Klook has sent me 5 QR codes for 5 tickets bought. Upon entry to board the cable car, the staff claimed that there was issues with 2 of my QR code tickets. She then advised me to go to the ticketing counter to redeem the 2 QR code tickets which have issues. I then proceed to the ticketing counter as per her advice. However, the staffs at ticketing counter gave me a different advice. They requested that I have to pay for the two tickets which have issues. After which, I have to write in to Klook to request for a refund for the 2 tickets paid. I then asked the ticketing staffs for a better alternative to resolve my ticketing issues. I explained to them that it is unfair for consumers to pay for the tickets out of their own pockets and has to chase the refund from Klook due to the glitch by Klook. I tried patiently to reason with them. The staff then tried to call Klook for half an hour but in avail. I had to wait for them to resolve the issue. I wanted to speak to the manager but could only get him 15mins later. In the end, he did not provide a satisfactory solution to my problem and keep emphasing that the problem lies with Klook and not with One Faber Group. This is certainly a very unpleasant and bad customer service provided by One Faber Group. I feel that I was being penalised for some glitches in the travel app. Especially in consumers' views, they did not provide an amicable solution to the issues which were not caused by consumers.

The staff manning the lines of people getting on or off the flyer looked bored. It was just 5 of us in our pod. While I do admit that the view is quite pretty, it wasn't so stunning that you needed to pay $33 for it. There are many other ways to enjoy the view, like roof top bars or skyscrapers/skyrise buildings nearby. The entire 30 minute ride was slow and boring. Initially, we were contemplating on buying the Premium Champagne Flight tickets '¬ì luckily we changed our minds at the last minute. That would have been a complete waste of $69.

Upon which I was given the option to reschedule my visit or wait in the queue.Considering it was now 8pm, the onsite manager did not seem to be concerned about the potential 10pm boarding time or the 1 hour queue which was following me. They had not been informed of the prospect of not being able to board the Singapore flyer within the advertised operating hours.I am appalled by this general disregard for the paying public and would hope the SF revise their operating procedures.In all fairness, upon request I have been promised a full refund, and I do plan to rebook in the future, but being conscious of and taking into account the poor operating procedures. I will allow 3 hours queuing time. With the hope of having an enjoyable experience at what could be a world leading attraction.It's just a shame that the customer experience focus has been lost.....maybe this is due to COVID-19, or maybe not? I will leave you to form your own opinion should you wish to visit the SF.Make sure you plan on a 3 hour queue and don't believe the the online time slots!

You do need an EZ-Link card though (1 per person, so a little inconvenient) but considering you only pay 5 bucks for a view (and you get to stay as long as you like and sit and stand if you so wish) the Singapore flyer is truly a rip-off.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/40/9f/71/nerissa-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r193310944-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html,0.9395,Positive,160,useful,useful,useful,3,,,
Singapore Flyer,mfiore10,Nightmare Ride Ended Up In Hospital (and costing me $200+) & If you are scared of heights. Don't do it!,10,11-Jan-13,My experience was single-handedly one of the most traumatic I've had while travelling. It was my last night in Singapore I had an accident at the building of the flyer. The proprietor of the cafe did not offer any assistance as I had hurt myself but after telling the staff on the flyer what had happened I managed (with persistence) to get a manager to talk to. In fact she sniffed her nose at me and continued talking (I did not enjoy the Singaporean customer service).I ended up being wheeled off the flyer in a wheelchair and slugged $200 for the most expensive hospital in Singapore (closest in the area) and then slugged again another $20 (ish) dollars for the taxi to get back to my hotel.This ruined the next part of my trip.Unfortunately there is not much that can be done to get my money back because the Singapore consumer affairs won't touch the matter and the Flyer have washed their hands clean of the matter but that is another issue not for this review...all I would say is don't get hurt on it!Putting aside my personal experiencePROSI had a private cabin with drinks.The Singapore Slinger is nice - but if you are scared of heights dutch courage is not going to help.Reaction time of the staff members.CONSThis is in the title. If you are scared of heights. Do not ride the wheel. I spent my night in pain and bawling my eyes out because I was terrified of the ride and the horrible experience. Not exactly the romantic night I planned eh?The view seems to be blocked by buildings - from the photos I've seen since I was too frightened to look around.Having to literally jump onto the flyer but yet was wheeled out afterwards.I am really glad I didn't pay for the dinner.

We fell in love with the Singapore Zoo all over again, after decades since either of us step foot inside! We long to show some love to the animals there after the months of closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When this iconic attraction finally reopened, we signed up for the limited slots available on a Sunday. To our pleasant surprise, there were no crowds despite it being a weekend. The zoo has done a great job in terms of safe distancing: staggered limited entries, shows limited strictly to 50 pax (with ample separation between groups), and ambassadors around at popular exhibits to ensure there is no overcrowding. Not all the exhibits were open, for example Frozen Tundra was closed, I assume due to it being an enclosed space. However, we enjoyed the vast majority of exhibits that were open. We especially loved that the animals had ample space to roam around. We were so amused by the friendly monkeys and beautiful butterflies that came really up close to us too! This zoo is very kid-friendly too, so we saw lots of families. Just be prepared to spend several hours there to cover all the exhibits; there can be a lot of walking involved but at least the tree cover provided good shade.

I must admit that it's quite systematic and organised and it scores high on the overall presentation but I failed to see a lot many animals and a few of them looked poorly nourished. Though this could be a subjective statement but I have seen zoos with better well kept animals. On all the other aspects the zoo scores full marks. The shows were not very interesting and the one I really liked was the splash safari. Rest are just okay. You need to walk a lot in the zoo premises so I suggest that you buy the ticket inclusive of trams. Keep yourself well hydrated as you stroll around the zoo since it's quite hot most of the days. You have plenty of water stations to fill your water bottles. Take a zoo map along with you so you can organise yourself better off and be able to watch all the shows. Food in the zoo premises is decent and a meal for two could be wrapped between 20-25 SGD.

We made the mistake of going back for the 8:45 p.m. 'light show', which was a massive disappointment. For barely 15 minutes, a light is projected on to the trunks of the Supertrees, making colours appear but not in a particularly interesting way. For some reason we assumed the skeletal 'branches' of the Supertrees would light up or there would be laser beams or something, but it's all very dull. What's worse, the venue was very crowded with thousands of other punters, many of whom (like us) cried out in dismay when the 'show' ended (i.e. as if to say 'is that all?'). Then, when you fight you way back down to Bayfront MRT station, you will be forced to queue for MRT tickets unless you have a prepaid pass. It really isn't worth it.
