Singapore Botanic Gardens,Lau288,Scary Hltler-eque bouncer ruins visit,20,31-Dec-20,"Energised by an excellent Hertage tour delivered most competently by a very experienced guide, I decided to spend more time at SBG by heading to the Orchid section. and was abruptly halted by a Hitler-esque , bouncer like individual who demanded yet another check in . I m totally surprised as I had already done the necessary earlier with all details given and even have a sticker to announce tht official entry logistics has been done . Strange and illogical that the orchid garden ,sited clearly within the SBG behaves as it if its NOT part of the Garden .. There is no entrnce fee , so the staff at this entrance are clearly extranous and really shd be deployed elsewhere. The brutish bouncer character would be most suited for entrances where outside contractors need to be processed before they enter high security areas . Sadly , it has been only a year since the former director who had hailed fr Kew Gardens has retired and the grace and charm of some of the gardens personnel have already deteriorated .",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r780218590-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html

The write-ups were most informative and it was a delight to sight birds like plover, sunbird as well as catch glimpses of salamanders crawling along pathways and staircases.Meanwhile a profusion of bougainvillea, frangipani and other blooms delight your senses while kampong fowl make their way on the grasses,crowing occasionally.We had lunch at The Halia which is now halal with local dishes and international selections like pizza and salad but do make a reservation as space is limited with social distancing requirements now.The food is good though a trifle expensive and they sell bottled jam and sauces.The Orchid enclosure is open to seniors at $1 per pax and there is a small waterfall, spice garden and numerous benches for lounging as well as clean toilets and a water fountain at Cafe Verde.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r769664590-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html

Singapore Botanic Gardens,bruceee_carl,In the City Jungle,50,20-Aug-20,"I figured nothing could suit what I saw after I went to Singapore's Gardens By the Bay. Yet I realized that it was difficult to select one over the other when visiting the Singapore Botanic Gardens.

The entire region is available to those who give families such a blessing. It has just a ticked entrance to the Orchid Garden.The entrance has a magnificent clock tower, decorated in color and kind by tastefully picked orchid plants. There are small pergolas laden with orchids, small enclosures of delicious landscaped trees , rocks, swimming pools and cascades, from which the rich colors of the orchid rises and leave the beauty without expression. There's a popular garden with orchids named after famous men and women and an orchid displaying the famous botanists' orchid. You will appreciate your care to maintain the ""run"" of the floral orchid plants and the ""back-up"" fields awaiting their turn. The entire idea is something to be respected and I am grateful for seeing the natural glory!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1b/d1/1c/ef/culture46847428104.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r765915439-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html

Of course you have to scan the SafeEntry QR code when you enter the gardens.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,Grover R,The Heart of Singapore - MUST SEE - World's Best,50,10-Apr-20,"It took me a while to think of what is Singapore's signature and not until I returned did the answer come, Gardens and Botany. Raffels knew it when he created the first botanical garden as he first set up the city. On Tripadvisor, 5 of the top 10 attractions are gardens.This is the most historic and traditional of those gardens. However, this is not one garden but rather a series of gardens that would be the rival of any community on their own. Their is an orchid garden, ginger garden, healing garden, children's garden, bonzai garden, palm valley, rain forest and several of the most beautiful lakes.My wife and I had a couple of hours on the morning of my 50th birthday and this was the perfect place to spend it. We took a cab to the main entrance off Orchard. We then meandered our way through the various gardens to the complete other end where you can catch the rapid transit. This is the best way to see it all but the healing garden as we went on a Tuesday when that garden is closed. I was simply blown away as I had never seen a garden so diverse and yet so complete as this. I know my tripadvisor profile says I have only seen 13% of the world but this is World's Best.I don't care if you say gardens and botany are not your thing. If you come all the way to Singapore, you can not skip something this World Class when you are there. For Singapore, this is an absolute MUST SEE. The best part is you can see all of this for free (except the Orchids, small price).

The entire area is open to access by all which is such a blessing for families. Only the Orchid Garden has a ticketed entrance.The entrance has a spectacular clock tower covered all over by tastefully selected orchid plants, matched and contrasted in colour and kind. There are little pergolas laden with hanging orchids, small enclosures with tastefully landscaped trees, rocks, pools, and waterfalls, from which the richness of orchid colours burst forth, leaving one speechless at their beauty. There is a celebrity garden featuring orchids named after famous men and women, and another which displays the orchids created by famous botanists. One can appreciate the meticulous care taken to maintain the ""display"" and the ""back up"" fields of flowering orchid plants awaiting their turn.

We entered from the north at the 'Botanic Gardens Station' bus stop. There are free, detailed maps to use available here.There is a huge array of flowers and wildlife, like the lake in the northern section which housed black swans and turtles. We also visited the Orchid Gardens which is a paid attraction, however we got in free with student cards (I'm not sure how as I thought there was still a charge for students). This was also enjoyable and at least worth a couple of SGD to see. We left the gardens via the south gate to 'Singapore Botanic Gardens' bus stop.In summary, the variety of plants and the information available makes this attraction stand out, and makes it worthy of recommendation.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/19/e8/22/a9/mr-travels1920.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r731901740-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html

From the cafe serving a life saving lime drink or appetising pizza to full blown restaurants. The choice is yours. You'll need at least a couple of hours. Taxis are very reasonable and on leaving go to the taxi rank, ring the bell on the board and a passing taxi will see the lit sign on the main road and come to your aid.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,Sandra B,Pleasant looks in humid climate,40,20-Oct-19,"We spent a nice afternoon walking around the Botanic gardens, which are extremely huge and have a variety of mini gardens on offer to look at. Whilst you have to pay to get into the special Orchid Garden, the main Botanic Garden is free for all.Visitors may want to see if there will be any performance on stage in the middle of the Garden, as it is a great atmosphere and worthwhile to stay. We had the pleasure to listen to Singapore Uni's orchestra perform free of charge for us.The only downside is that additionally to the humid and hot climate of Singapore, the trees and the mini lakes add an extra humidity to the air, which makes it quite exhausting to walk around. Have plenty of water with you - but don't worry there's plenty of shops located inside should you run out. It's also easy to find, as it is directly outside the station 'Botanical Gardens'.The only thing that I would have wished for was a bit more colours and ease to find your way, but maybe that's just me :)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r730599619-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html

It's not the most spectacular gardens I've visited but we saw some wildlife including a few large monitor lizards and lots of butterflies. Our primary aim was the Orchid Garden, so we didn't deviate far off the main path there.The Orchid Gardens however are amazing and well worth the effort.

Nothing. If you arrive by MRT Botanic Garden it is nearly a mile to the orchids and not that much shorter from MRT Napier.

They simply just walk around and are super friendly. Ponds and lakes had massive numbers of turtles and otter sightings were common for us. But when it came to the gardens I was expecting more. Don't get me wrong, the gardens were lush and green and super enjoyable to walk around through but there weren't many flowers and plants with more interesting features. There were heaps of facilities like grass areas, gazebos, cute undercover house type things, toilets, a restaurant and a kids section but something was missing. The kids area (that we did wander around in) made me feel like kids wouldn't enjoy it. I mean, there's a playground and fun little ponds but I can't imagine kids being interested in anything but those few facilities.

For avid Yoga or TRX practitioner, you have few concrete gazebo overlooking beautiful scenery for you to do these activities.The only dampener, is after sunset, this whole garden is quite poorly lit and the signage in and out of the garden can be confusing.I'm giving 3 star, because they have a beautiful small pond at the edge of this garden but quite poorly maintained.

I m totally surprised as I had already done the necessary earlier with all details given and even have a sticker to announce tht official entry logistics has been done . Strange and illogical that the orchid garden ,sited clearly within the SBG behaves as it if its NOT part of the Garden .. There is no entrnce fee , so the staff at this entrance are clearly extranous and really shd be deployed elsewhere. The brutish bouncer character would be most suited for entrances where outside contractors need to be processed before they enter high security areas .

If you proud of your garden, it should be taken full of care by locals...Still, lot of lawn spaces so it can be good place to gather big groups and do some picnic.

You can find shade her and there by the threes but still you will sweat a lot if you want to see the whole gardens.There are a few small ponds you can look at and some birds and even some statues to see but nothing special. Locals use this garden as a picnic place but to my taste (and my 1 year 2 months old kids taste) it was too much. In the restaurants also no air conditioning.

I suppose if you've never been to a botanic garden before, you might be remotely impressed but I found it to be a waste of time and energy.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/8d/1e/5e/facebook-avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r509211599-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html
Singapore Botanic Gardens,Mero61,Sad to see,20,17-Mar-14,"A dry February has resulted in the gardens being decimated.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,Hope K,Botanic Gardens: No Peace,20,25-Feb-14,"I took a solo trip to the botanic gardens early on a Saturday morning. I arrived at 8am via bus from my apartment, ready to explore, get some exercise, and rest the mind.I entered to park to find screaming children on scooters, a family with a crying toddler that somehow managed to follow me (despite a quick pace) to, and around the rain forest trail, followed by an extremely rude local who i saw yelling at a random man to ""get out of his [insert expletive] country."" I captured the man on video and ended up having to share it with security.I want to give this place the benefit of the doubt but i really cannot. Entertaining sure? But not in the way I had hoped. Unless there is some secluded garden I'm unaware of, save yourself the frustration.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/ea/38/df/kittermh.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r461528439-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html

Singapore Botanic Gardens,Nina L,Odd person's review,20,30-Jul-13,"Reading all the reviews that have been written before me, I wonder if there is something wrong with me!On a rare day off, I walked around the Gardens, which seemed rather sterile and bland. Yes there were the usual trees/ lakes/ lawns but maybe I am bespoiled by trees that are 150 years old or more in Ootacamund India, or the Cycas that was planted in the late 1770's at the Kew in London!It had no character and was utterly devoid of charm.But, yes, it is green, it is free and since there are only a handful of attractions in Singapore, this becomes one that you have to add to the list!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/ec/4e/71/ninakanth.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r394894115-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html

Singapore Botanic Gardens,Ricky W,"Ok, but no highlight",20,24-May-13,"We went here because of the high rating it has on tripadvisor. Although it seemed a place the locals enjoyed for walking dogs and going for a run in with good paths and a lot of greenery, if you only have a limited time in Singapore I wouldn't recommend this as there wasn't much to see for the amount of effort in the heat",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r332430719-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html
Singapore Botanic Gardens,ChristchurchMintyone,HOW did this place get ranked so high?,20,8-Apr-13,"Seriously, the only reason you'd be amazed by this place is if you'd lived in a concrete jungle your whole life and never seen grass.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,need_2_go_soon,Tacky and underwhelming,20,18-Feb-13,"There has been a lot of money spent in the gardens and enclosed hot houses. If you are a local there is a cheaper price which makes tourists feel like second class citizens. We paid the money to go into the two covered gardens, it was not worth it. It is obvious that the whole garden is still in the early stages of growth with lots of Garden bed and infrastructure still showing through. If you are a local with kids go for a look if you are a tourist come back in a couple of years when the plants are established.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r290916084-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html

Singapore Botanic Gardens,Darwan T,nothing new,20,18-Feb-12,nothing was improved since 1998. it is sad to say. but it is actually a very nice place to hang out with family.

Singapore Botanic Gardens,balloonexpert,Unsuitable for wheelchairs,10,16-Apr-19,"These gardens are beautiful but if you are pushing a wheelchair and want to visit the orchid garden, just forget it.We followed the disabled signs painted on the ground and they led to steep stairs every time! I was so upset because we had to get my son out of his chair and get him down the stairs, and then come back for the chair. It was a nightmare. This happened 3 times with 3 different signs.Also, there is a reduced fee for pensioners, for which I am grateful, but nothing for disabled people. This was also disappointing.Somebody needs to sort out those signs so that no one else has the same problem that we had today.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/84/7d/c9/balloonexpert.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r248187407-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html

Singapore Botanic Gardens,Tim S,Peaceful Oasis in the Middle of Singapore,10,11-Mar-19,"Whether you are visiting Singapore or you live here, the Botanic Gardens are not to be missed. The gardens are a perfectly manicured masterpiece of tropical plants, trees and flowers. They have meandering paths throughout the gardens and plenty of shade to stay cool on a hot summer day. Though I haven't been yet, apparently the Orchid Garden is well worth seeing. We went with some friends and their kids to the SPH Walk of Giants and were pleasantly surprised by this fun little 'playground' for kids and adults. We've also done a lot of running around the gardens and love taking all of the meandering paths. Take a morning or afternoon and just wander around the park and then end up at the Botanic Gardens MRT Station where you can find some cool restaurants to quench your thirst and rest your weary legs.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/cd/2c/b9/tim-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r225276946-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html
Singapore Botanic Gardens,Michael B,Pleasant but KEEP OFF THE GRASS,10,8-Jan-19,"Heard so much about it that the family decided to go for a picnic in a week day. The kids, 14 & 9 started playing badminton for fun on the grass with a shuttlecock and rackets (no net) and nobody around. We could see old pensioners spying on them (apparently there are lots of them in the park working as spy's to report to the park security force). Sure enough a buggy of park state troopers arrived and told us to get off the grass as playing was not allowed. Back's up Singapore as being a ""no"" land: no playing, no going on the grass, no having fun.Kinds of defeats part of the object of going to the park!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r212621624-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html
Singapore Botanic Gardens,twinkletwinkle,"5 Star Garden, 1 Star for...",10,23-Sep-18,"Firstly we are locals and this is one of our favourite places to relax and wander around in Singapore. Definitely recommend a visit, especially in the evenings when it's cooler. Nature never disappoints, it's usually the few humans in it that do.We were there at around 10pm - 1030pm one evening. We came across a wide wooden foot bridge across a little pond. We decided to lie down, at the edge of the bridge to enjoy the moonlight.Only about 7 people passed us whilst we were there for about an hour and a half.Firstly, we would like to point out that this bridge is more than wide enough for one to two 4-seater golf carts to drive through.2 staff members drives up in their cart, telling us that we were not allowed to lie down on that bridge. We were completely dumb-founded.It was near the middle of the night, there was no one about by then, we were not blocking anyone, we were not yelling loudly, we were not fishing, just 2 friends, (fully dressed by the way) lying quietly enjoying the nite. Frankly speaking, we do not see what the problem was. We were not causing any inconvenience to anyone, or any plant at the moment.For a place that is suppose to offer relaxation and calm, it is far from that in this instance. Very sad that this type of blinkered attutude and lack of discretion as to when to enforce ""Rules and Reguations"" appropriately is not taken into consideration.But of course, we are in a society that bans the sale of Rum and Raisin ice-cream after 1030pm just because there is an alcohol ban in general. What more can we expect?Other than that, great garden ~ relax and enjoy if you can but you better check where you can or cannot lie down, whilst you are at it, maybe even check on where you are allowed to stand or sit.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310900-r208122104-Singapore_Botanic_Gardens-Singapore.html
