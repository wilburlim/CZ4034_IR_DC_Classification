Jurong Bird Park,leecD7494SE,Brings back memories,50,1-Feb-21,"A nostalgic trip back to the bird park to experience it before they shifts to Mandai. Jurong used to be very happening with crocodile farm and Tang Dynasty. World class bird park with entertaining shows. Must visit the wings of Asia and the Philippines eagle.

Coincide with the 50 years anniversary where entrance fee is $2.50. Also probably the last time to visit the Jurong Bird Park before it is being relocated to the Mandai area, the landscape and definitely brought back countless memories.. the bird shows are still good, more of a walk down the memory lane and to see the new attractions within.. definitely worth bringing the family to visit again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/12/8b/af/facebook-avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r781605798-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,thetravellingfugu,Perfect for bird lovers,50,28-Oct-20,"Decided to visit before this park relocates to Mandai in the next few years. I believe this attraction is often overlooked by many in favour for the zoo and river/night safaris. I loved my visit here. Also signed up for the 'birds eye tour'ù, a behind-the-scenes tour that allowed me to get up close with a hornbill, owl, hawk and 18-day old cockatiel and talk to their keepers. It was a real eye-opener and interactive experience. Strongly recommend watching their shows and attending the feeding sessions as well.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/15/0c/84/1a/thetravellingfugu.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r775800032-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,William C,A Heaven and Sanctuary for all Avian species,50,17-Jul-20,"I've been to Jurong Bird park many times in fact I couldn't remember. Whenever I have friends and families visiting me or with my friend here in SG or just by myself this is one of my go to favorite destinations. Built in 1971 it was first located in Jurong Hills then moved to Mandai Lake in 2020, in the Western part of Singapore with an area of 20 Hectares and shelters about 12,000 animals this is one of the world's best and most beautiful bird parks. Exhibits in the park include the Waterfall Aviary, with one of the world's tallest man made waterfalls at 30 meters nestled in the middle of a tropical like forest with streams and real life suspension bridge that gives you a panoramic view of the falls. The Aviary mainly focus on African birds which are free flying within the Aviary. The Dinosaur descendants houses large extant and flightless birds that include Crane, Ostriches, Cassowary to name a few. Wings of Asia houses about 200 species of Southeast Asian birds with different aviaries. Lorry Loft is the world's largest walk-in aviary at 9 stories high that house over 1000 lorries. Penguin coast houses the King penguin, African, Humboldt penguins etc, which lived in Indoor climate controlled den suitable for Penguins. Pelican cove is a beautiful man made lake that houses different species of Pelicans. There is a board walk also where visitors can view them closely. There are there different types of Flamingo Pool and Lake that houses Greater and Lesser Flamingos as well as the Caribbean Flamingo. And finally the Birds of Prey, where the mighty raptors are based including vultures, hawks and the critically endangered Philippine Eagles, one of the world's largest Eagles and there are two of them located here, which just opened this year. I personally visited this July to witness and support these Amazing birds of prey for the continued sustainability of their species. During my visit the cost of membership is at 39 dollars and gives me a year of membership privilege and free access which is very much worth the price and you're also supporting the birds in captivity inside. Other attractions in the park include shows like King of the Skies (Birds of Prey) and High Flyers (Different birds species). There are plenty of eateries and vending machines inside including drinking water fountain. Shops are available upon exit for your perfect memorabilia and souvenirs. The park itself is very well managed, maintained, clean and to sum it up - very beautiful. Finally, despite me visiting this park a lot of times, each time I go here it still feels my first time - always excited, surprised and delighted. I will surely be back for more :=)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r760272586-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

If one Zoo is no longer fit for purpose, get a new Zoo! The Bird Park is a ""must see"" in Singapore, and has been since it opened in 1971. I first saw the Zoo not long fter it opened.

Jurong Bird Park,Naomi Philippa H,Five Blissful Hours in Jurong Bird Park,50,17-Mar-20,"As a family, we love birds of every kind. I guess our feathered friends know it, because year after year the red-cheeked, red-vented, crested bulbuls we get in South India, have nested in our apartment balcony and successfully raised a family of three fledglings every time. Obviously when in Singapore, a visit to Jurong Bird Park would be high on our list.We did not expect to be so overwhelmed. Such beauty, such colour, such character, such birdsong...it was like Heaven on Earth! The enclosures give visitors a most thorough viewing of the different kinds of birds and we were fortunate enough to be in time for a charming display in one of the many ""amphitheatres"" in the park after which we had the opportunity to be photographed with them. In one of the enclosures we walked ""in the treetops"" while birds sang and chattered alongside us, completely unafraid. I felt awe and humility in the presence of such unique, beautiful, and intelligent creatures.

Jurong Bird Park,birdman222015,With A trip one of the best bird parks,50,18-Jan-20,It is a ways out to see Juron in the west ... rumour from the cabbie (we took the MRT then a cab ) is it is to be moved closer to the Singapore Zoo rather than birds to the west and the zoo to the north .

I saw 2 species in the wild in Malaysia but too see the Rhino Horbill close was good. it is good spot,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0f/64/ff/5c/birdman222015.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r739702445-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

I have read that it will be turned into an industrial site. Because of the vegetation Jurong is exquisite. The carers are great but the exhibit near the entrance with a rather large grey rare bird had dead fish to ear. Maybe they should have a aerated pond with frequently stocked Live fish instead of dead fish.

Jurong Bird Park,NinaAsia,Very educational trip,50,11-Sep-19,"A regular visitor at the Jurong Bird Park, I've always enjoyed all the shows which often have fresh content. New species of birds on display. You might even see an iguana or two.My favourite is the Toucan/Hornbill section. But do get behind the aviaries where the birds are hiding. There a slope for easy access at the extreme left facing the aviaries.Really liked the updates on the status of the birds on their description boards so that we do not become unwitting supporters of illegal trade. For example, I did not know that Grey Parrots are now considered endangered. TTIf you plan to stay until the park closes at 6pm, and catch bus service 194 to Boon Lay MRT, take the bus from the side of the park. If you cross the road to the opposite bus stop, you will probably miss a few buses as they will be too crowded to board.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/f0/4b/7b/ninaasia.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r708710901-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

There are some domesticated birds flying around freely in the park as well as the odd lemur and cameleon in the trees. There's an audio train in English if you don't feel like walking. You can feed the Lori's for a small fee.

Jurong Bird Park,BobSt23,Reliable Fun,50,1-Sep-19,"Jurong Bird Park is one of the 4 parks available on the good-value multi-park tickets. While the Zoo and the River Safari were underwhelming, the Bird Park never fails to impress. It's just a fun place to go for all age groups and the variety of species on show is sizeable. And unlike the larger animals at the Zoo, birds tend to be active all day. The layout of the park is user-friendly with one long perimeter loop making all enclosures easy to navigate. There is the bird staple where you can have parrots sit on you while you feed them. There is a shuttle cart to take you around if you don't wish to walk and there is a water park for the kids to splash around in. The food options are typically expensive and not particularly high quality.

Jurong Bird Park,aniruddhahomr,"Penguins, Loris, Flamingos, Parrots, and nature 'ì worth day out",50,24-Aug-19,"Jurong Bard Park (JBP) is an unique bird park covering 49 acres of land with over 200 species of bird of which most of the birds are from South Asia. JBP has many sections which one traveler can see through extensive walks. The other options is by internal tram ride. Several pairs of tramps are moving around at a regular interval from a place closed to the main entry. Tramp tickets are included with the entry tickets and so it is better to use tramps which touches three stations, Lory Loft, Waterfall Aviary, and Parrot Paradise. On the other side of the Parrot Paradise there is a huge open space of variety of storks.Penguin Coast is at the right side of the entry which is truly an artificially created amazing environment of penguins. This is certainly attractive for kids but travelers of all age enjoy watching their activities, especially interaction between mothers and young penguins.After that we took the tram ride to Lory Loft. Lory is a kind of parrot and Loft is arguably the largest open cage of the world housed almost 1,000 lories. Lories are so colorful that sometimes they look like rainbow.From Lory Loft we moved to Waterfall Aviary where again we observed few colorful bird species and an artificial waterfall. Here there is a small drinks and snacks shop with open sitting space where travelers can take rest, have some food, refill drinking water in the bottle, and also go to restroom.Next is Parrot Paradise, which literally is a paradise of parrots. The best in this station is of course Blue Macaw. On the other side of this station traveler can spend some time watching activities of thousands of storks of different species. It was truly worth to spend some time over there and walk instead of taking the tram to go back to the original starting point.Jurong Bird Park is certainly an excellent park where traveler of any age will enjoy spending few hours with birds of different species and enjoy cool time.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/14/76/ce/40/aniruddha-hom-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r702493763-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Parolekar,Outstanding Experience,50,17-Jun-19,"For those travelers who have been to other Bird Parks...dont just go by the name. Its a treat to visit this park.Very meticulously planned.Buy tickets for Jurong park with tram ride.There are 4-5 small blocks to be visited in the park. The tram has 4 stops and it takes you around. You can get down at any stop of your interest and visit that area.Recommended method.First sit in the tram and resist your temptation to get down at every stop.See all the stops in one circuit and then get down to doing each segment one by one.One section has a mini splash park for kids. Owing to the weather of Singapore, the kids are giong to love this.....but be careful....get into it only if you have a full day for the Park, else avoid it.Recommended to start the tour in the morning and definitely dont miss the BIRD SHOW at the AMPHITHEATER. 11:00 & 3;00 pm everyday.Worth a visit for all age groups.Has a limited variety of restaurants also. For Indians, soth indian cuisine available in a restaurant just outside the park.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r682133549-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

The parakeets, cockatoos, lories are not shy to fly down close to humans.//In the mid- to late 1990s, staff realised they should not be making the birds do stunts that a human could do.The birds were then trained to showcase their natural abilities instead, such as swooping above the audience's heads or engaging in cheeky banter with the presenter.//",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r679874682-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

They have interactive bird shows like 'Kings of the skies' showing prey animals and a Parrot show at the Pools Amphitheatre. Many more shows I guess which I couldn't explore. These shows are a must watch for all ages as they are very entertaining. You can roam around the park on a tram which halts at stations designated for specific bird enclosure.

It is a fascinating zoo containing many birds roaming either in very big cages, or entirely freely. It was amazing to see very rare birds completely in the open and not flying away anywhere. Apparently, they must be well treated and well fed. There was also an enclosed area within which many birds could roam freely. They were very tame and used to humans. You could watch some rare birds from up close. Highly recommended, and I look forward to going again, but next time, I will allow a whole day.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f6/0d/default-avatar-2020-34.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r677320737-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jac ask why we needed to optimise the route.. 'we have complimentary passes for a year'ù let just... WALK. Boss has spoken. Without putting any more thought into it.. we just headed off. I think we started near the exit.We loved the enclosures, the smaller aviaries, I mean. Amazing.. had birds flying all around you as you walk through.. and there was one were you could even buy nectar water of some kind to feed the birds, which was really really nice.Walking around we spent the good park of 4 hours at the park, and we didn't even get to the waterfall aviary but we can come another time though.It was an awesome morning spent and since it was past 2.30 pm already, with stomachs growling, we decided to bid a fond adieu...",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/b5/e2/74/geraldbslim.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r677006996-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,chephrenchua,Very interesting place to visit for at least half a day,50,19-May-19,"As a local, I only visit when there are visiting friends and they don't disappoint. The Entrance itself already features lots of eatery and well design garden and clean toilets, Upon entry, the penguin is just next to it on the right, where you can enjoy the cool aircondition away from the heat before or after the walk about.Walking further in is where you buy the tram ticket, which is for whole day ride, priced at SGD $5 for adult and $3 for children. As this place is not as crowded as zoo, the wait is quick, only 4 stops and every stops deserve a visit.Station 2 is where you can feed the birds, walk the hanging bridge, see horbill and their beautiful song, walking further down the road is the HUGE birds of prey, vultures and eagles.Station 3 is a man made waterfall, you come in contact with birds and lots of peacock roaming around you, just keep your kids hand to themselves please.Station 4 is where you visit the beautiful parrots, touted as the only one in the world, their call is loud and you may even get to hear them speak. walking further down is the flamingo valley, at least a hundred of them standing together.The timing not to miss are the feeding of birds of prey 10am and 4pm, feeding of penguin 10:30am and 3:30pm, bird show at 3 and 4pm, parrot show at 1pm. Sorry I am not too sure about the timing, please check with the park rangers at the park.So your kids can enjoy bird feeding and penguin feeding, don't miss visiting during the right hour.There are cafe and pizza place plus indian restaurants around the bird park, feel free to visit empty stomach and eat there, water fountain are plenty, so no risk of dehydration.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/e5/56/17/chephrenchua.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r674793588-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,NandanRao,Thoroughly enjoyable,50,12-May-19,"Birds, birds and more birds! We were wondering if there would be something to see for more than 2 hours and we were so wrong! Once can spend a day entirely in this bird park. The park itself is spread across a huge area and is divided into bird exhibits from various parts of the world.The enclosures are not suffocating for the birds and in many of those enclosures, you can actually get inside to spot the birds, some of them friendly and some shy away. It is a fun exercise to do with young children.Birds not to miss- Penguins at the entrance (I felt a bit of pity to see that they had the least space as it requires cooling)- Lory Loft- Hornbills an Toucans- High flyers Show (at 11:00am in the Pools Amphitheater)- Waterfall Aviary - Definitely a Must See- Parrot ParadiseMake sure to take the Tram ticket as it can be convenient to go from one place to another at timesPlan to spend at least 4 hours (Including the show) and if you are with kids who are excited add some more time as there is also a play area",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/d3/a6/2e/nandan-rao.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r673434726-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,lingh_sg,Locals should visit too!,50,9-May-19,"The last time I went to the Bird Park was around 25 years ago... back then, I was unimpressed with the place, preferring the Singapore Zoological Gardens (which I loved as a child then).25 years later, I'm back with a little bub of my own who loves birds, and I am very impressed with how much the park has changed since then. The bird shows were fun, with interactive segments. There's a water playground -- a favourite with children, so bring your swimsuits, sunblock & a change of clothes! You can actually walk around the whole park with some rest in between, but it can get very hot, so purchasing those tram tickets can help those with movement challenges / elderly / with babies. For parents, bring your strollers, the paths are generally wide & flat - although there's a few exhibits where you'll need to fold-up your stroller and carry it up some stairs and/or the paths are narrower and it's just easier to park your stroller outside & carry your kid around.Unless you're a bird fanatic, half a day will be adequate for covering all the exhibits. Pack your own lunches, there're sitting areas with tables where you can have a picnic, though bear in mind that many are unshaded.

If you're allergic to them, kindly keep away since you would be surrounded with hundreds of birds to get the feed from you. It will try getting over you from the front & behind.You could also get to click a picture with some exotic/rare birds but it comes at a cost. If you don't mind spending money, do go for it.

There's a bird show also (held twice a day for about half hour duration) wherein the trained birds perform various tasks and they can even talk to the trainer. There are trams to take you to various places so that you don't waste time to visit various locations.

Quite a few of these birds are on the verge of extinction or are very rare to sight in natural habitats. This aviary is planned to be moved to an alternate location near the zoo on Mandai Lake Road.Jurong Bird Park has several bird species including a large flock of flamingos. It is currently the world's largest bird park in terms of the number of birds and second largest both in the number of bird species and land area. The biggest on this criteria exists in Germany.The aviary has several areas which can be visited like Waterfall Aviary, Dinosaur Descendants, Lory Loft, Wings of Asia, World of Darkness, Parrot Paradise, Penguin Coast, Flamingo Pool & Flamingo Lake, etc. We also liked the Breeding and Research Centre which shows how the rescued birds are cared for and some of the important research work going on here.There are a few Bird shows which one must go for - High Flyers show, Kings of the Skies show and Lunch with Parrots. All the shows ensure good participation from the tourists visiting the park.There is a nice tram which we used to travel all across the aviary.

To get there I took the MRT on the green East-West line and got off at Boon Lay MRT station. The public bus number 194 goes from Boon Lay MRT to the front gate of the Jurong Bird Park in about 7 minutes. You can do the same on the return trip but have to walk across the road in the pedestrian tunnel to catch the 194 bus on the other side of the road to return to Boon Lay MRT station.Being so far out of town the park wasn't crowded compared to other Singaporean attractions and I bought my entry ticket at the gate without queuing. You have the option to pay $5 for unlimited use of the tram inside the bird park, I definitely recommend this even for a keen walker, as the tram does loops of the park which makes it easy to move around and see which sites worth visiting.This bird park have some unique birds I haven't anywhere else and the park have plenty of lush green gardens with flowering plants and scenic lakes. The main highlight is the 11am show at the Pools Amphitheatre, but the penguin feeding and the 30 metre tall waterfall were also very impressive.You can buy food and drink from several outlets inside the park which even has a Pizza Hut, and well maintained restrooms are scattered throughout.

Jurong Bird Park,NinaadD,Brilliant!,50,29-Nov-18,"Our visit was filled with awe and awesome. Each display is large enough to let the birds move about in unrestricted fashion, which made me less guilty for seeing them in captivity. The one big loop layout makes walking along effective and non-repetitive. The extra money for including the shuttle pass is totally worth it. The displays are large enough with several birds that make it easy to spot them while in the shuttle.Kid and husband enjoyed feeding the birds a lot. Unfortunately by the time I got my turn the birds had been given a snack of grapes and thus non were around. Witnessing the interaction with birds during this feeding left me speechless. The birds communicated with movements and it was clear what they were trying to convey. This is an experience that shall forever stay with me.The park has a very interesting water play area, where the kid spend well over 3 hours and had to be coerced out at closing.While he was enjoying the cold splash I got to chat with Maggie on staff, who was studying lightening data for the park system. We had an insightful conversation about Singapore food culture, other playground, diversity, education system and what not. A big shout out to her for helping me understand Singapore a lot more.We had an amazing day and wish there was more time to go once again during the week long vacation.The cafes have great food options and the gift shop has some real neat stuff for sale.The restroom designs are very clever and they are maintained extremely efficiently.

Pigeons, doves, parrots, flamingos, pelicans, hornbills - you are going to surely have a great time amidst nature.I recommend buying tickets online, for there is a long queue at the ticketing counters at the park and thus, it costs time. Taxi is the best way to come to Jurong Bird Park, since the MRT-Bus Combo takes a very long time and is inconvenient, too.Lory Loft, Waterfall Aviary, Wings of Asia, Royal Ramble, the show, Flamingo and Pelican Lakes, Hornbills, are some of the many sights worth visiting. Not to forget the beautiful Penguin Coast just at the entrance.There are many dining options there, with Pizza Hut Express being inside the premises of Jurong Bird Park. I recommend buying the ticket for the unlimited Tram Ride too, if travelling with elderly or small children.

Jurong Bird Park,USACorgi,"For Bird geeks, its awesome! But fun for all...",50,9-Nov-18,"I went here about 6 years ago for the first time and loved it so much. It was a must see on this trip back to Singapore and wasnt disappointed. They have added quite a bit since I was here last time and really improved other attractions. Took us about 3 hours to tour the park. I was especially excited for the rare macaws that are on display ....the Spix;s for example are extinct in the wild and only 150 in captiviity, so it was a real treat to get to see them in person. I love feeding the lories and lorikeets in their massive aviary but it did seem like there were much fewer in number than last time I was here. Most people seemed to have a hard time getting enough birds to drink all the nectar they provide. Most everyone just set the little cups down because there arent enough birds interested in coming around to drink the nectar. Anyway, its worth the trip out to Jurong. TAkes about 45mins from downtown. We took the green line all the way to Boon Lay station from City Hall. Didn't have to change lines that way. Then you transfer to the 194 bus for about 10 mins and it drops you off in front of the park. Cost us S$1.60 each for the bus, you need exact change and just pay on the bus. The bus depot at Boon Lay station is easy to navigate and find the bus. Definitely cant wait to go back!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0e/e4/17/01/usacorgi.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r632066117-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Redhead_archer,I wish I could rate this 100 Star.,50,6-Nov-18,"Best place in the world. Period.I pre booked my ticket online and planned out my 5 days in Singapore from Australia, scheduling the bird park for the first day. 3 days later we ran around the aquarium as fast as we could just to make a second trip to Jurong again.I am a zoo keeper and love visiting zoos in different countries. I had always heard great things about Jurong from fellow bird lovers, keepers and breeders. I was not dissatisfied at all!We decided to do the Birds Eye Tour where we got to meet a beautiful hornbill names Sally (shout out to her keeper Maddy!). We also got to fly a bird of prey on the glove. Our tour guide Grace was amazing. Such a beautiful person who couldn't love her job anymore and was just happy to show people around in hopes her enthusiasm for the birds would rub off.After the tour, we met up with Peter the hornbill keeper who took a good hour out of his extremely busy day to educate us on his birds. I started off knowing absolutely nothing about hornbills, to them being one of my favorite birds. Thank you so much Peter for your hospitality! This guy needs a pay rise, such a legend.I'd also like to mention Mark in the breeding centre. He introduced us to a baby spoonbill which we got to feed, and we joked about how much of a pain eclectus parrots are to handraise. He had a smile on his face the whole time.In Australia, zoo keepers always seem to want to 'one up'ù each other in their facilities and keep training tips to themselves because they don't want another zoo to be 'better' than them, but Jurong was nothing like that. Grace mentioned that if any of my keeping friends wanted help knowing how to breed certain birds, Jurong would love to give them some tips. That's what the bird world is all about. Helping each other out.So not only was the staff AMAZING but the actual exhibits were next level. The lory loft was my personal favorite as I am obsessed with lorikeets and own and handraised a few of my own. The waterfall exhibit with the African greys also gets a special mention.So thanks Jurong for being the best bird park around and now my all time favorite zoo.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0a/03/e1/6b/stephlaurenx.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r631163669-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,fperegrinus,Where colors live,50,27-Oct-18,"Jurong Bird Park is one of my favorite places to spend a whole day whenever I visit the modern and vibrant Merlion City.Jurong Bird Park is Asia's largest, with a collection of over 5,000 birds from 400 species, including some endangered species like the birds of paradise, macaws, birds of prey, etc.This bird park offers so much fun and education towards its visitors about the life of bird. There are some exhibits and two that I like most are the ""Penguin Coast"" and the ""World of Darkness"". In Penguin Coast you will see how several penguin species are put together in a coastal-area-like exhibit. They can swim and hop on rocky surfaces, while sometimes they will just lay down and cooling themselves lazily on the ice made by the ice machine. You must come to their feeding time to see them swimming to catch fish from their keepers.The World of Darkness exhibit is home to several owl species. Since most owl species are nocturnal, the ambience is controlled in such a way that inside the owl exhibit, the day time is turned into night time. Thus, you will see the owls actively flying and preening their feathers, also hunting for food. However, the last time I visit the park, they already closed down the owl exhibit.The highlight of the bird park in my opinion, is the bird show. You must not miss the two bird shows, the ""High Flyers"" and the ""King of the Skies"". The High Flyers show will let you see some bird species demonstrate their ability, like the talking parrots. While the King of the Skies show will let you mesmerized by the keen senses of birds of prey when they are hunting for food in the wild. You should also see the feeding frenzy of the pelican, the keepers will introduce you to the 9 pelican species in the bird park while feeding them their favorite fish. It is a trully nice experience to have since some of the pelicans will fly above your head with their massive wingspan, circling around the pond, yet they are not flying away.Jurong Bird Park, in my opinion, is a must visit place when you go to Singapore. It is one good place for adult and children alike to learn a lot about the life of bird and the conservation efforts done by the Wildlife Reserve Singapore to save them from extinction.""Jurong Bird Park - Where color lives""p.s. I do not know if it is a temporary program or not, but if you fly Singapore Airlines or SilkAir, do not forget to bring your boarding pass with you to the park to get a 10% discount on your admission fee.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/15/b4/b9/ed/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r628624742-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,AJAY M,great place to visit,50,24-Oct-18,"- The jurong bird park can be easily termed as the best Singapore attraction. So many birds with so much chirping was extraordinary. The 2nd tram stop of Lory Loft with parrot feeding was out of world. - There are two shows i.e.1000 hrs (king of sky/ eagle show) and 1045 hrs (high flyers show). The high flyer show was great and should not be missed. But as we reached late, we missed the 1000 hrs show. The same show is repeated at 1600 hrs. But we could not wait till then and left at 1430 hrs. So either you reach 0930 hrs or 1400 hrs. There are also bird feeding shows of penguins and pelican. Both were great and are must watch.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r627719744-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Shihoko P,Loved spending my final hours in Singapore here :),50,5-Oct-18,"Must love birds. I caught the 194 bus from Boon Lay (apparently the only bus to the park). The good thing is that the bus stop on the way home is the same stop (glad I asked the driver). It's a brief walk across the road to the park. Entry is reasonable, and more cost effective if you are considering going to some of the other attractions (had I known this, I might have spent my time a little differently). The park is around 2km in distance, and is designed so you walk a circuit to see all the areas. There is a train which is hop on/off for $5, however I preferred the exercise. You need to be able bodied to have the best experience. For example, the toucans were best viewed from the second level, and the lory loft feels like a ropes course. The highlight of my day was the show in the amphitheatre, up close with the macaws, flamingos (why do they not fly away?!), toucans etc. It was a fabulous way to spend half the day on the last one for my trip.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/15/51/9f/72/shihoko.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r622299538-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,sojamB,Bucket list day,50,4-Oct-18,"Our kids have a thing for birds! With no Toucans in Australia this was our little boys, 9, first chance to see a toucan. Just prior to the bird show we asked a staff member if there was any chance at all that he could see a toucan up close after the show, he said sure he can hold them! So our boy got to be the child in the audience who had two toucans land on his arms. The smile on his face I won't ever forget!!I would suggest planning your day priority bird wise as it is over quite a large area and the heat/humidity factor takes its toll on walking. The huge aviary was pretty impressive, the bird shows a must do. The gardens are lovely too and a cool off splash in the water park helped give the kids enough energy for the trip home.We did the MRT /bus option, which took about an hour from the CBD including waiting for the bus.

Jurong Bird Park,Ricky Y,Amazing collection of birds at one place,50,1-Oct-18,"If you love birds, this is one place you must go when you are in Singapore since it carries so many species of birds around the world that it is like a one stop sees all instead of having to travel to different corners of the world. To start with, the High Fly Show at the open air Amphitheatre is a definite treat to children in particular as those toucans, hornbills and colorful macaws followed the instructions of their trainers and then the finale of hundreds of flamingoes and pelicans swarming the stage was breath taking. Make sure you allot enough time to tour the Park as you probably would need to go through signs in front of cages to see which birds you are watching and then finding them sometimes also takes some effort.

Please study the timings for the individual shows; the birds of prey, and the parrots shows, and make it for them. The birds and their keepers are so much fun to watch in interaction rather than in their enclosures. The walk inside the park is rather long between the different bird enclosures. It would be wise to carry water bottles.A word of caution, the multiple park ticket has to be redeemed at the Zoo first, so it is possible to visit Jurong only after that.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r615033497-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,hoifeik,Plenty to do and see. Worth getting an annual membership even for tourists,50,1-Sep-18,"Went to Jurong bird park during our stay in Singapore. It was really easy to get to by public transport. We took the MRT to Boon Lay and then took the bus 194, which took us right in front of the bird park.After the high flyers show, we walked around the park and had some lunch. It was very hot. My children spent a long time at the waterplay so we ran out of time to see some of the birds. On leaving the park, we enquired about converting the day tickets to membership and it was a straightforward process after a SGD8 top up (as one of us is a Singaporean, we paid less on the day ticket). We went again the next day and as it was a weekday, we could go on the tram for free as members (otherwise, we would have to pay SGD16 for the whole family). We went to the Rory loft and other places.If I had noticed the price for the family membership, I would have paid for the membership earlier and then we could have got on the tram to save some walking the first day.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r612774727-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

I have never seen so many diverse and colourful types of birds in one location. The layout of the park is impressive. There are the open air enclosures with pelicans, the closed enclosures with hawks, and the walk through enclosures of huge proportions with other diverse birds. I definitely recommend that you add this to one of the places to visit when in Singapore, because I doubt whether you will find anywhere better. A practical tip, not advertised in any guidebook that I have seen, is that if you arrived in Singapore by Singapore Airlines you get 10% off the admission price, but you need to produce your boarding pass (the electronic version is fine).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r610032359-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,pradrao60,Family-friendly Adventure!,50,24-Aug-18,"Visiting Jurong Bird Park in Singapore is a family-friendly adventure, to see various bird species, from parrots to penguins. You can also ride the 'Panorail' (in air-conditioned comfort) for a panoramic look at the bird park.Set on 50 acres (20 hectares) of verdant green space, Jurong Bird Park is home to thousands of birds across hundreds of species. We can enjoy quality family-time at the various attractions, such as the 'Birds & Buddies' show, which runs twice a day and features characters in colourful costumes. We need to check the show schedule at the park when we arrive, as other shows too take place during the day.We stopped by the African wetlands exhibit to see African birds in their habitat of ferns, palms and native-style pavilions and learnt about the environmental balance in which birds and humans both live. We also entered a misty jungle-style habitat at the Waterfall Aviary. We didn't miss the penguin exhibit, which features an underwater viewing gallery to watch the penguins. We were able to feed fish to the penguins in the open arena on the opposite side.We watched the show ""Birds of Prey"", featuring vultures, hawks, owls, etc., beautifully trained and handled by the Park attendants. The next show was called ""High Flyers"", featuring multi-coloured Parakeets and Macaws, performing flying feats, and showing amazing skill by flying through loops and obeying the commands of their trainers. One Macaw was able to recite songs in Chinese and call out numbers from one to ten in three languages!! It was a tremendous experience, to be specially enjoyed by young and old. The finale was a grand parade of Pelicans and Flamingos!It is truly astounding that the trainers have shown patience and spent countless hours training these birds.A ""NOT TO BE MISSED"" visit!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/14/4b/18/bd/pradrao60.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r609851548-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

The aviaries are huge. One has a 30 metre waterfall inside of it and a bridge from which you can look down on the waterfall. There are a lot of rare birds here, and some good explanatory displays. I particularly liked the blue macaws - I had seen pictures of them, but until my visit, I had no idea they were nearly 1 metre long from their beaks to the tips of their tail feathers.

We visited with 3 adults and 2 children (6yo and 7yo) and there was something for everyone. The birds of prey show was particularly well done with some unique birds that you wouldn't normally encounter in this type of show. The bird park also so many collections of species you wouldn't see elsewhere (macaws, hornbills and toucans in particular. But if these highlights still aren't enough there is a vast collection of other birds on show. The area is bigger than we expected but there's a train that runs around the park. We walked most of it but took the train when it was time to go home. Also take bathers because there's a fantastic water playground where the kids can play and refresh themselves with some water play. Excellent change facilities available and if you forget the bathers you can buy at the shop at reasonable prices. But no bathers no play! All in all a fantastic day out. Well done Jurong Bird Park.

Jurong Bird Park,Dasaman W,Yet another 'must do' in Singapore especially if you have kids,50,20-Aug-18,It was simply amazing. We enjoyed the Kings of the Sky show and the Pelican Chit Chat. The waterfall arena was simply amazing .....cannot do justice to this place with a few words because there were so many wonderful aspects. The aviaries have been done with so much thought to detail its just really wonderful. And as a bonus there is this huge play area for kids which allows parents to catch their breath after a long walk inside. But please remember to take your kids swim suits as otherwise they miss out on just one part of the play area...,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0d/a0/88/16/dasaman-w.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r608259417-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,Craig W,Awesome,50,19-Aug-18,Definitely worth the visit. Cab fare is about $20 from the city centre. Make sure you catch the bird show. Took my elderly parents who caught the free tram from. Point to point while we walked. You will need to walk to see all the displays. Takes about 4 hours to do the park if you walk. There is a steep hill to walk up during one section so keep that in mind with kids.

The Macaws and raptors were very impressive.

Jurong Bird Park,TheGrifs,A worthwhile visit,50,12-Jul-18,"We almost did not go to Jurong Bird Park because the reviews on TripAdvisor were so mixed. We were glad we made the effort as it was an excellent day out.Getting there - we took the MRT (Boon Lay MRT) and then crossed over to the bus terminal and got the 194 bus which drops you off just outside the park (this is contrary to what Google Maps will tell you - it says to catch the bus from a different location; this is incorrect). It takes about 70-80 minutes to get to Jurong Bird Park from central Singapore.Layout - The park is well laid out and as it is situated on the side of a hill you do quite a bit of uphill and downhill walking. For those who do not want to walk around the park there is a tram that circles the park and costs $5 per adult for unlimited hop on hop off.The Park - We loved the shows, especially the High Flyers Show (sit in the middle just below half way if you want to have a good chance of being selected for audience participation), the Lory Loft where the birds sit on your arm, shoulders and head to get food or nibble at your cap and the Hornbills & Toucans display. The Parrot Paradise is also worthwhile. The Breeding & Research Centre and Bird Discovery Centre are also good (both are air conditioned and also provide interesting educational material and the chance to see birds being incubated and new hatchlings).We found the park to be clean and the bird cages were well maintained. There were plenty of staff all over the park ensuring that the surrounds were kept neat and tidy.Food & Water - There are a number of food outlets across the park and free water refill stations across the park so make sure you bring a water bottle with you. We had lunch at the Hawk Cafe which has a range of local food for around $8 - just remember to get a stamp to come back in after lunch as you access the cafe through the exit shop.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0e/39/3d/6a/thegrifs.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r595522978-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Jessica L,4-in-1 ticket.,50,10-Jul-18,"We got there by public transport and it was easy enough. We took the East-West MRT line and got off at Boon Lay, where we followed signs to the bus interchange and took Bus No. 194, which takes you to the front of the park.If you can, it's worth catching the shows. Token feeding (for S$2) of the African Penguins near the entrance was a highlight. We spend about 4 hours at the park.I bought the 4-in-1 park hopper ticket. I paired Jurong bird park with River Safari, followed by Rainforest Lumina (a separate ticket, not covered in the 4-in-1 ticket) in the one day. Looking back, I think it was a good decision.To get between Jurong Bird Park and Singapore Zoo, there is a shuttle for S$6pp, but the person at the stand (at front of the bird park) told us it only operates on the hour. We just missed one, so we were going to line up for the taxi, wanting to not waste time.

Jurong Bird Park,akshay21t,Worth A Visit - Young Kids - Dont forget swimming constumes,50,6-Jul-18,"The way to plan the itinary out for the visit is to first find out which are the shows and where . I was travelling with young kids and what we did was first took a tour of the whole place via the tram which gave us an idea of what are the different attractions in the place. ( You can get the same by the map as well but a quick tour gives a different perspective )* We mapped out the different shows that we wanted to see and made sure that we cover the adjacent areas and attractions.* Make sure that you get to feed the birds, its a wonderful activity :)Downside -The only downside was they had a kids playing area with fountains and swings for the kids. A part of the area was only accessible if the kids were wearing a swimming costume. The swimming Costumes over there were exorbitant and hardly any choice and we had a hard time explaining that to the kids.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/b8/4a/68/akshay-t.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r593511183-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Really nice to walk around - we bought the tram ticket and used it twice interspersed with walking.For visitors - note, we had only been in Singapore for 36 hours and it was really warm & humid which probably meant we left earlier than we did - its a long way from the centre of the city.

Jurong Bird Park,HappyHuttleys,Colourful Birds Aplenty - Great Day at Jurong Bird Park,50,2-Jul-18,"We started off early to be there at opening time 8.30am. MRT to Boon Lay then a bus from the Terminal to Jurong - this is well sign posted from the MRT. Although we had purchased tickets at Changi the ticket voucher still needed to be changed at the ticket office. We took the tram around the Park to give us an overview of the park as we had partially planned the day to include both the Bird of Prey and High Flyers Shows. We started at the Lory Loft the large free flying aviary - this was fabulous with lots of colourful birds flying and walking around the aviary. We were there at feeding time so were able to be very close to the birds, they flew onto our hand too. We saw lots of birds we hadn't seen before, it was great to learn that Jurong also does conservation work for endangered species like the Hyacinth Macaw - a beautiful bright blue Macaw. As we walked around the Park we stopped by the Keepers who gave talks about the birds under their care. Times are well signposted for these talks. The Hornbill and Toucans are fascinating birds !!The two bird shows were excellent particular the Birds of Prey which featured Eagles,Hawks and Vultures.The Waterfall Aviary is beautiful with lots of birds wandering and flying about. The Waterfall walk takes you both below and above the waterfall - great place for photos.You will need a minimum of 4 hours ( includes Shows ) to have a good look at what is at the Park.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/1c/14/84/happyhuttleys.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r592217035-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Amit P,Awesome time with Birds!!,50,1-Jul-18,"Its a perfect place to spend the day in Singapore. There a large variety of birds to see (variety of Horn Bills is especially impressive) and very informative especially for the kids. You get a taste of little bit of wilderness and its difficult to believe that you are smack in centre of a bustling city. There are shows all day round, its recommended that you pick and choose which one you want to see and plan accordingly. There is tram to roam around in the park. Tram is more like a fun ride rather than a means to move around in the park since the area of park is not too large to walk. Tram ride is recommended and our ticket that we got from Klook.com included the tram ride. Bird show at 'Pools Amphitheatre' is must see, plan your activity around this. We could also see 'Horn bill' show which was very informative and the lady giving the information was too good. Reserve at least 4-5 hours for this attraction but you can easily spend a day here if you have time. Facilities inside Park are very good including toilets, drinking water and also food.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/05/ff/14/ca/amit-p.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r592049856-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

To our surprise there were only 4 of us at the show. That meant my son got to be the volunteer for every activity - and interacted with all sorts of birds. It was a trip highlight for him.Beware of the extremely high costs for photos with the birds. We paid anyway because who usually has the chance to hold a macaw?The birds are amazing and the park does a lot in terms of conservation. Highly recommended.

Jurong Bird Park,ChikafromCanada,An unparalleled bird extravaganza!,50,30-Jun-18,"I had bought the pass for the 4 wildlife parks in Singapore, including the trams. I had not planned to see the bird park but since I bought the pass which included it - I planned a short visit. To my incredible surprise, it was my favourite of the parks! Incredible birds in a beautiful setting, the pinnacle being the waterfall enclosure which surprised me at how such a large area was still enclosed for the birds safety, but it felt like it was entirely in the wild! My only complaint was the bars that get in the way of some picture taking, some of the birds were in large enclosures but thick bars are in the way of the viewer. The age of the park is most likely part of the issue, but having some plexiglass or a lighter style bar would be nice for viewers. Especially regarding the Hornbills (so many types!)It was rainy when I started my day... rather it was a downpour. So an umbrella plus a rain poncho were needed. There are not many spots to sit out a rain... but the birds were staying still and some were bathing in the rain, so it was good viewing regardless of the weather!The tram was a great way to get my bearings as to how the park is laid out... I rode the full route as it was pouring rain and I was killing time, turned out that it was a wonderful preview. Do not try to get pictures from the tram as it goes too fast, but pay attention to the sights it points out as these are great to get pictures of while you walk the route.Do not forget to bring money as it is 100% worth the few dollars to feed the Lory's at the Lori Loft. These bright colourful birds are a crowd favourite and will land on you to get the nectar from cups you hold. Both young children and adults get joy out of this experience!The enclosures where you can walk through and see the birds run and fly about are fabulous. The sounds and sights were memorizing. The nursery was wonderfully set up so you can see the process from eggs hatching to babies.I ended up staying the entire day at this park, a definite have too amongst Singapore's sights!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e9/60/default-avatar-2020-64.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r591783345-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Karen R,A MUST for bird lovers!,50,19-Jun-18,"My visit to the Jurong Bird Park of Singapore was one of the top highlights of my trip. The park has a wide collection of bird species from around the world and many shows throughout the day that highlight some of the birds. There is a tram, for a small extra fee, which makes loops around the somewhat large park, which is helpful. The most impressive area of the park to me was the waterfall aviary, which is the second-largest walk-in aviary in the world. The ""lory loft"" is a popular area, which allows an interaction with many lorikeets through feeding (small cups of sugar water can be purchased). The Jurong bird park is delightful and absoloutely one of the best aviary experiences I've ever had. I only had 4 hours in the park and wished I had longer, but I LOVE birds.

It also started raining in the high flyers (3pm 12/4/18) and the handler/ presenter handled it so well! She moved the birds out of the rain into the crowd and continued the show! I really have to commend her quick thinking and her confidence. The later show was good as well and the presenter was so enthusiastic with his facts. There was lots to lean within the park which I enjoyed. I spent three hours here would of spent probably 30 mins to and hour more if the park wasn't closing. You can feed and interact with lots of animals ( we fed the penguins at 3:30) for such a good price of $2!.I think they need to remove products that have palm oil, I saw some in the shop near the waterfall (tao kae noi seaweed snacks).

The forecasty was for afternoon so I decided to go to the park early to avoid this and the crowds and am glad I did. The mood was relaxing around the park at 9am when I arrived and I was able to check out a number of birds and take photos with no other people in them. I loved the immersive areas and the free range bird areas although I am not a fan of birds in cages so avoided most of the parrots. The shows were incredible though, especially the vultures in the birds of prey show. The staff are all very knowledgeable and they really push the conservation message which is great, even promoting bringing reusable water bottles and places to fill up on the way. The park is large but I managed to walk it in 3 hours without having to rely on the train which was pretty busy during the mid morning, The penguins were gorgeous and the puffins great to see and I loved the beautiful pink spoonbills and duck varieties.

Jurong Bird Park,Skeets2014,Amazing bird park!,50,8-Apr-18,"Jorong Bird Park is lively, colourful, and well-maintained. The aviaries are large and lush, giving the birds plenty of space to fly.

Jurong Bird Park,237sabnam,Jurong Bird Park,50,7-Apr-18,My family and i with two young kids visited the jurong bird park on the 5th of april 2018. Watched the shows and we simply loved both shows. Especially the High flyers show. We watched both the 11 and 3pm show.Both the presenters did an awesome job. Managed to see different kinds of birds compared from the 11am and 3pm such as the hornbill part.My kids had too many questions that they went down to ask the presenter. Both the ladies( couldn't remember their names. Oops) were very patient and answered my children's ridiculous questions in a kiddy way. Will definitely recommend the bird park and the High flyers show. Will be back again.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r571626405-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,961jenniec,Very entertaining,50,6-Apr-18,We spent a good 4 hours here. The shows are really good and the Hornbill Chat was outstanding. It is just a keeper with his bird explaining about them and answering any questionsYou need to plan your time here because there is lots to see and many of the specific activities are worth attending. Spend some time when you first get there to figure out what order to see the various birds and activities so you can maximise your experience.The array of birds is expansive.We went by MRT and connecting bus service which is perfectly synchronised. We took a shuttle service from there to the Zoo which cost $6.00. Not bad value considering the alternatives and how much time it saves.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r571450403-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Stephanddanieltravel,Good for a bird park,40,17-Feb-20,We are not bird people but it was included in our ticket for the zoo so thought why not go check it out.

Jurong Bird Park,Jennylee44,Well worth a visit.,40,12-Feb-20,The bird park is an underground ride to Jurong and a bus ride from the station. Very easy. The park is well laid out and labelled. It is not flat but not mountainous.We caught the tram ride to get orientated and here was our only disappointment. We thought we would hear birds singing and instead the tram has caned music. Not what we went to hear. For oldies it would be nice if the tram had a few more stops.The bird shows are a must and do walk through the aviary where the birds are flying all around you.The restaurant was a lovely place to take a break.

Jurong Bird Park,Nitwit2015,Birds paradise,40,11-Feb-20,The park is located slightly outside the city and I found it convenient taking a cab which charged us 18SGD from Farrer park. I was simply amazed to see all the different variety of birds at this park. Ideal place for kids and bird enthusiasts to make them familiar with the different species of birds. The park is huge so I suggest you could take the extra tram pass to make your trip comfortable. Do not miss the high flyer show which showcases the the talents of the parrots and macaus. The park has a few food outlets and sufficient toilets and water filling stations so as to make your trip comfortable.

Jurong Bird Park,Trip802892,Fun day at the park,40,7-Feb-20,"Went mid week with myself and 7 year old son. We enjoyed the park. The shows were especially well done. The presenters were articulate and able to keep the interest of the diverse crowd. They also spoke clearly, slowly and did not use Singlish. The diverse crowd came from many nations with English being the second or third language for many so keeping it simple was important.Tip: Do research on line for the times of the shows so you can plan your day accordingly.

The shows are also fantastic, so make sure you're aware in advance of the timings so you can align your visit with the shows. The only caveat is if there is heavy sustained rain then you will simply have to accept there's almost nothing to do and either have a coffee and hope it stops, or take a large umbrella and prepare to get wet or accept defeat and go home. What seems like indoor attractions (the waterfall and the lory feeding area) are actually netted roofing and offer no protection from the elements - so make sure you look at the weather forecast first :)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r743338595-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

The 30 minutes bird show at 11 am or 3 pm with toucans, parrots and other birds which perform sometimes very advanced tricks should not be missed.

There are birds from all over the world and many of them roam free in two large aviaries. I liked not knowing what was around the next corner as the vast majority of the birds in the aviaries have no fear of humans. The highlight for me was a 30 minute bird show that left every other shows we'd seen for dead. For seniors you may find, like us, that the park is a bit hilly but there is a tram ride that takes you to central locations around the park.This place was well worth the visit.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/4a/28/0d/ozjohnno.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r732119208-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,Kirkstead,Good experience soon to move,40,11-Dec-19,"It is 14 years since a last visit to this attraction and there have been some improvements along the way. There is an extensive range of aviaries and open water areas for the visitor to enjoy. Those who prefer can be transported around the site by a train (at extra cost). But it is quite manageable to walk. Some of the large walk through enclosures do offer very close encounters with an extensive range of species. There are a number of eating opportunit√©s although the buffet restaurant opens at 11.30am and was close closing at 13.00 when we walked in.The bird shows are a little like circus but the raptor show was more educational and less of a performance. Access is easy by public transport or taxi. We managed a special deal for entry as they had a promotion day.Several aviaries were closed to visitors for maintenance purposes and this was not, perhaps, obvious until we got to them.The Bird Park is moving soon to the Singapore Zoo site so it will be a whole new experience next time",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r731960124-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

The place is educational for the children. There are penguins, emu, stork, vultures, macaws and many more.If you don wan to walk too much, you can also opt for tram ride. There are different shows too, do refer to the brochure, they are worth stopping over to watch and hear the explanation by the park staff.With stopping to take pictures and rest stop for the legs, it takes about 2-3 hour slow leisure to complete the visit.Do have a good pair of walking shoes and bring water bottle with you to stay hydrated.

There was a man-made waterfall in a jungle like scene with lots of birds, butterflies, squirrels, racoons, however, was a bit disappointed as didnt get to see much of the larger birds, must have been hiding in the canopy....We got caught in an amazing rainstorm in the midst of our exploration and took cover at a way side stop and had to hurriedly wind up as all the birds were taking cover.... but it was great fun, trying to peak at the rest of the birds in the pouring rain and ensuring we had covered maximum exhibits.

They charge you for everything they can but they have to earn money. The highlights were the 11:45 a.m. Hornbill chit chat, the wildlife officer was excellent and informative and the Wings of Asia aviary where they all pretended they were dead on the path, the lowlight was the nagging feeling the birds would rather be anywhere else.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0a/a1/0f/7f/randolphcarter1919.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r720112233-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

In some of the aviaries, I have seen children chasing the birds, people feeding human food to the birds or harassing the birds for photographs or even using flash to take photographs of the birds.The bird shows are fantastic and so are the chit chat sessions.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/d4/6a/03/sightseer27214974851.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r712809771-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

If you are early in the park, you can try feeding the lories for 2 SGD per cup of feed. However, if you arrive near lunchtime, I wouldn't recommend it as the lories might be full already from previous feedings so your cup of feed might be wasted. Also, there are two majestic Philippine Eagles in the park that everybody should see.It is, admittedly, a bit of walk though, with some parts uphill.

Jurong Bird Park,Hwee F,Nice visit!,40,15-Sep-19,Hasn't been there for a while and I must say the roads are accessible everywhere for a pram. Visited during their admission period in celebration of their 10 years anniversary. Many sightseeing points were fenced up and require fees before entry so the admission to these places add up to almost the cost of an admission ticket. All in all nice weather and air that day of my visit! Good workout!,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r709908978-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,globetraveler4ever,Lots of beautiful birds,40,13-Sep-19,"Unfortunately as a tourist I unknowingly went on a day that free admission was offered to all Singapore citizens and residents so the place was packed. It was more like a zoo than a bird park! The line to get in was out the door and I paid full price admission and the cost of a taxi to get there so I just stuck it out.The place itself is great for viewing birds from all over the world, especially those that are endangered or near extinct, so that was nice to see the rarities, however, as an avid birder, it always pains me to see birds caged up that should be flying free. I find it very sad for the birds but it is a double edged sword, since some of these birds would be poached or sold for trade in the wild, and at least here they have some type of life, albeit, not a truly natural one.As far as the park goes, it is huge, and if you choose to walk the entire place like. I did, wear comfortable clothes and be prepared to sweat. There is a tram that you can take for an additional fee.As a health foodie I did not find there were many healthy food choices but if you are not picky there is plenty to eat, as long as you are willing to wait in line and overpay.To be fair, this was not the best day to go, perhaps during the week on a normal day it would be ok. There were a lot of moms with baby strollers, screaming kids yelling and running around, scaring the birds so it was not a relaxing day by any means, it was quite disappointing, but again, for families with somewhat disciplined kids I think it would be better for the birds. There are bird shows which were interesting, again I feel bad for the birds, but some of the intelligent parrots and exotic birds that would normally be caged up all day at least get to perform ""tricks"" which may stimulate them and get them out of the cage and flying around. I looked overhead and did not see any netting so I often wonder why they don't just fly away but they are so well trained they seem to feel this is home so who knows if it is better for them in the long run?Upon leaving, the taxi stand line took 40 minutes to get through, so do download an app like Grab or something else (I was told after the fact.)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r709268008-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

The Bird Park has been a highlight of the students on each of these trips to Singapore. A wide variety of birds for viewing and some very close. The Lory Loft was extremely popular with visitors walking over high wire bridges and walkways stretching amongst the trees. The students also found the Bird Park a great retreat from the hustle and bustle of Singapore.

So glad we got the opportunity to see this bird up close, really a highlight of the day. The rest of the park was very good, we walked the whole thing but you can jump on the free tram to get around quicker however it appeared you would miss alot or would have to back track which defeats taking the tram! Lots of different birds to see, I'm not big on watching nature shows but found alot of these birds very rare/unusual that I hadn't seen before (but that could/probably due to my ignorance).

Few food joints are available near the entrance as well as outside. But the show stopper was bird feeding area. We enjoyed this activity the most especially my daughter. Nectars are available at 2 dollars which you can buy and feed the birds. They will come and sit on your hands and eat the nectar. Bird lovers will definitely love it.

Jurong Bird Park,ashishj755,Variety of Birds to see!,40,25-Jul-19,"Jurong Bird Park is a must see place if youa re visiting Singapore. It has an excellent variety of birds, which one doesn't get to see in urban environment. The Parrot Paradise section is the best. It has at least 15-20 different variety of parrots/ macau birds.The entire park can be covered in 4-5 hours easily on foot. For senior citizens there is a tram, which takes the tourist around the park and stops at different sections. Tram ticket is extra.First thing you should after entering the park is find out the show timings. There are 2 main bird shows - Pool Amphitheater Bird Show and High Flyers show (currently being shown). Both these shows are excellent and if you are travelling with small children, they will simply love it.Once you note the timings, you can plan your movement inside the park accordingly and cover all the sections by keeping the show timings and location map in mind.In certain sections, the birds are much free inside the large area and you can actually touch them, feed them etc. while larger birds such as different macaus, hornbills are in large cage like areas. There are few live demonstrations also conducted with some real birds, which are handled by the trained park staff.Overall a truly enjoyable bird park visit, worth the money.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r692581771-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,BPE_Sydney,Great park,40,24-Jul-19,"Recently visited with my two kids 7&5. Bought as part of 4 park pass. It's a little far from the city but we had a great day. Loved that you could see the animals from the tram. We were advised to do a full lap in the tram by a friend and that's what we did. We then went back to the animals we wanted to see more closely. The park has a nice kids water play area - recommend that they have a supervisor at all times as some parents were not watching their kids. The shows were the highlight of our visit. They were fantastic and the people who ran them were great. Very clear speakers, easy to understand and very entertaining.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r692218207-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Karrot K,Peaceful and quiet - but some parts need better maintanence,40,31-May-19,"Compared to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, Jurong Bird Park is a much more peaceful trip, where more time can be spent watching the birds and getting up close. However, some parts of the park seem to require maintenance or upgrading, such as the penguin enclosure. The temperature seemed too warm for the enclosure and the enclosure itself, including the glass, seem dirty and not well looked after. I still don't see why such majestic penguins like the Emperor penguin should even be here in Singapore!Overall, the other bird enclosures were decent. However, I don't think I will patronise it again. I'd rather the birds of prey and other large birds be released into the wilderness.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/08/6a/0d/karrot1202.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r677734447-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Waterfall aviary and birds/peacocks freely flying. We had to quietly go near them for a pic. Some would coolly pose for a pic and some would turn their face around and some flew away!

We watched and enjoyed the High Flyers show, especially the parrot singing in three languages! The monorail is long gone ,and I would agree with other reviewers who say the tram stops are in odd locations, not very convenient to main attractions. We loved the flamingos, hornbills and the Lory Loft, but not very much to see in the Waterfall Aviary.

This time, we were surprised how much trees and bushes had grown ad how the park was reshuffled. It is nice to make the train trip once around the area - but there is not much to see as far as birds are concerned. We must admit that we did not attend any performance - we just visited the different sections of the park.It is nice that the bus stops in front of the Park upon arrival - but return to town is a little tricky although logical (one-way roads). We saw beautiful birds although the green is dominating. The Park is. recommendable for people without foot problems - the little train is of some help but not too much.

Jurong Bird Park,JJ E,GREAT BIRD ZOO AND A MUST SEE.,40,24-Feb-19,"24 Feb, 2019 we went to the Jurong Bird Zoo., Singapore. The first thing we found out that the discounted seniors price advertised only applies to Singapore residents all other countries pay full price.We paid the extra five dollars for the tram ride. At station one we were told to take a seat because we are disabled. We waited for ages and still told to take a seat. After waiting for a long time we got up and walked off. They ignored us.The bird show happens twice a day and we watched that. A show not to be missed. Very well done.The park is well set out and if you can get the tram to high spots and walk back down looking at all the enclosures. There are shops and food outlets around the park and plenty of rest rooms/toilets around the park.They also have water bottle refill stations at the tram stops.There are a vast number of birds on display and in the middle a fantastic water park for the children. Bring their costumes and towels.The walk in enclosures gets you up and close to the birds.It takes about 4 hours to see it all and well worth it.Bus tours turn up in the morning but they are gone by lunch time.In 2020 the park allegedly moves to the Singapore Zoo we were told.A special thanks to Annie in the shop at the Kids Water Park and Sun Win who works with her.

Jurong Bird Park,JPStarr,Nice Bird Park,40,23-Feb-19,The Jurong Bird Park is on a hillside in the northwestern part of Singapore.

Glad we did as it really wasn't expensive by taxi and an awful lot cooler!The park is amazing 'ì hundreds of varieties of birds from all over the world, many of which are critically endangered or on the verge of extinction in their natural habitats. Be warned it is huge, with some 'must sees' too 'ì ours were the waterfall aviary, wings of Asia and parrot paradise, but we are slightly biased as we are hyacinth macaw fans!The High Flyers show was great although we were very concerned as to the number of group tours there, but they seemed to 'disappear' after the show so guess they were on a 'whirlwind tour' of Singapore which included a couple of hours here.We took our time 'ì we are animal and bird enthusiasts 'ì we sat regularly and also drank plenty as it got hotter as the day went on.

Jurong Bird Park,alwsempl,Tired,40,2-Feb-19,"When we visited the zoo night safari we learnt that the bird park is to be shifted to the same site as the zoo. This could explain the fact that we felt there was information lacking at the bird park. That said the bird park is still wort the time. getting there is no more difficult that the zoo though the bus connection at the train stop is not quite so obvious. The entry way with its arch of orchids is truly impressive. The lay out is not quite as efficient as the night safari at the zoo and we found we did some doubling back at times. We saw some spectacular birds and the bird show we saw was quite excellent. What disappointed us was that, at times, there was no information about the origin of these birds. Generally the huge walk in aviaries had notice boards that helped identify the birds within and we found ourselves trotting back and forth to do just that. But, at times we had no idea which countries were the natural habitat of these great.creatures. In one aviary we met an attendant willing to talk and we had a very informative conversation about the birds close by. We are anticipating that, when this bird park is to be relocated and when it is, the new venue will address the issue we encountered.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r649568616-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,Liew S,Bird Eye Tour,40,28-Jan-19,"We always visit the Jurong Bird Park at least 4-5 times a year as our Son, Denver is a bird fanatic. This year we are very happy that they have a Bird Eye Tour where we get to see special behind the scenes. Upon our arrival, it was raining and Grace , our tour guide was very nice to reschedule us a new date but the weather suddenly clears up and the dark skies went away and we are so happy that Grace said we could still carry on with the tour. Grace is very welcoming and heart warming and Denver got really comfortable with her quickly and they both chatted away taking about the different kinds of birds and Grace was so patient with Denver's queries, answering each of them with love. It was a memorable experience and we got to get up close with some of Denver's favourite birds like the Hornbill, Hawk, Vulture and Owl. We even got to see a baby owl that was one month old at the time of our visit and it was so cute and fluffy. We loved and enjoyed the interactions and feeding sessions with Sally the Hornbill and the Hawks. Birds are actually very intelligent and very interactive and it's actually really fun and exciting for young children. Even my one and a half year old Daughter enjoyed her bird Eye Tour experience. Highly recommended and If you happen to have Grace as your tour guide, it's your lucky day cos she's such a sweetheart and she's really good with children.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r648663142-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,enidsera,Realistic Forest Experience,40,23-Jan-19,"Jurong Bird Park is mostly made up of large glasshouse-like habitats. In some, you can walk through the habitats and see the birds in the various enclosures.

It's great to be able to see most of the birds up close with the open enclosures for some.At the Lory feeding area, there is a large suspension bridge that is great for walking and taking pictures.There are also bird shows conducted at various areas in the park.Food choices are very simple as compared to other wildlife attractions in Singapore.The large playground and waterplay area is great for kids and looks to be a newer developed section of the park. There is a place to eat as well as a store that sells gear and accessories required for waterplay.It would be good to see how the park is revamped once they have moved to Mandai.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0e/a8/f6/6a/enidsera.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r647701299-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

We spent about 2.5 hrs here, could easily have spent another 2 hours or so. The place has a few steepish hills that I found a little difficult but there were plenty of seats available to give the knees a rest, also there is a ""train"" system operating around the park. I would suggest a full circuit on this to get your bearings to what you want to see, timings and distances for the shows that are on offer. The waterfall enclosure was spectacular although you really have to search for the birds here. In the other enclosures most of the birds were accustomed to people so were not that skittish, therefore great photos. The big disappointment was the 1"" square heavy wire mess frontage to some of the cages - some cages had large plexiglass panels which permitted better photography. I watched the ""parrot"" show which was very good and permitted you to get up close for the good photos, unfortunately I missed the raptor show.Please note that this sanctuary is being relocated in the near future to the same area as the zoo, I was assured the new location has much better housing for the birds and better photographic opportunities.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r639178662-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Rayn72,Beautiful bird park - perfect family outing,40,5-Dec-18,"Jurong bird park is an ideal half day trip, preferably made with family or friends. It has a huge collection of birds, beautifully housed in various landscapes.Firstly, buy the tickets beforehand in order to avoid waiting in the queue.Carry an umbrella/ poncho, a bottle of water (which you can refill in the park) and a camera.If you prefer walking and spending time seeing birds, you can give up the tram ride though the tram gives you the option of spending how much ever time you wish between the pick up points.We walked from stations 1 to 3 at leisure and got to see and interact with many birds. The African waterfall is beautifully landscaped and even smells like a deep tropical forest.The parrot show is awesome and so is the lunch served with it, along with a lovely view of the flamingos. We didn't get to see the other shows though.One of the best bird parks I have been to.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/12/82/12/73/rayn72.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r637560169-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Bethany M,Good but not amazing,40,29-Nov-18,I did enjoy this park and there was some lovely birds but there's just something not right about seeing them caged up! At the back of the park is a big cage that you can walk inside which was really awesome! I'd read up on a few reviews for the bird park and zoo to see how long it would take and most was saying you can do both in one day! Well you really can't and we had to cut the bird park short by about half of it to get to the zoo in time. If you want to see everything properly I'd day you could easy spend the whole day at the bird park then do the zoo on a different day. If you do want to do both in one day it is doable but you need to get there for when it opens!,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r636403386-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Most of them are in a natural environment except maybe for the penguins. I especially enjoyed the birds of paradise, penguins, giant macaws, pelicans, toucans, and the bird shows. The better places to eat are outside the entrance.

Jurong Bird Park,roamer70,fascinating,40,25-Nov-18,"The highlight to any visit to the Bird Park is the essentially ""circus"" show put on by the birds and trainers that demonstrates the intelligence level of at least some of the birds. The heart of the Park however are the features aside from the show. The wide range of species in their habitat are fascinating but because the birds are held in ample caged areas well supplied with vegetation it is at times difficult to locate the individuals that are housed in a given cage. However taking the time to spot them is rewarding. There is also a small railroad service that can be taken from major location to location that is especially handy for families with small children or the aged like myself.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r635445725-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,WaxenWings,Exotic Birds You Might Never Get to See Lest You Get to Travel the World,40,24-Nov-18,"The bird park gives you access to the colourful birds of varying sizes from exotic places and those endemic in the Asian region. There are shows inside the park, which you should catch, so take note of their timings. We got to watch the ""High Flyers Show"" on the Pools Amphitheatre which is near the entrance. It showcases the colourful high flying macaws from Africa, which was awesome! Next show we got into was the Birds of Prey, which featured humongous vultures! When buying tickets, you get to purchase an add-on for the tram, which allows you breeze through different stations in the park instead of walking. Although walking would be great of your health, trekking the park might not be advisable in the sweltering heat of the Singapore tropical weather. We started late in the afternoon, so we only were able to visit about 60% of park. So it might be best to start early to be able to enjoy the whole park. I heard they're moving the park to a new location (nearer to the Singapore Zoo and to the Night Safari), so that might provide a different experience overall. We visited the park because our toddler loves birds, and living in the city-state that is Singapore, you don't really have the chance to seeing exotic birds apart from those endemic in the island country.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r635236633-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,BrandonPBS,The Feathered Ones at Jurong Bird Park,40,5-Nov-18,"It will move by 2020 to a new location as part of the Eco-tourism Hub in Mandai, joining the Singapore Zoological Gardens, River Safari and the Night Safari with a host of other new developments.I don't remember the first time I visited but the last outing in 2015 was memorable as the trip was made with some 30 elderly persons on a company-organized outing community involvement event. This time, I had the pleasure of strolling through the park to see what I might have missed in the last visit 'ì afterall, that trip was a 'working trip'ù.The 2 bird shows remained the key highlights. The 'Kings of the Skies'ù at the Hawk Arena was an awesome display of birds of prey 'ì the hunting skills, the sharp eyes, the majestic flights. The 'High Flyers'ù at the Amphitheater has always been a treat with the colors of the bird on display, the interaction with the audience, the intelligence of this feathered ones. The finale of birds at the end of the show was still a sight to behold, I remembered there were more birds and colours many years back.Built on a bowl-shaped valley, Lory Loft (another highlight) offered a two-tiered feeding tower that reached right into the middle of the aviary with a 360-degree view of the area. But where were the lories and lorikeets hiding when I visited? Perhaps taking an afternoon nap after a morning of hard work? I remember the colourful experience the elderlies had in my last visit when many more of these beautiful winged creatures would feed off the hand-held cups of fascinated visitors young and old. How often you have birds perching on your arm or shoulder, feeding off your hand?The waterfall aviary was another favourite. Towering at a height equivalent to 13 storeys, it houses one of the world's tallest man-made, indoor waterfalls. The crashing sounds of water, the panoramic view of the landscape from the suspended bridge, the close encounters with Guinea fowls along the trails, the myriad of birds fluttering and perching on the trees, and the sight of the some of the more reticent birds in action. This aviary is a walk-in paradise.There were some more attractions 'ì the Pelican Cove, The Flamingo Lake, The Flamingo Pool, another walk-through segmented aviary where you can catch a glimpse of the birds of paradise'¶ and there is the newest attraction which is the Parrot Paradise near where the Swan Lake is. Well, I would have preferred a walk-in experience but the parrots were caged exhibits. Maybe they needed to prevent bird escapes.For the young ones, there is a playground and small water park where they can have fun while the adults take a break from the walking. Another nice cool place to hide away would be the viewing gallery within the Penguin enclosure where visitors can enjoy the tranquillity in a cool darkened environment, resting your aching legs in full sight of a colony of aquatic flightless birds from the south-pole with occasional dive-in spectacles.The Jurong Birdpark will be missed and I will be planning a couple more trips before the move to Mandai in a couple of years or so. At the same time, I am looking forward to a grand new home for The Feathered Ones.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r630841632-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

We took a bus from the Jurong Point Mall here as there is no direct MRT connectivity. The park is huge in size and you have different sections for each kind of birds. We really enjoyed the bird show which was spectacular especially the Hornbills and the parrots part.Do choose the Tram ride (especially on a sunny day) which gives you a quick ride around the park.

Jurong Bird Park,Odyssey820079,Great day out with nature,40,30-Sep-18,"The Bird Park exceeded our expectations, and the web site doesn't quite explain it in a clear fashion. We really loved the large aviaries...seeing birds in their natural environment. Taking some time to watch, wait, and see what emerged gave us a much better experience than those who just rolled around on the tram (and paid more to do so). Wild birds (eg stork-billed kingfisher) also came to the park to add to the excellent displays.The shows were OK - a little bit 'touristy'ù for me (but go to the Hawk Conservancy at Andover UK for really great displays where the birds perform as nature intended).We walked round the whole park, took around 5 hours, and avoided the over-priced restaurants. Had an awful coffee at $5 a cup and then it was full of sugar (beware - this is the local custom), but this didn't detract from a great day. Had some cute lizards thrown in ... great pics of a lizard in the flamingoes' drinking trough. Memorable and would do it again.Just hope they can transition to the new site in 2020 and keep the natural areas working in the same way.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r620636729-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,AbhimanyuSinghi,Bird Lover's Paradise,40,19-Sep-18,"If you are happy to walk then there is so much to explore in the Jurong Bird Park that half a day vanishes in the blink of an eye and you are left lamenting all that you have missed out on. Even though we were there with our 3 year old son we still covered most parts of the park. The varieties of birds is immense and the resplendent colours a joy for the viewer.In half a day we could manage only one of the two shows and two feedings. the penguin feeding turned out to be a dud for us as we are vegetarians and couldn't get around to feeding fish to the penguins with our hands. The lory feeding was much more fun. For SGD 3 you get a small glass of nectar to feed the birds. The lory loft has various levels and criss cross wooden bridges which itself give you an adventure feel. The birds hardly have any nectar - in fact you will find it difficult to finish even half the glass. But they hop on to your hands, shoulders, head and that itself is so much fun. A pair of lories stuck to my head for a good 7-8 minutes before my child shooed them away forcibly.The Waterfall Aviary was the best area of the lot as you could walk around freely with the birds. My son chased quite a few of them and in general had an amazing time looking for birds hidden in bushes.The entire park is well planned out though they could have avoided some of the uphill walking. Most enclosures and the birds in them are beautiful especially the penguins and the pelicans. Would recommend at least half a day here and even more if you intend to walk around with little children.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/04/53/35/abhimanyu-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r617910310-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,DizzyBlonde23,Nice bird park,40,16-Sep-18,Sorry for late review as visited in May 2017.Do not usually visit zoos etc etc as don't agree with most of them but as this was touted as free flying with a large variety of birds thought we would visit.The park is vast with a lot of free flying aviaries where we could feed the birds which was nice to do. The whole park is very natural looking and most of the birds looked well and happy although we did find one or two cages a little smallWent to a number of the shows throughout the day which we found informative and fun.Would recommend visiting whilst in Singapore although if only there one or two days would not go out of my way.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0f/90/27/6c/dizzyblonde23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r616888452-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

I mean it's just the birds what else....! with these thoughts I landed here. To my surprise, it was far beyond my expectations.... too good.. :). It took 30 Minutes for me to get there by taxi from Park Royal Hotel on Kitchener. Once in, I moved around a little bit and found that there is a High Flyers show at 11AM (it repeats at 3PM) at Pools Amphitheatre. This is one of the best (highly recommended) its a 30 Min show ends at 11.30 and you get to see almost all the exotic birds.One more recommendation, please bring cart for kids if possible. they provide electric scooters as well on rent. it will be a long walk. you can always hop on to the trams (Chargeable) but its worth it (for little heavy ppl like me :) ).In the end I would rate it to be amongst top 10 places to visit in Singapore if you are on a family trip..

Jurong Bird Park,schreiby,A fun day out!,40,2-Aug-18,"Having lived in Singapore for over 3 years I thought it was high time to visit the Jurong Bird Park. My mother was visiting from Australia and she loves birds so thought we would venture out. We caught the train out and then connected to a bus which took us straight there (so easy)! I wanted to get there for the bird shows, the first one started at 10am and the next was at 11am. The first one was Kings of the Skies which was teaching you about Hawks and Vultures - excellent show! The second was probably more amusing which was High Flyers. We also went through the Lorry Lorikeet section where the birds were very friendly and would crawl onto your hands and shoulders. I was actually surprised at how big the complex was and there was certainly lots to see. It is a fair walk to get around all the park so suggest you buy a ticket for the train. Singapore does these attractions so well! Recommend a visit if you have an interest in birds but definitely make it for the shows.

Jurong Bird Park,Divit B,The shows are definitely worth a watch,40,28-Jul-18,"The birds here are amazing. The bird park is very well maintained. Try avoiding the rainy season as the bird shows can get canclled. The highlight is definitely the bird shows. Also a small note flamingos stink alot. I couldn't even stand the smell from 10 feet away the enclosure area. Another place you should definitely visit is the Lori aviary where you can feed the birds while they sit on your hands, a small 3$ price tag for the feeding. They only come on your hand if they are hungry",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r600423179-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,pete p,A good day out,40,28-Jul-18,"Really easy to get to, catch a bus from the MRT station and it stops right outside (you can use your SMRT tourist card on these busses) include a tram ticket with your entry tickets, hopping on and off the tram can save you a lot of walking on a hot day. We found some of the caged birds a bit hard to see but the aviary is the star, you get to wander around in the forest wilt the birds flying around you. The park is very well laid out, beautiful waterfall and streams. Watch out for the pelicans in the trees above your head....we just missed a bird poo shower really interesting birds of prey show, some huge birds and audience participation. Getting back to town is really easy, the bus back to the MRT stops on the opposite side of the highway (use the underpass).

Jurong Bird Park,Chris P,"Great place to visit, but allow a day",40,24-Jul-18,"The bird park is a long ride on metro and then a bus ride to the park.But the lory loft was worth it. You can buy lory feed and the birds in the huge aviary swoop down to feed from your hand- a great experience.Some of the cages seem a bit small but most are designed with bird's requirements in mind.I would have appreciated some rest areas with shade/cover to help with the relentless heat, but as it outdoor park, not much else can be done.Buy tickets on line for 10% discount",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r599124490-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Paul P,Birds & tropical forest in the city,40,22-Jul-18,"A recommended place to visit in Singapore city for nature lovers. Experience tropical forest atmosphere with birds flying around you. I visited this park 20 years ago, and this infrastructures although showed signs of its age, seemed to be well maintained. Vegetation has grown considerably but I could only see 2 paradise birds and the Macau numbers seemed to be much less than decades ago. The Macaus used to be put on display outside without cage but now are confined.But I like the embedded educational messages during the bird shows that teach awareness of the dwindling habitat for animal in the wild.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r598308319-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Carol W,Family experience of birds in natural surroundings,40,12-Jul-18,"This is a pleasant, family orientated bird park with many varieties of birds in large aviaries. There is a canopied hop on- hop off train on wheels to convey people around the park at a low cost. The pathways are wide and suitable for wheelchairs and the unsteady but there are inclines which could make pushing strollers or wheelchairs hot work. Bring an umbrella, a water bottle, a sunhat and a camera.Bird feeding is a fun experience in The Loft which is at train station one. The Waterfall requires more careful supervision of family members as there are some obstacles and ponds.

He provided me with a personal tour of the park for the day! Lucas wants to be a zoologist & I believe he will make a fabulous one!

Jurong Bird Park,ahying84,Good weather plays an important part!,40,26-Jun-18,"It was an awesome weather with not much sun, slight drizzle which lasted only few mins. Cooling.. on the signboards says on weekends there's show at 130pm (can't rmb exact time) at Birds of Asia, we were there but See no show..Went to Lory Loft where we donated $3 to buy nectar water to feed the birds, staff on duty were very honest to let us know that it's either there's not many birds around or the birds were fully fed, but we still go ahead.. managed to feed a few birds. Water playground was very much enjoyable for th kids.. they enjoyed themselves very much. There's a nice air-conditioned room with cushions for adults to rest while the kids play.. toilets were clean, just that there is no water heater for shower and the kids were shivering with lips turning purple.. (ceiling Fans were blowing directly over head)The bad experience was at the photo booth, by digi photos, my friend was excited to see his photo on the screen and wanted to snap a photo. Instead of telling him not to do so, a rude staff on duty by the name of, Fatin, hit his hand away! Is that what a customer service crew at places of interest should behave? Yes, my friend may be in the wrong to try taking a photo, but she could have polite ask him not to do so, and if he did, ask him to delete the photo. She should not use physical action. My friend was nice enough to smile at her.. when I approached her to check out what had happened (my sis witnessed the scene and informed me), Fatin was rude and defended herself aggressively! Throwing her belongings into the cupboard unhappily, banging things here and there. I believe she called her superior who came shortly and approached me. He explained to me about her personal issue, apologised on behalf and gave us a card to access the photo online. Logan was professional in handling the situation.Fatin is definitely not suitable for this line if she continues behaving like this. Before this incident, I saw that she was impatient with a group of Korean tourists too.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r590739360-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

I know they are moving from here to the zoo are, so everything is under one roof but that is not till 2020. Don't get me wrong, it is a great day out, there is lots to see. I'm not a fan of the live shows, if you have seen the shows in USA then this is nothing compared to them, but nevertheless, it is worth seeing them. We did not initially take the tram, instead following the map seeing all that there was. The aviary is awesome, buy some food for the birdies and they'll come and sit and eat, it was very nice experience. Once we walked the park, we then took a trip round the park on the tram to see if we had missed anything.There is a shuttle bus that goes to the zoo area but this is only on the hour, so we instead had to get a taxi.Overall, a great day out with lots to see.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/c0/d7/23/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r588244772-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,svyr14,Jurong Bird Park,40,15-Jun-18,"The place was really nice and big and there were many exhibits to explore. I always loved to come here ever since I went as a small kid even though I don't live in Singapore. Many of the birds could be spotted, if you just try hard enough to look for them. Unfortunately a part of the birds of prey exhibit was under renovation when I visited with my friends and that was a bit of a shame. Nevertheless, there are still many cool birds to see. The Lory Loft was crowded and very few lories came to feed from our bird food cup so that was kind of a downer (granted we did come on Vesak Day). They were probably all well-fed already by the previous visitors; we came there around past noon. We had wanted to go to the Waterfall Aviary as well since that was like the main attraction for us but unfortunately again, it rained very hard and we couldn't enjoy that part of the trip. Me and my friend just went and ran into the rain anyways though hahaha. Could be nice for atmospheric rainy shots too near the waterfall which was a very nice scene even in the pouring rain. My tip for visiting here? Definitely go with friends and family, that always makes thing a whole lot more fun. Check the weather forecast first, sunny to cloudy days are the best and you should avoid rain when going here at all costs. The place is pretty big so we did do a hefty amount of walking but if you're used to that, the park will be no problem. If not, you can get a park train ticket for $4 or $5 per adult I'm not sure I forgot. The layout of the place is very convenient as well, it's pretty much a big circle and you'll visit all exhibits by going one round around it which is neat. Food and beverage wise? Those weren't our top priority when visiting because we were too fixated on the awesome birds haha. There are water refill stations around the place and vending machines which is nice. Not a whole lot of food areas scattered around though, they're mostly situated near the entrance. But at least that keeps the park clean too! Check out their website as well it has many useful information!

Jurong Bird Park,ashwinj235,Amazing bird show that will give you goose bumbs,40,5-Jun-18,"Went to Singapore for a holiday and going to bird park was on our list.... Since day 1 of reaching Singapore, my lil one wanted to visit this place...Finally on 3rd day of our trip we went to Jurong bird park.... Took a cab to reach this place as it was the most convenient option... No direct metro service was available and we had to shift from metro to a bus after reaching a point... Didn't want to do any sort of adventure so took a cab...Reached this place around 2pm.... I would recommend people to visit much earlier... As soon as you enter there are people who will take a family snap with birds on your hand... Sounded like fun so went for it. It was a rip off... One picture they charge 30SHD... Also they will block your view so that nobody can click with their personal camera.There are 2 ways of visiting this place... One you can walk around or take a bus trip. We took the bus trip which lasted for 20mins and didn't get to see any birds properly... Visiting this place by feet is the best option....Now coming back to the bird park... You will get to see some amazing birds that you would have never heard of... They have maintained the place so well. The best part of Jurong is their bird shows... It happens every alternate hour. So plan your visit in such a way that you will cover most bird shows... It's incredible to see how well the birds are trained and how the performers keep the audience glued to their seats... The best thing to do in Jurong is to watch the bird shows... Adults and kids both will have super time",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r585235418-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Buzz2020,Natural Tropical Geaway,40,27-May-18,I spent two hours at the bird park on a hot Sunday afternoon and was amazed at the diversity of wildlife. For a few extra dollars you can ride the tram about a 30 minute excursion through the park which let you see the highlights follow that with a walk to see more of the hidden gems here.

Jurong Bird Park,WaterEnthusiasts,interesting and informative,40,25-May-18,"We certainly saw a lot of birds, colorful and beautiful. It was nice to have a chance to really see the local birds up close, and think about how they differ from their cousins in other parts of the world. We also saw a lot of local vegetation, which was a nice opportunity as so much of Singapore is developed and paved. I share the mixed feelings that many people have about animals in captivity, on display. To my untrained eye, this seemed humane and the habitat seemed pretty authentic. It had a similar vibe to the San Diego Zoo. The infrastructure for human visitors was nicely maintained, and the personnel were friendly.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r582523940-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Brunks2011,Great shows and a lot of birds - hire a electric wheelchair,40,12-May-18,"A great place to visit which takes between 2 to 3 hours to see properly. Many magnificent and varying types of birds with good interaction with visitors. Get there early as can get crowded later in the day - opens at 8.30am which would be a good time to arrive. Cost is Sg$30 + $5 for the train. As a lot of walking is involved, I would recommend hiring an electric wheelchair for $20. Taxis turn up often for departing also a van service (10 seater) is available outside near taxi rank for $50 anywhere in Singapore - good value for families and no wait for a taxi.

Jurong Bird Park,Aditya V,Must visit in Singapore,40,5-May-18,"Wonderful Bird park. Takes 3 hours to see the place in its entirety. Check the timings of certain activities to make the most of your visit. The park encompasses a huge area and the variety / collection of species is great, but not as much as Bali Bird Park. Also, at Bali Bird Park, you can take pictures with the birds for free, but over here you need to pay to have a picture taken with the birds. However, the bird research lab at Jurong is really educational and gives good insight into the efforts put in by the team there. As per your liking, this park is suitable for families, friends or even solo persons.

Jurong Bird Park,ChinT220361,Take a taxi,40,1-May-18,"The park is some way from the centre. You can do the MRT / Bus option (according to other TA reviewers) but we chose taxi and had no regrets. About 30 minutes from Orchard road and not expensive at all. Finding a return cab from the Park also proved straightforward.Entrance fees are reasonable - helped by a discount offered if you flew with Singapore Airlines. Don't waste your money on the bus unless you are physically unable to walk, it really is not too challenging to walk the park, even in the heat.Park itself is excellent, lots to see and do. Feeding the parrots was the highlight for our kids, they really do come and sit on your arm for a shot of glucose.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/10/f0/1f/f6/chint220361.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r576882470-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,rahuldawda,An afternoon well spent with the birds,40,29-Apr-18,"Situated in Jurong Hill, the Jurong Bird Park is rather far away compared to the other animal parks in Mandai. We took the MRT to Boon Lay and then transfer by bus 194 which dropped us off right next to the bird park. We opted against having lunch with the birds at the park after reading quite a few disappointing reviews about others' experiences and arrived late in the afternoon not knowing what to expect. We had purchased the Park Hopper ticket and so had the tram rides free (for which we thanked our stars since it raining a bit). The park isn't too big and especially with the trams, it can be covered in about 2-3 hours. The park has a good variety of birds and kids would have surely have a great time there.Our best memory at the park was the waterfall aviary. The sound of water crashing against the rocks along with birds chirping away in the background was incredible. It is also a great spot for photography. We spent quite a bit of our time here. Our biggest disappointment would have to be the canceled eagle show at the amphitheater due to rainfall. Alas, there's nothing one can do about that. Nonetheless, it was 3 hours well spent.A note for those using public transport to commute from the park. The bus stop for Boon Lay is on the other side of the road and is not easily detectable. You'll have to cross the under bridge to get there.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r576416017-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,sarah L,Educational and relaxing family outing,40,28-Apr-18,"My 2 sons and I enjoyed a very informative, yet relaxing outing to the park. I had never thought of going to the bird park, but a visiting friend went there and recommended I take my children, aged 10 and 12. I am glad that I did. We saw so many interesting birds and there was a lot of information, but it was not overwhelming. You can wander around the park or take a tram and get off at the different stops. There is a lot of shade to relax in and multiple places to stop and relax. The only reason that I have not given it a 5/5 is because I think the food choices could be improved on. I understand the bird park is to move nearer the zoo, which I think will be a great improvement and hopefully with the move will come associated healthier meal options. A highly recommended outing in Singapore.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r576237678-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,martynr164,Cut short by an afternoon thunderstorm,40,26-Apr-18,"We traveled from the city on the EW line to Boon lay then transfered to bus No194 which took us directly to the park. On buying our tickets I showed our Singapore airline boarding passes & although we could not get a discount on our tickets the tram ride was free. We arrived at the park around 12.30 in the afternoon planning to tour the park then do the 15.00 &16.00 shows. Firstly we took the tram to Lory Loft to see the Toucans & hornbills. Next we took the tram to the waterfall Aviary. I fell in love with this place, so tranquil with the sound of water splashing & birds singing in the trees. We spent a lot of time here (more than an hour) so we had to miss the last stop to get back in time for the High flyers show at 15.00. As we sat down we could hear the thunder in the distance. The show started at 15.00, but within 5 minutes the heavens opened & there was a torrential downpour, every one ran for cover & I must give the park staff a round of applause for trying to carry on with the show from under the tent, but in the end they had to cancel the show for safety reasons. The noise of the rain on the Canopy was horrendous. Stopped at the Penguin exhibit as it was inside but the rain did not stop & so the kings of the skies show was also cancelled. Stopped for a bite to eat at the Hawk cafe on the way out hoping the rain would stop but it just kept on coming. Luckily the bus stop wasn't to far & we made a quick dash.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/3f/ce/b7/martynr164.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r575850924-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,AbyBaldota,The Shows @ Jurong amaze you and the Park is Entertaining,40,23-Apr-18,The Jurong Bird Park is conceived very well and it is like no other Bird Park in Asia. Very well maintained and is worth a visit with your family.The shows that they have will truly blow your mind and is a fun activity to do while you are in the park. Dont miss the shows and plan your walk around the park accordingly.You would need 3-5 hours in the park to really cover all the zones and see the shows along the route.Food in the park isn't great and you must consider carrying some basic food. Particularly Vegetarians.Elderly will find it difficult to walk and should opt for the electric carts. Call Jurong Bird Park before you book for senior citizens and ensure they are comfortable.Hope this helps.Cheers -Aby Baldota,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/ef/5d/1c/abybaldota.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r575160927-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Our team members were made up of mostly seniors (above 60 years old). We were very grateful to the staff for their considerations and accommodation!Visually captivating - our seniors were liven up by the vibrant colours, vast variety of birds and their flights also energized them! Most of them had not visited the Jurong Bird Park for more than 10 years. It was reminiscing and they did a walk down the memory lane.Inclusive - We also noticed that the multi-lingual introduction panels at Lory Loft included Braille for the visually-impaired visitors. There are regular tram services and gradual slopes to facilitate mobility.Our seniors were happy with the team bonding session carried out and created a lot more happy memories at the Hanging Bridge, Waterfall Aviary and Heliconia Walk.

I would like to walk through a covered area into a massive bird of prey area.I am opposed to the concept of caged animals and for the most part was impressed with this park with the exception of the birds of prey.

After the metro, walk 100m through the mall ( just follow the signs) get the bus 2 stops to the park. There was a little train going through the park for $3. You can get on and off at any of the 3 stops. Worth every penny. The bird park itself was ok but it wasn't top of my list of things to do. The indoor waterfall was lovely and the general walk around very nice too. The blue macaws were my favourite as I hadn't seen them before. At Lori loft I saw 2 little birds only.

Usually the shows will be done once in the morning and once again in the afternoon. So plan the time accordingly. If you want to walk slowly and enjoy the day in nature you can comfortably spend a day in this park. The climate will be more humid so go with the comfortable outfits and water bottle. Drinking water point is available at many locations where you can fill your bottle. The park keepers are very friendly and I'm sure you'll enjoy your trip.

The penguins and many types of hornbill were a particular highlight for all of us. However it is very difficult to get a stroller around unless u just follow the road.

It is looking a bit tired in places but a nice way to spend a few hours. The birds are beautiful and it great to be able to go into the Lori Loft and have the birds land on you and feed from a small cup of bird food that you can purchase. There are a few places to eat and a gift shop. If you can ride the small tram and hop on and off at the exhibits.

Jurong Bird Park,awayagainBen,Allow plenty of time.,40,17-Feb-18,"After a journey of just over an hour using the MRT and then a bus we arrived at the bird park. We opted to use the tram as we didn't have a great deal of time but we would have been quicker walking as we had to queue for 20 minutes to use the tram. (I think the $5 fee to use the tram is a bit steep). It is quite a hilly park so the walk wouldn't suite everyone, especially on a hot day.The park however is lovely with a vast variety of birds, some of which are endangered. It's reassuring to see that the park is working hard towards the conservation of birds like the Macaw and not just opening as a tourist attraction.On leaving we joined the queue for a taxi and waited 30 minutes before it was our turn.

Jurong Bird Park,mcm04999,Interesting way to spend day.,40,11-Feb-18,"As birding people, we went to the Bird Park to see some of the non-captive inhabitants as well as the beautiful captive birds. We came by taxi from Orchard Rd and came after 10 am to avoid the traffic but going back, we were caught up, so try to leave by 3.30 or else use public transport.The flight aviaries are spectacular and the birds easy to see. Some of the identification signage does not include all the birds in that aviary but is mostly good. The birds are beautiful and range from small to large, colourful to fairly plain and very loud to very quiet. I would recommend the Lory Loft, the hornbills and the Waterfall aviary. There are plenty of shelters if it rains and small cafes dotted around the site. If you can't stand the humidity, I would recommend paying a little extra for the tram to get from place to place. The bird show was a bit kitsch for me but others really enjoyed it. The layout is really good and straightforward so there is little backtracking.

Jurong Bird Park,MadhulikaL4,Birds of different feathers flock together,40,1-Feb-18,"One of Singapore's major wildlife parks, the Jurong Bird Park is a must-see if you're at all fond of bird life. Set across many acres of well-wooded landscape, with lots of towering trees, water bodies and aviaries of different types and sizes, the bird park gives you a real bird's eye view of the world's avifauna. A road (flanked on both sides by beautiful heliconia shrubs with vivid red and yellow flowers) marks the route right through the park, and trams travel along these, stopping at designated tram stops along the way to allow hop-on hop-off travel. There are secondary pathways that you can traverse only on foot.Among the most intriguing and spectacular sections we saw were the ones that allow visitors to get up close to the birds: the aviaries where you walk right in. The raptors, hornbills, toucans, birds of paradise, parrots, etc are all in cages (all very large, rest assured), but the pelicans and the flamingoes are out in the open on lakes, and two massive aviaries'îthe Lory Loft (which houses about a thousand lorikeets) and the Waterfall Aviary (the highlight of which is a 35 mt high waterfall)'îallow you to really cross paths with some lovely birds. We oohed and aahed over gorgeous crowned pigeons, brilliantly coloured finches, parrots, macaws, peafowl, and more, watched them feeding just an arm's length away, and got a chance to see many species we'd never even heard about before.One of the most informative sections is the Bird Discovery Centre, a small and compact space that, across a handful of rooms, uses text, pictures, stuffed specimens and more to explain birds: their beaks, their bodies, their feeding and reproduction, human inventions inspired by birds, and more.There is also a children's play area that is bird-themed (we couldn't visit this because, due to some corporate function, the park shut early on the day we visited). There are also various souvenir shops, eateries, toilets, etc dotted across the park. Do remember to pick up a park map and brochure (available free at the entrance), which also includes a comprehensive listing of feeding times for different birds'îit's a good way of getting to see them'îas well as the timings for different shows at the park.The only show we were able to go to was the High Flyers one, which showcases some interesting skills'îflying/manoeuvring, dexterity, vocal mimicry, etc by an array of birds such as parrots, hornbills, and so on. Our toddler, whose fourth birthday it was in the day we visited, was absolutely thrilled that the parrot on the compere's wrist actually sang 'Happy birthday to you' to all those in the audience (including, of course, our daughter) who were celebrating their birthday on that day. The show ended with a delightful grand finale consisting of dozens of birds of different species waddling into the amphitheatre and filling it with sound and colour.We loved this place. The only drawback of it being a rainy day (it drizzled throughout, in varying intensity) was that since about 95% of the birds are out in the open (even the aviaries are covered in the top only by mesh), you get wet if you aren't carrying an umbrella or wearing a raincoat. Either way, taking photos gets a bit difficult.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0b/19/cd/d1/madhulika-l.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r557649503-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Ty E,Love birds? Got to go here!,40,29-Jan-18,"Asia's largest bird park houses 5,000 birds across 400 species. Many of them roam free as we saw birds that were not in their designated signed enclosures. It was sad to see large Birds of Prey in wired cages too small for them but otherwise; it is a well thought out Bird Park. Our favorite was the Waterfall Aviary where we watched a Taveta Golden Weaver painstakingly construct his nest out of foliage and twigs. Another fun bird to watch was the Common Crowned Pigeon who didn't mind us being within a foot of it to take pictures. We could have stayed all day. Make sure to put on bug spray before you go!Take the East-West MRT line bound for Tuas Link, and alight at Boon Lay (EW27).

Jurong Bird Park,ah tee s,Dinosaur descendants,40,28-Jan-18,"I was helping out at a One Community Fiesta event as first aiders and took the opportunity to walk around the Bird Park to have another appreciation of the Park before it moved to Mandai in 2020. This was not the first time I came to this Bird Park. The last two occasions we were fascinated by the bird shows but this time I just walked around quickly to have a glimpse if there is anything different. Frankly speaking, I don;t really have much interest in aviary species and even if they appeared very colorful to me, I don't really will read more about it.But I was surprised to see one section of the park labeled as `Dinosaur Descendants' and include such birds like Emu, ostrich, etc. How does dinosaurs evolved into birds? How does feathers and wings formed in dinosaurs? I was curious and started reading up on this area and found that evidence were found in fossils linking similar bone structure between one type of dinosaurs and birds. Similarity was also found in the evolution of the skull. I really could not believe this theory. But scientists are talking about evolution over millions of years and I thought of Darwin and the evolution of man from apes.As I returned to the main hall of activities and looking out from the glass door, I could see the stunning view of the many beautiful and colorful flamingos playing in the lake. But deep in my mind, I still wondered if these meek and slender flamingos could have evolved from dinosaurs.It is thought provoking this time to visit the Jurong Bird Park and strongly suggest you visit the park before it moved to Mandai in 2020. .",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/16/3a/bc/4d/soh-kien-peng.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r556826923-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Apart from this there is also option to feed birds and penguins if you want.Overall a nice place for family outing!,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/04/8a/7a/54/facebook-avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r547892864-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,rohanpillai1,Great but expected more,40,18-Dec-17,"The place is a bit overrated. Not saying it's bad but it does not live up-to the amount of publicity it gets. There are different types of birds from all around the world, which is not very unique as it is a common feature in most bird sanctuaries. The live shows have a very odd timing so it is not possible to catch all of them. Rest is good. If you have some spare time, do visit it.

However, we did not enjoyed the parrots aviaries section which seemed toosmall and the birds seemed to try to escape by pecking at the cages.The flamingos and pelicans seemed happy and had large areas to roam about.Jurong Park is a good place to visit if you stay in Singapore for a while.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-a/04/07/e4/a8/francoise1947.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r542544056-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,OrchisSaha,Jurong is a Paradise for Bird Lovers,40,8-Nov-17,"We booked the tickets online and therefore, did not have to stand in queue to book our tickets. Unless it is the peak season there hardly is much of a queue, anyway.The upkeep of the park is impeccable. If you do not like walking for long periods of time, the tram ride is strongly recommended. But there has to be a better way to check if everyone availing the tram ride has actually paid for it. The tram driver (who doubles as a conductor), at every stop, will check your ticket.The overall experience was grand and we managed to watch only the Birds of Prey show which was quite enjoyable. The complete experience of the park will consume at least 6 hours of your time.Due to maintenance work one of the exhibits was closed to tourists. As a gesture of goodwill and courtesy, the management could have gone the extra mile and refunded a part of the entry fee to all tourists who visited the park that day.Amidst the concrete jungles of Singapore, Jurong Bird Park is a pleasant sight to the sore eyes.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/95/c0/d1/orchis-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r539289097-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Arriving at Jurong a short walk to the taxi rank were a transport officer opens the car door for passengers.A drive of approx 15 mins and we arrive at the entrance to the Bird Park. First sight is a display with many species of parrots and the opportunity to have a photo taken. Grab a Park map and hop on the tram for a leisurely trip to station 1. Leave the tram and wander through the displays then pick up the tram again to the next station.Outstanding displays although some appeared empty but actually birds were nesting so not visible.We did not do the Australian section, we know our birds but rest of Park is very good, you have the opportunity to get close and personnel with the parrots and feed them, have your photo taken with them.Told that in 5years Bird Park will be located with Singapore Zoo, good idea as both are an island apart.Cab back to Jurong station, MTR back to Navena station and bus back to hotel.

Jurong Bird Park,CzarEmmanuel,Asia's largest bird park,40,1-Oct-17,"Jurong Bird Park is reputed as the largest bird park in Asia, with more than 500 birds of around 400 species, covering a total land area of 20.2 hectares! You'll surely be amazed by the colors and beauty of the birds in the park ... birds of paradise, hawks, flamingos, parrots, emus, swans, penguins, and much much more!Aside from a wonderful display of birds, there are also regular shows in the park (like the High Fliers show, the Kings of the Skies, etc.). You also have a chance to feed some of the birds or have your photos taken with them. If you get hungry, just go to one of the eateries in the park (like Pizza Hut). Lastly, don't forget to visit the Waterfall Aviary (where you'll find a 30-meter high waterfall, said to be the highest man-made waterfall in the world).Jurong Bird Park is fun for both adults and kids. In fact, they have a dry and wet play zone area called the ""Birdz of Play"" for children. For souvenir, drop by the park's gift shop. To get a complete visit of the place, you may take the tram that moves around the entire site. The park is open daily from 8:30 AM to 6:00 PM. You may take a taxi to reach the place, or take the MRT, get off at the Boon Lay station (green line) and take a shuttle bus from there.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/16/00/f8/bb/czaremmanuel.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r528698283-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,inspiredbytravel1,Caring attitude - benchmark for other attractions o/s,40,29-Sep-17,"Firstly I will tell you I am not keen on animal parks for personal reasons. However a day was to be had at the Jurong Bird Park as my significant other wanted to go there and also our child to see the birds as well whilst in Singapore for holidays.The first part of the day was very humid and we spent time walking to see the flamingos, followed by Pelican cove and swan lake We stopped at Waterfall Cafe and whilst I recovered from the steamy day in the cool of the cafe the more energetic went up the stairs to the viewing platform. They told me it was good.I believe we had lunch at Songbird Terrace where our friend and child left us after eating in the a/c little cafe. Not much seating here when very busy. Little shop located at the other end of the rectangular shaped area where cafe located had some good gifts but on the higher side of pricing, but at least I could see the staff were happy and obviously the money would go to the upkeep of the animals health etc. We purchased some stuffed toys to take home with us and give as gift for friend's child at school (she was thrilled with the bird we purchased incidentally). The toys seemed well made.By the time we got around near Window on Paradise, we decided to go back to the main entrance after that as we were near the end, however we made the choice to see the toucans and Hornbills located just to the side of the road/walkway. This proved a difficulty to get back as just before we could walk back to the main cover the skies opened up and it rained heavily. The cover we did find nearly met it's match in terms of water on the ground as the water from the rain was almost torrential! However what an experience to watch the rain come down like that and it was just us there, there was a lot of thunder and lightning but we were safe. After what seemed like a fairly long time we managed to get back to one of the tram stops with an umbrella we had in lighter rain.However we had been going the wrong way on the pathway and would need to go back around the track, virtually around the whole park. However before too long a staff member appeared in a golf cart style vehicle and asked us if we wanted to go back to the entry/exit?! He even apologised for the vehicle not being totally covered up. At this stage I didn't care but it was covered over our heads. In reality as long as it had four wheels and a steering wheel to get us back I didn't mind. I was exhausted from the day as we had walked in the heat which was our own choice as the attractions are fairly close and paved to each other. I asked how much was the lift back to the entry/exit and he said it was at no cost and the park realised that there is not much cover in rain weather. Joseph was the staff member's name and he was extremely polite and friendly to us. I wish to specially commend Joseph in his appearing at just the right moment and his super polite manner. In the end it made a difference to how we felt at the end of the day after being rather exhausted and our child wanting to go back to the hotel.The kind park staff who directed us around the water that had slightly flooded in the pathway to the entry/exit. They made sure we went the right way to get out and that we didn't get lost in my haze of tiredness.Once again the Singaporeans have been very kind and giving. They made us very welcome wherever we went like friends. Thank you Jurong Bird Park and staff.There is a few really good photo opportunities, one is near the Pelican Cove were there is an outdoor gazebo. However take mosquito repellant for around this area or you will get bitten. Especially for small children who may react to the bites.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/82/c4/93/inspiredbytravel1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r528280162-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

It takes too long in transit and I didn't get as much time at the park as I wanted. You should Spend a while there, there is a lot to see and do, the variety of birds is impressive and their enclosures seem elaborate and reasonably natural.Take your time here.

If you take your time, you'll see the smaller birds, the exotic birds, the amazing bird shows.A lot of the park seems to be a bit run down and out of date, undergoing maintenance and the like.

Jurong Bird Park,chonga400,Educational and entertaining,40,2-Aug-17,The bird park is rather old but has undergone upgrading. It Long history also means that there is a very capable team of Trainers and Presenters for the bird shows. I would recommend spending at least 5 hours between 10:30-3:30 at the park. This way you can catch both shows at 11am and 3pm. The shows features small birds as well as birds of prey. In between bring your kids to the water park and be thrilled and cool down in hot and humid Singapore. Admission to the water park is free. Take a tram ride and you must stop at the aviary and macaws enclosure.

Jurong Bird Park,The_Coach55,Good for Families,40,1-Aug-17,"To get to the bird park, take the MRT to Boon Lay then bus 194 which drops you outside.It's quite a large park with a large number of birds from all over the world, although primarily tropical zones.I enjoyed the flamingoes, macaws, birds of paradise and also the Andean condor. There is a breeding programme here for rare species as well as displays for younger visitors.It's more geared up for families with fast food outlets and play areas. I paid SIN$29 for admission plus an extra $5 for the tram which I did not use.However, the far side of the park is fairly hilly and anyone with mobility issues would be best using the tram.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/36/af/94/the-coach55.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r507636249-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,820gyuri,Jungle in a concrete jungle...,40,9-Jul-17,"Juring Bird Park is a wonderful place to visit. Hundreds of bird species can be viewed here. There are some shows too, demonstrating the natural abilities of birds. You can have great photos taken (for a charge) with the park's famous large parrot collection or if you like, you can feed the birds ( with birdfood sold in the park). There are adequate signage everywhere and they help to identify the birds and learn some of their habits. Some birds could fly away if they would want to, but instead they hang around the parks ponds or roost in the gigantic trees. The vegetation is fabulous, real tropical rainforest-like, thus creating a jungle-feel. However, outside the park there is another jungle: the concret jungle of Singapore. If you visit the park, it may be a good idea to bring your own cut lunch or snacks and some drinks because the eating places there are perhaps a little expensive. There are endless photo opportunities of course, especially on a nice sunny day.You can reqach the park by public transport from Singapore or if you can afford it, take a taxi (appr. $20-25 Singapore one way). On the way back it may be a good idea to order a taxi to the exit by phone or ask the consierge to order one for you. There maybe a few people there, waiting for a cab, but if you order one, yours will arrive soon and you don't have to line up and wait.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r499872493-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

The bird park was amazing. Lori Loft a particular favourite, but not for those who dont like contact. The tight schedule of tour ment we didn't see half the park only a few exhibits at the beginning, high flyer show, lori loft and waterfall. I would describe the tour as more of an escort, as there wasn't a whole lot of information about the birds, park, area, being shared. Towards the end of our trip thunder began rumbling, (we were happy for a storm to cool things off) our guide appeared concerned he would get wet - we stated we were fine with a bit of rain, yet he hurried us along.

You wouldn't miss much not going, but if you have the time to, dropping by would be worth it too.There are a range of birds, most found in South East Asia, but the concept is rather similar to the Singapore Zoo.Trams are also available upon purchase with entry tickets, but it really isnt necessary to hop on a tram here. Its small enough to walk and you'd be missing out on seeing various bird species when on a tram.Mosquito repellent should be part of your to bring items. There are water coolers situated around the Park, so don't worry about being dehydrated.

You can forget you are in a managed facility in there as the birds fly near by or play in the trees. Its a great place for kids especially if you are trying to get them to be interested in and respect nature. But there are plenty of elderly people in there too enjoying the birds.

Jurong Bird Park,rashig,A good half day outing,40,4-Jun-17,"No matter how much you plan and read the map before you go, you do get confused in these parks. My advice would be to make it for the two morning shows - 10.00 & 11.00 am.Do the tram ride post that. We ended up reaching at 10.30 and immediately followed the herd to stand in the tram line, which was long at that point. Ended up missing the 11 am show also and had to wait all the way till 3 pm for the High Flyers. Had no energy to wait to see the next show at 4 pm. So go early, catch the shows first, and then you are free to wander around. The park is not too big, and can easily be covered in a half day. I found the souvenirs here reasonably priced compared to other tourist attractions. One word of caution - if you feed the lories at Lory Loft, be sure your child is wearing sleeves. The bird are a little heavy and flock down on the person holding the nectar. My daughter got a big scratch on her shoulder. May be an interesting experience, but not my idea of fun. Also, don't miss the breeding & research centre to see for yourself how they help hatch and care for young birds.

The park however requires quite a bit of walking and you may wish to rent a stroller for the entire day at SGD 9 for your kid.

Jurong Bird Park,Tullagirl,Very Interesting,40,15-May-17,We took a taxi from our hotel as we didn't want to do this on a tour. It took about 1/2 hour to get to the bird park and we paid to go on the tram it is well worth the $5.00 as you get to go around the park and see what there is them you can walk to the different areas. The waterfall area is lovely as is the rest of the bird park and the entertainment is well worth seeing. This is good for children. We had a lot of school groups the day we were there.

Jurong Bird Park,HinYeung,Go early to beat the crowds,40,12-May-17,"Getting there and back: take bus #194 from Boon Lay Bus Interchange berth B8, and you alight outside the park. Coming back, you can take the bus from the same bus stop as it is a loop service.Tips:1) Go EARLY (i.e. be there at 8.30 am) to view the birds in relative peace and quiet. It gets packed by afternoon2) If you intend to feed the lories at Lory Loft, the park sells a small cup of nectar water ($3 each - prepare exact change) which will attract them. However, go in the MORNING as the birds will be too full by afternoon, and will ignore you3) F&B is available but overpriced. You can stock up necessities at Jurong Point, the shopping centre next to Boon Lay MRT4) Wear comfortable shoes as the park is on hilly terrain. Also bring mosquito repellent. Most of the park is in the open with no shade5) The majority of the birds are caged up, and you won't be able to take clear photos.

Jurong Bird Park,AKRCH,Nice park,40,11-May-17,Went to Bird park couple of days ago with parents . It was a cloudy day . Still went ahead . Reached by 8.30 that's when they open . Not much crowd when we entered . There are two shows @ 10 and 11 .By the 10 am show crowds started coming in . We did the tram ride as we entered . So not much crowd . Post the shows noticed that tram queues were big as well . Both the shows were good . 11am one was the best . We were lucky that the rain gods were away during the show time .After the shows took a walk around and exited by 12.30-1 pm.Must visit if u have enough time in singapore,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r483418762-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,Ducktalk,Wonderful flying critters,40,8-May-17,"Took a train to Boon Lay station (has a shopping centre there so you can stop and get snacks/lunch etc) then caught the local 194 bus to Jurong Bird Park - takes 10 mins and costs S$3.20 return. Cheap as chips.Get there as early as possible - it gets real hot in Singapore and the crowds at the bird park build up as time goes on. When you've had enough and want to come back, just wait at that same bus stop as the bus does a little u-turn and takes you back to the station. Simple!Entry to the Park is rather pricey at S$29 each, but one doesn't mind if the birds are loved and looked after. Personally I found some of the cages rather small for the larger birds but they all seemed very well cared for.One of the major frustrations for me was the width of the wire on the cages. Most were too close together to get decent photos of the birds (I draw and paint them later so decent photos are important).There's a very staged bird show which those who aren't around birds much may enjoy. I didn't mind it but my partner wasn't too thrilled.Best part was coming across a pond where a staff member was feeding night herons and a rather shy jabiru. They could all fly off if they chose so I had uninhibited access to photograph the birdlife in its natural environment. Happiness plus.Loved the lizards, squirrels, hornbills - well, pretty much everything really. Staff all seemed very pleasant although we didn't have a lot to do with them.HINT - Wouldn't go on a weekend if you can help it - the crowds would be truly nasty.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0f/48/bc/dc/ducktalk.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r482508308-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

We saw more Smurfs than birds, and it was too distracting.The best experience was the Penguin feeding -- not many people so we were able to interact with the trainer (and the penguins)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/4e/bb/d0/scott95401.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r477967169-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Lory loft was temporarily closed when we visited so didn't get to enter to feed the birds or walk on the bridge there.Kids spent the last part of the day at the Kidszone wet playground. Area had a dry and wet playground. Kids absolutely love the wet playground which has a huge bucket of water which would periodically pour down on them. The playground also has some youth employed by the park to play or look out for the kids.Missed the bird shows as it was heavily raining in the afternoon. Few restaurants in the park and a kiosk operated by Pizza Hut. It's called Pizza Hut Express so they may not have a full menu.

Jurong Bird Park,luv_honey,Amazed,40,17-Apr-17,"Years ago during our first visit, it was boring... And we never stepped in again till 5years later today.While looking for Easter Fun activities with kids, I spotted smuff Easter egg hunt happening at JBP.We reached at around 11am, but car park is full(public holiday), we ended up having our lunch elsewhere and returning at 1pm. By then we are able to enter carpark.We spent most of our time in queue, waiting and waiting. There's a big crowd for purchasing their entrance & tram tickets. We thought that's the only 1 that we have to wait. But no, we had to wait for tram(Long queue). And finally we hopped in to tram and its start to rain. We couldn't get off at any stations( our mistakes- no umbrella, no raincoat), this is a must! We return to main station and get our day pass converted to annual pass (promo pay $29 a day can convert to a year). And is such a mess system, we are required to queue again. After done rain stopped, and we queue again for tram! We reach smuff waterfall aviary station at 3:45pm. Reaching the activities station at 3:50pm, and being informed ""sorry that we are closed for the day"". Such a disappointment that they closed at 4pm and it's only happening for 3days. Waterfall aviary is beautiful, we enjoy our walk and scenery there. So far we visited penguin, parrot and we stranded at pelican cove( raining again). We have yet to watch any shows. However, this park is beautiful, although our visit is a waste... By queues, rains... Their nature is fascinating, we will make use their annual pass to visit again!

A great environment for the birds but not so good to look at them. The best view of tropical birds was in the show where they had birds flying between handlers - as in the photo, but you did not see these while walking through.

We visited on a family day which was a big mistake. It was crowded and all facilities were tested to the hilt. We had to queue to see exhibits. We were expecting the birds to be in bigger enclosures. There is nothing sadder than to see a South American condor in a cage that it cannot 'soar' in. There is plenty of signage to inform you as to how well the birds are kept, but you somehow sense that they could be kept better.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/79/default-avatar-2020-21.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r714033358-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,Roderick S,An exotic one-day filler,30,2-Sep-19,"This is a very famous attraction, but I came away mildly disappointed.Access is easy: metro to Boon Lay and a 194 bus from the adjacent interchange, to a stop outside the entry gate.The setting is in dense tropical vegetation: in many ways more interesting than the birds.The birds are organised into about 30 different zones. There are lots of food outlets and toilets and kiddie attractions, but not many seats for those who are toiling in tropical heat on the sloping tracks and steps to view every cage.It is expensive, and the many varied extra features add even more cost.I was doing a basic clockwise walking tour, hoping to obtain more photos than can be achieved by riding the tram. A lot of the birds (mainly the larger ones) weren't visible, let alone photographable. The attraction was busy, with people of all age groups. Half were taking selfies, and most of the rest were photographing the information panels as a substitute for not seeing the birds. I opened with a highlight: the penguin display. Pelicans and flamingos seemed to be too prolific. I finished the circuit with the main highlight: the breeding/research centre, which had many excellent interpretive panels.Overall, it would be easy to fill a whole day if taking in some of the extra features, or just over 3 h if trying to photograph every cage. I completed my circuit in under 3 hours, as I was using it during a transit connection (I pick off something different each time I am connecting in Singapore).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r705545224-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

It's difficult to see the birds through the old-fashioned cages and difficult to take their pictures. Also, the park is on a hill so it's really hard in the heat to walk up and down constantly to see the birds. The little train that takes people around stops too far from the trees we want to see.

Jurong Bird Park,ColinW911,Poor parrots. Lucky Loris,30,20-Apr-19,Came here for a day this week. Generally a pleasant although 'old school'ù experience especially the high flying bird show and especially the parrot that could sing in three languages. Impressive stuff. The Loris loft was also very good with good flying space for the birds.On the disappointing side was the 'Parrot Paradise'ù which looked more like hell for the poor birds clinging to the outside of their too-small cages and having their claws hit with plastic water bottles by ignorant stupid children unrestrained by their even worse parents. Grrrrrrr.Also the catering at Curry Gardenn was completely chaotic. Overwhelmed by the number of customers they simply gave up taking orders.

The Lory Loft was our favorite exhibit where one could walk with a cup of nectar for lories to feed from, right on your hand. Just beware of their droppings.The staff made up for the worn down architecture and finishings of the location. The bird's cages were necessary but also felt restrictive after visiting the open habitats of the Zoo and Night Safari.

A huge area to cover by foot, it is also rather hilly and tiresome on a hot day. We decided to purchase a $5 ticket for the hop on/off tram. It has about 5 designated stops and passes many important exhibits, that if you wish to see, you would have to walk back to. We didn't as it meant too much walking up and down hills.

Jurong Bird Park,Summerfires,Beautiful but changes needed,30,25-Feb-19,"I felt a little conflicted coming here because I hate the thought of birds in cages but I have never before seen a park dedicated to purely to such an array of birds.Get there early, definitely by taxi (approx $25 rush hour time from Clarke Quay way) and enjoy having the park to yourself for a while. The highlights were by far the shoebills and the wide variety of hornbills. They do need bigger enclosures as do the birds of prey. The walk in aviaries were an wonderful experience, especially birds of asia and the waterfall aviary - these do seem the right size for the birds they have flying around. The penguins however looked very desolate and is much need of an expansion and upkeep.I went to the high flyers show, I really didn't like the ending which I know should be the highlight but there had so many birds on stage thought it probably was a stressful experience for birds involved. Keepers however handled them well and were enthusiastic in explaining about protecting birds' environments.I spent abut 4 hours here as I loved viewing each type of bird, you never get this opportunity to see the size of some of them or hear what they sound like flying around and talking. However I couldn't help thinking that the quality of life for some of the birds particularly was really poor given their enclosure size. They probably could do with more information signs to go with their endangered level and how the park is supporting their conservation and expanding some of the enclosure sizes.The same could probably be said of alot of zoos and likely comes with the nature of attraction trying to balance out quality vs public being able to see them",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r654769134-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

It is quite a long way to wall to see all of the exhibits. I don't know what I expected, but most of the birds were in cages which is a disappointment and somewhat sad to see such beautiful creatures locked away like that. Some of the Parrots at Parrot Paradise looked as if they were stressed, showing repetitive behavior that caged animals so often do after prolonged captivity. I actually found it upsetting. The Waterfall Aviary was however good, with free flying birds in a big enclosure and the birdsong was a wonderful experience (not that you could actually see the singing birds all of the time). In all it is a place that can thrill and disappoint at the same time.

Only attractions where kids enjoyed were Penguin feeding and Pelican feeding. They should have kept more shows or interaction with birds to make it worthwhile. Ideally one should do Singapore Zoo and skip Bird Park.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/15/ad/1e/b3/jigneshk60.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r641595572-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,Michael K,"A little bit long in the tooth, with good reason",30,20-Dec-18,"I first visited Jurong Bird Park in 1988, 30 years ago, and I was blown away by its beauty and variety. Now it looked kind of run down with too many old fashioned exhibits of birds in heavy wire cages. I learned that this is probably the last year it will be open in its present location as a NEW Jurong Bird Park is being built in the same area as the Singapore Zoo I have a feeling that the new one will be the best bird park in the World when it's finished. It really makes me want to come back to Singapore.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/e9/96/bd/michael-k.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r640586766-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Yvonne Norton L,Disappointing,30,11-Nov-18,Great place for children to be introduced to exotic birds but disappointing to someone who prefers birds in their natural setting even if somewhat confined. Birds performed tricks and most were in cages. Some fairly large cages but still unable to fly. Needs serious updating to meet new standards for avaries where birds have a lot of freedom and people are confined! Great 'collection'ù of birds but saw no evidence of protecting from extinction or special breeding programs.

The place gives that wonderful experience of being with the birds while feeling that they are not constrained in a cage. The budding bird watcher in my son enjoyed the park.A bit of eye soar was the staff attitude. There was not enough warmth with the staff. Even though I had the park hopper plus ticket which entitled me for tram service. The staff front ending the tram service was more interested in chatting with her colleagues than to check my ticket.

Good for the first time visitors but same story as night Safari park, zoo and river safari, park has not upgraded since last 10 years and only saving grace were the shows actually repeated shows with same themes, if it rains you are screwed and shows gets cancelled (here cannot blame the park) but there is no alternative they have in place as all the employees volunteers disappear and tourist are left on their own and this same experience over the years, was at least happy to see birds. quality of restaurants were bad.

There are two shows where birds are trained and is pretty amazing. There is a singing and talking parrot as well. Also, the park is situated on kind of a hill which makes it difficult to walk.

Jurong Bird Park,231DebB,Don't bother with lunch with the parrots,30,12-Sep-18,"Thought we would pay to have lunch with the parrots. Instead they shuffle you inside to a buffet restaurant & then tell you that you can take a drink or dessert out to the terrace where they do a small bird show. Really not worth the money to do. The advertising picture shows a lovely white table cloth with food & parrots right next to the visitors. It's nothing like this at all.Some of the areas of the park are great, mainly the huge netted walk through areas. Others are are very boring with many cages and dark shaded & overgrown areas. You will only interact with birds in the area where they have the lorikeets or in the main bird show.I visited Kaunda Birdworld in Australia and was sort of expecting something better but was disappointed. There are however an enormous amount of birds but I don't like looking at them in the smaller cages.Also in one of their displays they have a picture of a wallaby & joey but have labelled it as a kangaroo which is incorrect.Hope breakfast with the orangutans are better at the zoo and we haven't wasted our money.",https://static.tacdn.com/img2/generic/site/no_user_photo-v1.gif,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r615939780-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

What's not acceptable is that everyone that was there for the show had to squeeze behind the small shelter behind the viewer seatings, waiting for the rain to end or to be less heavy so that we can make it to other shows.The bird park should have some contingency for these scenarios so that visitors can still move back to the main entrance hall in the event umbrellas are not available instead of being stranded at one location.My suggestion may not be suitable as the park is meant to be",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r591031404-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Amacr R,"Jurong Bird Park is an aviary and tourist attraction in Jurong, Singapore.",30,19-Jun-18,"African Waterfall AviaryThe African Waterfall Aviary is the second largest walk-in aviary in the world, covering 2 hectares (4.9 acres) and including more than 600 free-flying birds of more than 50 species. The aviary is named after the 30-metre (98 ft) tall Jurong Falls, one of the world's tallest man-made waterfalls. Species include the golden-breasted starling, turacos and the hoopoe.Dinosaur DescendantsIn one corner of the zoo there is a section full of flightless birds: ostriches, emus, rheas and cassowaries are the residents of this exhibit.Wings of AsiaVisitors can see the largest collection of Southeast Asian birds, which has over 200 species. There are large, central walk-in aviaries and peripheral aviaries housing the more delicate and territorial birds. A thunderstorm is simulated at noon each day, followed by a cool, light drizzle. Territorial species are kept in large cages, while species that can coexist with each other (fruit doves and pigeons being two examples) are left to roam freely in the aviary.Lory LoftThe Lory LoftAbout nine storeys high and covering 3,000 square metres (32,000 sq ft), the Lory Loft is the world's largest walk-in flight aviary for lories and lorikeets, with over 1,000 free-flying lories. The ambience is similar to that of a rainforest valley in tropical Northern Australia. Visitors can offer the lories a special nectar mix.Penguin CoastPenguinsHouses five species of penguins within 1,600 square metres (17,000 sq ft). Featuring a 21-metre (69 ft) tall Portuguese galleon fa√ßade and designed to resemble a ship, the interior of Penguin Coast is constructed with timber beams and wooden flooring. Penguin Coast is home to the Humboldt, rockhopper, macaroni and king penguins, which live in an indoor, climate-controlled den with access to an outdoor enclosure showcasing African penguins, one of the few species that are adapted to the tropics. Joining them are cape shelducks and gulls.World of DarknessAsia's first nocturnal bird house features a system of reverse lighting, converting day to night and vice versa. On display are 60 birds from 17 species, like the night herons, fish owls, boobook owls and snowy owls. It is akin to a quiet nocturnal walk along a starlit jungle path, watching birds in their nocturnal surroundings and hearing them beckon each other.Pelican CoveVisitors catch a glimpse of all seven species of pelicans, including the endangered Dalmatian pelican. There is a board-walk where visitors can stroll and observe the birds.

They all should have been in way bigger areas. However, some of the birds were kept in forested areas with netting to keep them in, so they had a lot of space to fly around.

Even though I'd pre purchased tickets it took 15 mins to get them verified and us to get let in. Very wierd ..The park is nice and veryyyy long to walk I feel that there wasn't enough birds let out loose to interact with as there could have been... most birds were caged...The biggest let down was the water park it was down for repairs.. it was what we were really looking forward to for our baby on that hot day. They could have mentioned it! We would have come back on a day it was open..The birds are beautiful and worth a visit if you get tickets off HANDY I wouldn't pay full price for this...Definitely take photos with the gorgous biting bird and do the forest walk... really nice,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/25/ae/72/najlaber08511.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r546305188-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Let's be honest, the stalls are overpriced. We also had brought park hopper tickets to go to night safari after, so the tickets in my inbox were in the order of BP,NS,BP,NS etc. Instead of scanning all the bird park tickets, he just scanned the first 5, which included a few of our night safari tickets. When I asked him, he just waved me off and said it didn't matter.

Jurong Bird Park,sachinvmehta,Only one way to summarise the place 'Strictly okay',30,30-Oct-17,"Nothing much to write home about. It is a place for people who love birds, that is it. Perhaps, it is one of the only bird parks around in the world but then, does it make sense to cage so many birds. Anyways, the highlight of the park are the 2 live events that they have - Kings of the Skies and High Fliers Show. Do check the timings of these events before you step in to the park. They are worth watching (heck, looks like they are the only ones worth watching).Also, there is a small water play area around in the Jurong Bird Park which kids might love to splash around. It does tend to get a bit monotonous and with so much walking around, kids might enjoy in the water play area, so do remember to take your children's water clothes and a new set of change clothes if they want to go in the water play area. It is nothing fancy but then, getting wet with couple of slides is so much fun for the kids.There is a single bus that travels from the Boon Lay MRT that goes to the Jurong Bird Park, right up to its gate, Bus No. 194. You need to get down at Boon Lay MRT and take the Exit D and go to the Boon Lay Interchange where in there are numerous stops for various buses with Bus No. 194 at one end for Jurong Bird Park. While coming back, you just need to get out of the Jurong Bird Park, cross the road, under the flyover and get on the other side and take the same bus to reach Boon Lay MRT.Bus service in Singapore is awesome and it is worth the money one pays for.Just do remember to buy an EZ Link Card the day you step in to Singapore - it costs about SGD 12 (SGD 5 for the card and SGD 7 for usage). But boy is this card helpful - any bus, MRT you can just tap in and tap out. No need to fish for change and ask for how much is it to travel to the destination. You can top it out at any of the MRT so you are good to go. Alternatively, ask the hotel you are staying at, whether they can provide you with a used EZ Link card - that way you can save that SGD 5 of the cost of the card too.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/21/ca/7c/sachinvmehta.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r537092145-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Manish-blr,shows are good but overall not great,30,2-Oct-17,"it has lots of greenery and bunch of happy birds, shows are the attraction and very nice, but morning show got cancelled due to rain.but have some suggestions to improve:1. Tram is totally waste of money and useless - its a multi bogey fossil fuel driven belching unburnt fuel smell, which has like 3 stops which are useless as you have to walk to each enclosure. They should learn from Delhi zoo, where battery driven single bogey tram continuously move around so you visit one enclosure and then can catch the next one to go farther.2. there are few trams, so you wait endlessly for one to come, and after the shows or on crowded days, this is quite painful3. the strollers provided are not ergonomical nor shaded, they should check with Universal studios, as rental charge is almost same",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/10/d6/0c/14/manish-blr.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r528860636-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,TravelBuddyFromDelhi,Visit only if you have spare time and young kids,30,13-Sep-17,The place is good but far off with no other addons in near by area.

One of the best parts is the gift shop and cafe next to the Entrance.

Jurong Bird Park,Sparkle77123,Not as fancy as I had imagined,30,26-Aug-17,"Its good for kids and especially for people who have never been to a bird park before (say San Diego), otherwise its okay. what is good, is that it is walkable for elderly people and children. I was in time for the show, during afternoon, and i was overall impressed.Now some practical stuff:1) In case you tend to use MRT, come to Boon Lay station, head straight towards the bus terminal on the ground floor and ask for the bus number (i forget now), its 15 minutes then. So if are a group and not on tight budget, might as well as take a cab!2) Jurong Bird park and Night safari are two different places. First thing, you should ask is when the bus departs from Bird Park to the Jurong Night Safari. We did not ask as we did not know nor was there any board which says the two are different.

The zoo was very spread out so you had to walk long ways till you saw something and felt bit lonely in parts- the kids were hot and found it bit hard going.the only good part was the lorikeet enclosure but the variety in here was not great - they had a few friendly vareitys of lorikeets birds but some of the rainbow lorikeets were bit testy and angry..was a lovely enclosure but having a good vast variety of birds everywhere would be a brilliant tourist attraction. looking forward to seeing the new location.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/13/99/4f/fc/mandosozza.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r502709325-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Also dont forget your sunblock!!It is a great park, even for adults.I gave the park a 3 stars because it lacks of dining option. When we visited the park, the only option is only at the entrance of the park, or the buffet option inside the park.The fact that a restaurant is located at the entrance minimized you to dine at you own convenient time, either you eat before or after you tour the park, although this dining place have good selections.The buffet option however give yourself the convenient timing to dine according to your liking, it also have option for dinining with bird show, which is fun for the children.

Jurong Bird Park,RuchiS111,Fantastic but limited bird park,30,30-Mar-17,Jurong bird park has lot of parrots from all over the world. They offer a bird show where birds sing and show various tricks and then they have a 100 ft man-made waterfall which is beautiful to look at. They also have a small variety of other birds but the park still has a long way to go. In my opinion calling it a bird park is not justified and they can work on improvements. My recommendation is to opt for it as a side trip only if you have time.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r471301566-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

I find it particularly annoying that although the enclosures are labelled with the name of the bird(s) species, there is no map or in most cases any indication of where they come from.

Jurong Bird Park,SarthakKR,#Overall Jurong Experience#,30,20-Jan-17,"Me and my family visited Jurong Bird Park on 24th Dec 2016. Transportation to Jurong is very easy via MRT or Bus. It is highly connected to both. Overall park experience and the bird species are good and one time must go kind of. But the only must watch show is High Flyer Show. Pelican chit Chat and kings of the Sky shows are really boring and not that interactive. As we visited Singapore in rainy season so it is highly recommended to carry umbrella. A small water play area called Birdz of play was the most enjoyable place for my kids, so carry ur swim wears along. I am vegetarian and the food options for me everywhere were ice cream, potato fries and chips so better to carry your own home-made sandwiches, as there are many places for sitting n resting over there to enjoy ur food and the food joints are little bit over priced. Do not buy souvenirs from this place, for that the best place is China town. On public holidays and weekends Jurong provide a free shuttle service to the nearest MRT station and that is a real relief.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/2f/ca/c6/sarthak-k-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r453551102-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,dewdrop1303,A poorer cousin to the other attractions,30,20-Oct-16,"Suggest to go to this place first before others. This bird park had been around for more than 45 years and it's showing ... though you can tell a lot of effort still goes to the feather friends to maintain an enjoyable visit. Also u can tell there have been constant upgrading to upkeep the interest of this place. The two shows are alright, some parts are actually quite impressive but pale in comparison to the zoo and night safari. Also little interactive between the birds and visitors. The children water play and playground are loads of fun so do plan extra time. We went at 2pm, watch the two shows, spent an hour in the water play and left with very little time to explore and understand the birds. The park closes at 6pm. Looking forward to the move to Mandai, u can bet it will be exciting.

Jurong Bird Park,Lorraine B,Ok,30,5-Oct-16,"When I heard there was a bird park in Singapore I was excited, as I love birds. I was a tad dissapointed whilst wandering around though honestly. The food was very overpriced, although it did come with a souvenir cup. The park itself was large, and had a few hills. For someone like me who has physical illnesses, I found it difficult in the heat. I did see transportation go past in the grounds, but I couldn't see any signage around as to what it was or the cost if any. I did however see the bird park had wheelchairs and prams for rent which was great. As for the birds, 8 felt a bit sorry for them. Their enclosures seem to have everything they need in there, but some of them seemed a bit cramped. The bird show I saw was good, but it wasn't very interactive with the audience which was a shame, and it seemed that if you got there early and sat up front, then you were punished by not being one of the chosen few who got to interact with the birds. They did however offer free photos at the end, but tbh It felt as if you'd be giving them the rights to use your image by letting them take your photo, and so I sadly declined. Jurong bird park has the makings of a great place, and the staff were lovely for the most part. I hope peoole see the potential in this bird park, and it continues to grow with time and money invested.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/11/21/35/facebook-avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r425317729-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,625edwarda,Better things to visit in Singapore,30,11-Sep-16,"My children were looking forward to seeing the park but even they were left a little deflated. There are some very good exhibits like the waterfall aviary and the pelican grove but the lory loft and penguin coast were a let down. The Penguins reminiscent of a scene in Happy Feet stuck behind a glass window was rather boring and the lory loft was saturated by far too many people. Like most attractions in the world, visit this place during the week to get the best experience.The aviary waterfall was amazing and peaceful, also the birds inside were very colourful. There is another exhibit called Jungle Jewels, that is worth visiting too and much more to look at than the lory flora and fauna was exemplary too, lots of lovely trees and flowers to look at and take pictures of.Overall the place is clean and tidy but the exhibits could, or should, be more spacious for bigger birds.

There was an African Grey parrot which decide to get over friendly with my friend. Kept trying to land on her and if you have ever got close to a parrot you will know that their beaks are very strong.

Jurong Bird Park,unicon95,An interesting catchup with an old place,30,26-Jul-16,"I brought my mother and sister here to celebrate my mother's birthday (Singaporeans get free entry on their birthdays). Service crew were pleasant and welcoming, and pretty professional too.Park space, though small, was well utilised, with many exhibits presented nicely. Do not underestimate the size of the park: there are actually many exhibits to cover amongst the hidden pathways! Over so many years (last I visited was over 10 years ago), much of the flora and fauna have matured, lending a natural touch to the park's atmosphere.My gripe is that the park is not easily accessible, and that ticket prices are not actually attractive enough to encourage repeated visits, especially for locals. Its a pity that the monorail could not be retained. I could see that the stations have been repurposed though.Overall, it was a nostalgic visit that allowed me to relive my childhood days.

Honestly speaking, they haven't do a facelift or improvement for many years. I seriously feel they ought to revamp the park, to keep it up to trend. The huge indoor aviary has always my children's favorite spot in the park. That is something you can get up close and personal with birds in there.Food & beverage in the park not worth the value spend. High priced or over priced food without quality. We had to eat there just for the sake of the children.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/4f/18/9b/erik2938.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r395351982-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,waimengy2017,"Nice, but not enough for one full day of exploration",30,10-Jun-16,"It has been quite a few years since I have last visited Jurong Bird Park. I decided to bring my family to visit during the school holidays. First of all, it was not crowded. I suppose the travelling distance is a key consideration. Second, the exhibits were quite spaced out, and there's a lot of variety of species to view. That's good for avid fans. Third, the walking can be quite tiring. You need to be prepared to walk around for quite a bit. There are not many places for people to rest. Fourth, the shows are not really that fascinating. I must qualify that I have only seen two shows - high fliers and birds of prey. The first one was not that bad, but the second was a little dull.I guess I may be a little more picky because I was comparing this with the Zoo, which offers a lot more different animal species to view and learn about. But it's still worth a visit with your children, especially if you want them to get in contact with nature more often.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/10/ac/04/dd/wai-meng-y.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r381159200-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,srividhu,Not as good as it was several years back,30,26-Apr-16,"Jurong Bird Park is not as attractive and good as it was few years back. The Bird shows are more commercial now. The tallest artifical waterfalls fails to make an impression. Have been here in 2001 and 2002. The varities of birds on display and the shows were more realisitc. Even the photos that we take with the birds at the entrance are not appealing.Earlier we were permitted to hold real big colourful birds on our hands and take photos. Now it is like small love birds are made to sit on a holding stand and we have to take photos with them. There are not much takers for this now. Another important aspect noticed was the toilets maintanence. They were not upto the Singapore standards. Very untidy, No tissues in some rooms. And no food available for vegetarians. We and our children had ice cream for lunch as we are pure vegetarians.

Jurong Bird Park,Nina L,A big cage is still a cage!,30,25-Apr-16,"If you have a healthy heart- ditch the tram! JBP has attractions on either side of a trail-you can thus walk and stop at each attraction, tick it off your map and be done in 3 hours! The tram bypasses lots of the attractions (takes you to key stops)- you would then need to backtrack to cover the rest- which ends up being a pain! You can make it as leisurely or as rushed as you want it.Still- the lory loft is adorable coz the lories are brilliantly colourfully friendly! The large aviaries are wonderful just because the sight of birds flying uplifts you after the cages! Waterfall aviary is impressively man-made. Penguins are an adorable must see!It can get hot, very sweaty and dehydrating. Take sunglasses. The gift shop is a joke (stuffed animal toys) (what!?!).PS. Closest MRT is Boon Lay.

But I have to say, they tried their best to make full use of what they have.To be frank, the ticket price is relatively expensive.

Jurong Bird Park,Perthyte,"Nice bird park, but some of the enclosures were disappointing",30,26-Jan-16,"We had an enjoyable day at Jurong, with the highlight of the day being the High Flyers bird show which included low flying, talking and singing birds. Some enclosures were spacious and enabled visitors to see the birds clearly. Others unfortunately were surrounded by thick wire, with visitors kept at least a meter from the enclosure, which made taking photos and seeing the birds clearly difficult.

The park is easily accessible by Metro - to BOON LAY station on the east west line then transfer to the bus interchange to Bus No 194 which runs a regular service to and from the bird park.At the bird park we noted that once again Singapore has introduce multiple pricing for locals and tourists - for tourists the entrance fee was $SG 33 (no discount).Several areas of the park we closed for renovations.There is a tram service around the park which stops at three stations - Main Stn, Lorry Loft - well worth a visit to feed the lorikeets and Waterfall stn to visit the indoor waterfall .The park has a huge array of bird life - but on this visit we noted that the park has a run down appearance - needs a coat of paint in may places and many of the aviaries require updating - in fact some of the birds appeared distressed especially in the parrot exhibitsThere are various areas for having a meal - we had lunch in the BONGO BURGERS restaurant - well worth a visitThe main impression we had of the park in this visit is that the park requires an update/renovation",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/14/fe/5b/24/george-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r342708458-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Pete_Gill_W,Personally we were disappointed by our visit,30,20-Jan-16,"We took the MRT from the city to Boon Lay, then we crossed the road to the bus station to get the 194 bus, travel taking circa 90 minutes. Cost to enter the park SGD$28pp.Many of the birds are hard to see as the cages are old, with old thick wire restricting view - no chance of clear photographs as the cage dominates. We appreciate securing the birds in space that does not stress them is essential, but we have been to many bird parks where the cages are much more viewer friendly. A number of displays were closed for improvement work (which is hopefully good news, given our previous comment). We watched one of the twice daily bird shows which was limited and disappointing, having been spoiled by the high quality of a similar style show at Taronga Zoo in Sydney. The talking parrot was amusing and the flamingos walking on stage at the end were the highlights. The walk through areas had few bird species that are rare or excite. Staff were not engaging, unlike the staff at Singapore Zoo.Coffee just before we entered the park was good, but all in all we left feeling disappointed with the visit and value for money.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0b/80/eb/e7/pete-gill-w.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r341345274-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Take a park hopper if planning to visit all the parks.Now for the bird park, its relatively small, but can be very muggy and hot if there is no wind blowing. The shows are good and the highlight. Previously there was opportunity for having pictures with birds sitting on shoulders and hand. Unfortunately they only put small birds on a wooden stick and ask you to hold the stick.The park is in a different location as compared to the zoo. If four poeple then take a taxi.

Jurong Bird Park,andrewgraham52,BELOW AVERAGE,20,28-Jan-20,"More geared as a children's theme parkThis is my THIRD visit to Jurong Bird Park, over 18 years and I have watched it's slow decline, today I was unimpressed and appauled at some of the psittacines genera enclosures. Some enclosures I felt had too many birds for the size of the enclosure, such as the Lears Macaw with one Macaw having no feathers on its head, was it sick or being plucked by others ? All the same it wasn't a good look. Some psittacine enclosures just had bare minimum of natural enrichment activities, just branches as perches and ropes. The Spix Macaw flight enclosure was what I had expected, many leafed branches, trees and branches, however neither Spix Macaw was visiable and I wondered if they were still actually housed at Jurong anymore, it was a real disappointment not see this magnificent Macaw.There appears to be a significant decline in the actual numbers of psittacine species now housed at the Park, as very few Amazons as to past years, no Quakers, and 4 Caiques amongst others.Many of the parrot enclosures all the birds were clinging to the wire high at the back of their enclosure, obviously not content to perch on the few branches in each enclosure so this was a sad sight.The free flight bird shows, are still highly entertaining, and I applaude the lectures to the crowd on the responsibilities of caring for a parrot and the importance of parrot conservation, the show is a good educational lesson for all.Many people delight in having their picture taken with a Macaw or a large species parrot, but enquiring this is no longer possible, only to be told you can hold a T bar with conures , even thou the designated area for picture opportunity had macaws and cockatoos perched on stands.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r741656447-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

SGD$25 for 1 photo.Me: We will not buy it.Your staff: LAST CHANCE. SGD$20 for 1 PHOTO.We then walked away. Quoting an outrageous price SGD $50 for 1 photo?Discount offered? That means the price quoted is not fixed and you can bargain with the price?Is it a park owned business or privately operated business at Jurong Bird Park?Such method of price quotation really deter tourists from having enjoyable moments at the park.2. Poor staff training and miscommunication among staffBefore I made my visit to Jurong Bird Park, I have asked the staff whether it is possible to redeem the Lunch with Parrots with the iVenture cards. The reply I received is positive and clearly stating that I can redeem at the restaurants. However, the staff at the restaurant have no idea what I am talking about when I made the visit.

We headed to the bird park on the first afternoon. (Didn't realise it was so far).It came to rain but we still wondered around the whole place.If I'm honest I think the pace is really run down and not worth a visit. Birds didn't look great and especially the avary part where peacocks roam freely etc. The place was filthy. Yes birds are messy but when there are cafes near by etc it was full of poo and just felt old.To top it off o sent my kids to buy bird food. Advertises $2. My son came back with 2 and no change. The guys don't have change here be warned and stick the whole lot into a donation box. So it's not actually $2 it was $5.

Please don't forget to care for the well being of the birds that are caged first, protecting them from physical interaction from visitors second.If you want visitors to stay away from the birds.

Jurong Bird Park,lindajE658CD,Expensive entry fee,20,13-Sep-18,Not worth the money. We lived in Singapore 14 years ago and the bird park was fantastic then.

Jurong Bird Park,chiongmt,Park Premises looks run down,20,17-Aug-18,The park really needs a makeover. As I walked along the premises to view the exhibits I can't help but notice that everything looks old and unappealing to the eyes. I am greeted mostly by the unwelcoming smell of bird stench. Its understandable to have the smell but perhaps it could be kept in check by regular cleaning?The water in which the birds are frolicking in seems dirty. E.g the penguins and flamingos. The washroom also needs some maintenance. The taps are not working well.

Jurong Bird Park,Tonya G,Disappointed,20,8-May-18,"I love birds and really went out of my way to go here. What a letdown. The only exhibits worth seeing are the waterfall pavillion and the lorry loft because birds have somewhat of a natural environment to fly around and be free. The larger birds like hawks, hornbills, parrot exhibits almost made me cry. It was horrendous. Miserable birds in small pens. No toys or stimulation or anything to engage with. Such smart intelligent birds kept that way really put me off this place. Parrots and Macaws like to live in the treetops not so low down. Everywhere you looked there were birds hanging off the tops of cages as if to want to escape. The whole Disneyland train thing was a bit much even though it helped with the heat the prerecorded messages were smarmy. Too many loud noisy tourists allowed in the park at once. Can you go anywhere in Asia withour animals/birds being treated like a freakshow? They are razing their nature to the ground to build up their cities thus destroying the natural world so they can put their wildlife in cages. It's super depressing. Was really expecting more natural conditions for them. Less stupid man made pretend tree light shows and more money to preserve your real treasures - nature and wildlife please.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r578580272-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Location is quite far from city, we caught Uber because it is far from MRT, you need to catch bus.The park is old and rundown, looks like the birds and cages were not properly taken care.

Jurong Bird Park,schmonkey,Feels like Bird Prison and a tourist trap at times,20,13-Feb-18,"The conditions the birds have to put up with are not good at all. Cages are very small, some of the larger birds can hardly ever move around. Jurong Bird Prison would be a more suitable name for some of what you see. As for the visitor experience, the park is very commercialized. More often than not it feels like it's all about selling food, drinks, and other trinkets, while the birds are just a sideshow, and when you want to leave, you discover the only way out is to walk through a gift shop and a restaurant, as there is no other exit. Still, at least you as a visitor can eventually get out of this tourist trap, while the birds don't have this luxury. On the upside, all the staff were friendly, and the labels are interestingly written in good English. The birds themselves are magnificent but the area of the park is too small to host so many species, which is especially noticeable with the larger birds of prey, and some of the toucans.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0b/39/94/df/apefruit.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r560144046-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Went for parrot & Lory feeding and had photos taken. The person kept asking me to buy the photos. First said $35 for one. And when rejected, he lowered to 2 for $50. And when further rejected, he said 5 for $50. What is the actual price?? My dad did buy finally but That's not the kind of attitude I expect of a kids attraction at SG. If u want to build memories, take the pictures of happy guests who love nature and animals, post them on your Facebook and not just think of making quick bucks.3. Food selection was very limited. Apart from hawk cafe outside (ridiculous pricing) there's nothing much inside.

At the moment it is a trip to Jurong East metro then a taxi to the park. I paid for lunch with the birds as did two other families. The food was very poor both in quality and variation. The bird show was nothing that I hadn't seen before and only mildly entertaining.

Many of the larger birds out in the open and very hot enclosures where 'hen pecked' and feathers out many had sores on them wasn't pleasant at all. We bought the 4 park pass along with the zoo, so we were quite looking forward to it and were in and out as quick as we could be as seeing the state of some of the birds - just wasn't nice. There didn't even seem staff to be around to even check on any as you would expect. The only heartwarming thing was we saw when we were leaving the park that it was moving in 2020 to the Singapore Zoo - that is the best idea and we will make sure we revisit the Bird Park when it is being looked after under the careful eye of the brilliant Singapore Zoo.

The birds are kept in relative small and crowded cages contrary the other zoos in Singapore. We saw birds trying to fly but were immediately hit themselves on the roof, couldn't even fully stretch their wings in the process. The park itself is big, has a lot breeds a parrot aviary where you can feed lories and a waterfall aviary where some birds can fly freely. But it's a pain to see the others in the little cages. It should be like in KL where a huge park is covered with net and all the birds are free to fly. If you haven't been in the KL Bird Park and have a half day for it, then maybe you can visit it.

Jurong Bird Park,thresh369,Zero management,20,22-Aug-15,"The experience as a whole is not too bad. I will begin with the good parts:If you go there in the morning, it is more quiet, (remember to put on some insect repellent spray if you are prone to attract mosquitoes). If you like a bit of walking it is a nice time to be there. We took the tram though. The bird feed near the waterfall was a lot of fun and you can take some close up pictures with them. There is a park for the children to get wet and play. We went for Lunch with Parrot. The lunch part was horrible(see below), the parrot show was very good, educational and entertaining, suitable for children between 4-11.The bad part: I don't know why people will feed chips to the birds. Chips! The snack they sold you from the cafe are meant for you to eat only. If you can run a bird park by feeding chips to bird you can run one in your backyard. Please people.The Lunch with parrot at Songbird terrace: When we arrived the place was closed to everyone. There were already 60-80 people inside, some more were waiting. Around 10 or more empty tables were available so I walked pass the barrier strings to told a male waiter I have a booking.The reply I got was they have no place for me, the main reason being there was a tour group of 200 people strong booked lunch there. If I must have lunch there they will have a place for me, but it will be at least 12:45 or later. The parrot show starts at 1:00 p.m. and we are due to leave at 2:00 p.m.I asked if we will be compensated if we eat elsewhere since we already made full payment for lunch at 12:00. The overbooking was not our fault and I do not understand why our booking was on a lower priority.The answer was no, my money was only good there. I told the male waiter that having 15 minutes for lunch then run to a show is not acceptable. He can either give us a table at noon or not. I showed him my confirmation e-mail from the sales team. He simply ignored the letter and began to question the authenticity of my booking. He wanted me to give him credit card receipt or proof that I paid. The only thing you got by booking online is one e-mail with details of booking and a confirmation number, to which he chose to ignored. If this is truly how booking system works, what is the point of sending me a confirmation e-mail with a 7digit confirmation number?I insisted I have paid and he reluctantly set us a table, screeching chairs and banging tables to show us his displeasure. I made some calls and was reassured that we indeed have paid and was entitled to our seats.The tour guide of the said 200 people tourist groups seem to be acquainted with the male waiter and was pressing him for more tables, I don't know whether there are other deals between them but the waiter was obviously turning down every other customers away from the place to accommodate her tour.When I told the waiter that I have called the sales team to confirmed again that I have paid. He became very defensive and said he was merely trying to tell me they have two types of booking. Now, it really does not matter to me if there are ten types of booking because when I showed him proof of a genuine booking confirmation, he cannot recognize it.When the place is overbooked/double booked, I was given zero prior notice and my booking was thrown away like dirt on the spot. They were simply turning paid customers away without proper explanation and alternative arrangements. If I took the waiter's word for it and went elsewhere, I stand to lose time and money.Now if the 200 people tour did have a booking, and their booking, for some mysterious reasons not disclosed to me, enjoyed a higher priority then mine, they can simply reject my online booking(which was made more than two weeks prior to my visit to the park) or sent me an e-mail to discuss alternative arrangements, they have done neither of that. So I cannot help but think that the tour booking was prioritized for other reasons.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r302024984-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,DiceyMorris1978,Another waste of time and money...,20,22-Jul-15,"I last visited the Jurong Bird Park in 2012 and really enjoyed the experience despite not actually being the biggest fan of birds or being a fan of bird in enclosed spaces. This visit was less than pleasant for a number of reasons...Firstly, that great capitalist enterprise Wildlife Reserves Singapore have scored another great point for capitalism. Entry fees are extortionate and food and beverage (they've got you trapped again!) are outrageously overpriced.The park is dirty and not well kept anymore. The sense of lack of care was evident throughout. Attractions are really showing their age. The pelican pool for example was covered in algae and stank as the water was almost completely stagnant.However, true capitalism really came into its own at the entrance way. An opportunity for to have pictures taken with parrots was ruined when a single picture was offered to us at the absolutely eye watering, mouth dropping price of S$70!!!!Until Wildlife Reserve Singapore gets its act in order and rethinks the way it charges people (yes these things should cost money but seriously folks....) tourists should avoid, avoid, avoid!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r291299355-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

I went to the service desk and asked they ring several taxi companies to get at least 20 taxi's sent out.even taxi's dropping off people wouldn't collect from the queue and just take offwhen we got a taxi we asked the driver and he said drivers don't come to Jurong and that was pretty obvious from the queue.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/2e/76/83/nttravellerz.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r278867666-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,David B,Frustrating day.,20,4-Jun-15,We had been told by friends that the Jurong Bird Park was an excellent place to visit so we were looking forward to it. Maybe we have been spoiled by the Singapore Zoo and we also had my sister there who is from St. Louis with another excellent Zoo but although the variety is great and you could spend a lot of time there we found our time frustrating. Why?First it is not easy to get to or leave. It is quite far from any MRT/train station so you need to take the taxi if you are older and can't walk as far as you used to. Then when your ready to leave you either stand for an hour to get a taxi or call you. If you live in Singapore then great you have a phone but I saw some folks with small children begging to borrow a phone to call a taxi which they finally got help from someone.Second the phamplets and signs at the park are a joke and confusing. We wanted to see the Flamingo feeding so we waited at the Flamingo lake and nothing happened then looked closer and it said Flamingo pool which was another place.Third the cages of many of the birds were so dark and dense mesh it was hard to see the birds or get good pictures.There were highlights of couse and i am sure the shows were good but we missed to timing. The Lorry section was great.All in all a disappointing day. I hear they are going to combine the Bird park with the Zoo and I think that will really up the attraction. So I would suggest visitng other attractions in Singapore if you have limited time. That is unless you are an avid bird watcher.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/6e/11/51/david-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r277627853-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

It is very well developed, managed and maintained bird park but there is nothing much natural there. There are variety of birds from across continents but majority of them are caged. There are shows that are conducted and really well trained birds that display stunts for one to enjoy but not for someone who has seen them in their natural habitat. Birds are to be enjoyed in natural habitat where one can has to put efforts to sight them and get to learn their natural ways, that is real learning. This is more for small kids to enable them to see the birds live instead of books, if that is not the purpose can be avoided. Thumbs down to the park as per me.

Why? Well, both species of parrot have incredibly different food needs. Due to an abnormally long gut Eclectus need primarily fruit diets whilst Lorikeets often struggle eating solid food so eat nectar only usually.Tourists were being given cups of nectar formula and being encouraged to feed it to both species of parrots.

Once one of the top tourist destinations in Singapore, a modernisation is at least ten years overdue. The birds are still in too-small cages - something which may have been OK in the 1980s is not acceptable now.

Every time I saw him at the amphitheater show and heard him singing with shaky voice, I feel very pity. In addition to that, I saw two Macaws hanging at the cage net and looking outside with very pitiful faces. I can understand that they want freedom. When we saw the egret opening mouth towards the artificial tide and looking for the fish repeatedly, we decided to leave the park.Anyway, this place is good for local kids to learn about different species of birds.

Jurong Bird Park,John W,Birds in Captivity,20,22-Dec-14,"our trip to Jurong Bird Park started from City Hall MRT. Upon arrival at Boon xxx MRT we saw no obvious information on how to reach the Park. Information along the way on how to reach the Bird Park is not obviously displayed. Non-English speaking visitors would have problems. Upon stepping off the bus at the Park there is no information as to the park location. It is very close by, but again, there is no welcoming information. A walk from the bus stop to the Park entrance on a rainy day would 'dampen' the spirits of many visitors. Too many birds are imprisoned in cages that are protected with a wire mesh that also prevents the visitors from photographing the 'inmates'. Birds SHOULD NOT be kept in such enclosures. The three 'attractions' that justify some reason for holding birds in captivity are: the penguin/flamingo area, the walk-in aviary and the 'bird show', which was very entertaining and offered some educational value to advanced English language speakers. One 'bird' you should avoid is the 'Chicken Biriyani' in the restaurants close to the entrance. It was disgusting!

Jurong Bird Park,919DISAPPOINTEDGUEST,A Lovely and Colourful Bird Park,20,17-Dec-14,A must visit Bird Park as it offers you great varieties of birds that are taken care of by the Park very well.The orangy and pink Pelicans are a wonderful sight and it brings a great smile when you see them.All categories of birds are classified in separate cages.My most favourite is the 5th level whereby the birds at the Lory Loft is presented with a net above as they are let loose and for a fee of S$2 you can purchase a honey syrup cup whereby you are allowed to feed the birds and it is a great photoshoot.Watch out for their performing times as the raptors will be flying above you from the command of their trainers. Awesome!,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ec/a2/default-avatar-2020-3.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r244754580-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,Lchee2019,Bring your own food!,20,2-Sep-14,"The park itself is great with plenty to occupy both kids and adults for a good full day. My major grouse is the F&B options are limited, expensive and low quality, which pretty much spoiled our day. Not expecting gourmet food but $7.90 (SGD) for a hot dog in a bun is a rip off..as is microwave bowl of pasta with a few slices of sausage and tomato paste on top for $11-12 (SGD) and waffle with ice cream for $17 (SGD). Worse of all, there were only two miserable hotdogs left at 1 p.m. to feed my family of 4!

Jurong Bird Park,MVAJ,Be Aware Rip Off,20,1-Sep-14,"I and my daughter were visiting Singa for 3 days. We had to choose among the several offers on what to do in the city. Unfortunately, we picked this park to go in one of the afternoons. They advertise in their website that the last ticket time is sold at 5:30PM, so we planned to go on the touristic bus in the morning, have lunch and than go on to Jurong in the afternoon. We arrived at the park at 4:30. No one ever told us that the performances (shows with the birds) end up between 2:30 and 4 PM daily. We paid full price - they do not offer a discount for afternoon comers - and we did not see any show whatsoever. Most of their performances with the birds are between 10 AM and 2:30 PM. Only one of them end at 4 PM. So, we got in and started being pushed by the employees that kept saying for us to take the tram asap as the park was getting ready to be closed. Why do you guys sell tickets after 2 PM than - I asked the manager who stood there without any answer. Why don't you guys inform people about the timing of the shows or maybe give them half a price tkts for those getting in after 2:30? He was unable to answer these questions and did not offer anything to make up for our loss.Therefore, I advise you, if you decide to go, make sure you do it in the morning. If you can not go in the morning, DO NOT GO! Don't spend expensive dollars to not be able to see every attraction, or have to see it fast because the employees are pushing you saying they will close soon. For me, this was what we usually call a ripoff. Other than that, nothing special apart from the parrots that can be fed by food you can buy there.Better use of our dollars!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/c3/41/dc/marcojorge.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r225934194-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Most of the caged birds were truly 'distressed'- hope someone does take notice !Overall, we were terribly disappointed and consider the Singapore Zoo a better choice !",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/15/82/ab/7b/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r449814845-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,Wolf G,strongly advocate not to visit,10,1-Nov-16,"About 10 years ago this was a very well maintained park. But when I went there this time (2016), I was extremely disappointed. Still it is an nice experience to go into this huge bird cages and to feed the parrots. But all other installations and cages are way too small, run-down and dirty. There was a larger lake that became a stinky green swamp with a way too large crowd of Flamingos. Many cages are empty and nearly all cages are too small and dirty. It is unbearable to see the beautiful Aras, Parrots and the large birds of pray being kept in this small cages. Without going into the critical issue of zoological parks, this park particular became unacceptable. I strongly advocate not to visit the park and not to support this abuse of birds with buying a ticket.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/e0/16/a6/wolf-g.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r433394121-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,HarshModi,Bad experience at Lunch with Parrots,10,18-Oct-16,"They took my booking for a Lunch with Parrots. They closed it down for renovation without informing. They did not even refund. They converted it into a parrot show - like one of the free shows. and a separate buffet lunch. The food looked really bad. When we got to the lunch, it was closed.Also very limited eating options there. Found a burger place there but nothing beg. Vegetarians carry your own food.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/3e/d9/44/harshmodi.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r429011058-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,379shawnp,Bird Park,10,2-Apr-16,"Needlessly, outrageously expensive. Ok, I paid $80 online which is a bit cheaper, for 3 adults. Considering it is Singapore, that is par for the course I guess. But paying $60 in the Bongo Restaurant for an order of chicken nuggets, 2 orders of chicken wings and 3 ice filled drinks is over the top. Seriously, $20 fast food burger meals?

Jurong Bird Park,J Michael E,Ignore the map!,10,2-Apr-16,"Not having been here for more than thirty years, we really wanted to revisit the birds. Using the Singapore Concierge Map as a guide, we dutifully took the long ride to the end of the line, AS SUGGESTED ON THE MAP. The problem is that you can't get there from there.

Jurong Bird Park,S5331PTdavidw,Worst possible service,10,27-Dec-15,"These people need to take lessons at a well managed park! Ridiculous and unnecessary queue just to buy a ticket. 3 people working, 1 cash register in operation for the usual ticket buying family. They'd then spend endless time acting as an info center while the queue grew out to the street!Inside it's just as bad with insufficient trams running. Plan to wait....Birds and some of the exhibits are of course nice to see.Doesn't have to be like this and it's time JBP gets like the rest of Singapore and puts some planning in place!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/6f/12/11/david-w.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r335136849-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,JenniferT368,Waste of Time and Money - especially the Train!,10,11-Dec-15,"We visited on the 26th of November 2015. It cost $28 each to enter. We upgraded our entry to include the train ride around the park, this cost $33 each. I thought this was a lot of money but gave it a go anyway. Top tip of the day- train ride a waste of money! Jumped on the train, got to the next station and then was told that it was terminating. Walked up to the next stop but found that there was that many people waiting, we would've been lucky to get on the 2nd train to arrive. We were told walking the park in total would be 1.7km and that's what we did in the end. The variety of birds were disappointing - Pelicans are beautiful birds but are very common. Saw the flamingoes, saw the bird breeding program, a couple of bird enclosures and these were ok. We saw the end of the bird show and again I would rate it as just ok. Just found this park lacked variety, was too expensive and was overrated.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r331937750-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
Jurong Bird Park,Microsoft B,Small Birds,10,2-Oct-15,"So excited when I heard it's a bird park. Came all the way to see the big long dark birds with tropical jungle exoticism.

Jurong Bird Park,MiaAveda,Another disappointment,10,9-Jul-15,I feel sorry for the huge birds that are caged up and don't even have place to move around. The entry fees is so high and i dont see any comfort offered to the birds who reside here. Poor owls are put in glass cubicles which is just 300sqft.

Jurong Bird Park,JandJ68,Heartbreaking,10,17-May-15,I hated this. Absolutely hated it. Birds need horizontal space to fly as well as vertical.

Jurong Bird Park,varsha d,Waste of time !!!,10,4-Apr-15,"No doubt it was very big park but sadly couldn't spot that many birds. Won't recommend this place if you are travelling with kids or elderly people coz you have to walk too much as all the species are scattered. To mention few there were Flamingos, ostrich, penguins, eagles, vultures, hawks, colorful parrots, Ducks, swans, and a few more. Also, I didn't find anything new there as I have been to ""safari world, Bangkok"" which was way better than this. Something that disappointed me the most were the shows, I expected birds will perform some tricks or will entertain us but they just brought birds and shared some details about a few birds which was too boring... for me it was waste of time !",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/14/22/2a/e3/travelfreak2015.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r263475855-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html

Jurong Bird Park,OARA,Parents bringing kids with trollies....Not a good idea to go.,10,21-Oct-09,"I went to Jurong Bird Park in Singapore on 26 September with my wife and 3 kids. We arrived at 1130hr local time and had lunch in the restaurant. The restaurant is unique in the way that all the seats are all made of metal made into different kinds of animal figures. We entered the attraction at 1215hr and took some pictures and went to see a show. The show started at 1230hr and finished at 1300hr. We, then, went around the park and did not enjoy it at all. This is because the attraction is very not family friendly, especially for me who brought along 2 baby trollies. There are too many flight of stairs need to be taken to view the attraction close range. Although there are ramp at some of the attraction, it is not designed well in the sense that after going through the attraction, as we are going to exit, there will be another flight of stairs to negotiate. In the end, we will have to exit from where we enter. And the contour of the landscape in not friendly to us who will be pushing the trollies around the park as we need to walk uphill at one part of the park. I saw a lot of other tourist who will carry the trollies up and down to stairs, just like I did. In the end, we left the park at 1330hr which speaks volume as to how much we did not enjoy the outing.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315466-r47376424-Jurong_Bird_Park-Singapore.html
