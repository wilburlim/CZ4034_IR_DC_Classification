FOR 700 ml water bottle. disappointing for photography lovers is no tripods allow, camera allowed only no extra charge for camera. once you go up there then no tile limit for exit so enjoy fully and if you are hurry for next attractions then its your choice bcz down at garden by the bay there is night sound and light show.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r751093358-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html

Had to have temperature checks on arrival, but that's standard in most places now what with Coronavirus. Its up on 56th floor, the lift was fun! At the top we aimed to get there for sunset as then we got the views followed by the night scene with all the pretty lights. Two sides: city view and garden view (gardens by the bay view) you could see the gardens by the bay light show from up top which was amazing! Unfortunately there was some works being done so we couldnt get to the tip of the ""boat"". Luckily it was very empty ?Coronavirus caused it but we were grateful. We were then shown up to level 57 where we had a drink in the bar, but we had mixed messages as to this, someone said that was for an extra ticket holder so we dont know whether the lift guy got us confused with someone else.

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,912nicholasw,Well worth while,50,4-Feb-20,"There is a choice to make. For access to the observation deck you pay the $26 each or wave your SingaporeAir boarding passes and get 15% off each ticket. This entitles you to access to a large open deck on the 56th floor. Alternatively you can buy a pass at the ground floor for the ce la vi restaurant which entitles you to access the 57th floor restaurant and a wider, possibly more comfortable experience. This does not open till midday so we opted to go just for the observation deck. Despite some criticisms on this forum we found the view excellent, there were no queues when we arrived at 11 am and we had as much of a panorama as we wished for with views over the city, harbour, bay gardens and out to sea. Sure there were no seats or shade but there are toilets and access to drinks available to buy. You can see the infinity pool in the distance but not close up.

It was enchanting, and we spent a couple of hours supping Prosecco, surveying the Singapore sights, and talking with like minded visitors.

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,732jackiee,A taste of the high life,40,24-Mar-20,"Marina Bay Sands is the most iconic building in Singapore. It is basically a 5 star hotel and casino with a sky park and swimming pool on the roof. (Featured towards the end of the film ""Crazy Rich Asians"".) Sadly, you won't see any of this unless you are a guest at the hotel. However, the roof area has been segregated so that a small portion of it is available for tourists to ride up and admire the view. 57 floors up. A fantastic (but partially restricted) view over the city and the straits. Worth a look but very expensive for what it is.

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,Ungtbhub,Well worth a visit,40,9-Mar-20,"Although a little on the expensive side this place really is worth visiting. The views from it are amazing! If you ASK there is another floor you can access (via the lift) When you get to the top you exit the lift and turn left. When you get outside everyone turns right. If you look LEFT there is a narrow passageway, that gives access to another area where there is a bar and seating. You also get a view of the infinity pool. Don't get too excited, you can only use the pool if you are staying in the hotel. (it's not obvious so not many find it. Turn RIGHT and you get to another bar area with seating and awesome views. Just sit down BEFORE you look at the bars price list. But because of where you are you simply must have a Singapore Sling to sip whilst soaking up the view. Once you have visited the bar you cannot reypturn to the observation deck, it's the ground floor only.

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,neha341,Great view,40,10-Jan-20,"So we went there as Singapore trip is not complete without it .. but trust me it can be..It was so crowded there was no space and as seen everywhere in Singapore there was no planning or crowd management. They were giving tickets to any number of people creating a fish market and as per review and research it's the case most of times.Would suggest to book a table at CAfe la ve, you don't have to take the entry ticket of 32 SGD and can actually eat/drink something for that money.Also such a waste of paper with printing everyone's pic and trying to sell it with no luck, obviously MBS will throw all the pics which were not sold.

At 11am there was no queue and we had plenty of space on the viewing deck. The views of the city, the bay and the gardens are incredible on a clear day. However, be aware of a couple of things that other reviews have mentioned - the pool area and gardens are for hotel guests only so you'll only be able to access a relatively small part of the roof and the restaurant is for guests only. There's a small stall that sells drinks and souvenirs.

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,Thomas J,The best thing about the view is - the view! The terrace itself feels more like a cheaper cruise ship ...,40,27-Dec-19,"This is perhaps Singapore's most famous building and, not least, views! It feels like the entire hotel is created solely for this magical world of skylines, skyscrapers and eternal sky against the evening sun and stars ... Nothing to the height scared, though the railing and glass walls are reassuringly high. The view is reasonably similar no matter what part of the roof terrace you buy tickets to - the difference lies in whether you are staying as part of the hotel and can enjoy the beautiful 'eternity pool' or 'just' visit the regular view deck (which is reminiscent of a cheaper Mediterranean cruise ship ). The choice of ticket purchase also affects whether you can sit at a real serving or just buy a cheap copy of a Singapore Sling drink in a simpler kiosk. Regardless, it is worth the money, time and effort to get up here and enjoy the beautiful city - try to hit the time around sunset, when the light is at its best!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/27/ea/a4/thomas-j.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r734906671-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html

There is also food and drinks up here so no need to grab them beforehand.I'm glad I didn't pay for the attraction because I'm not sure it's worth the cost. It really depends on you though.

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,Allbreeds,Awesome but only if you don't mind heights,40,16-Dec-19,"We were on a 2 night stop over & got tickets from the hotel for the sky park and gardens by the bay . We went via the subway , which the hotel is close too.The building or 3 towers is just awesome , a real feat of architecture and engineering . The ground floor has two hotel receptions , shops and restaurants & is very busy.The skypark is at one end and wasn't that easy to find initially. Staff are on hand to guide you .We went up all 55 floors & the reception area has a toilet and photo shop.I don't like heights so was very unnerved by being so high up so had to let my hubby take in the views & take some photos. There is a small cafe selling drinks and a gift shop but there is no where to sit. Clearly they don't want you to stay up there for for too long. There is a restaurant too but on the day we went it closed at 2 pmI honestly don't know how they built this building as it is amazing but don't expect to see the famous infinity pool as this is only for hotel guests and the skypark is only one end of the top floor so don't expect to be able to walk around the whole level. The skypark area is surrounded by a tall glass barrier so is safe but you've been warned if you don't like heights think twice, I have never been so scared as I was on this trip.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/09/2d/fa/72/allbreeds.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r732832491-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,mandcadventure2019,Spectacular views over Singapore,40,10-Dec-19,"We went in the morning and so it was not so busy at the top although it became busier after a while. The views were wonderful and because you can walk around the platform you get almost 360 degree views across Singapore. The ticket only gives access to the viewing platform and not the swimming pool area which is reserved for hotel guests.You can also enjoy a frozen Singapore Sling as you look across the city.My only negative (and why I have given this 4 and not 5 stars) is that there were no places to sit and there was not much shade and so, although you can spend as long as you like there, it is not comfortable to do so.However, I would recommend this to any visitor to Singapore because it's a unique opportunity to view this beautiful city.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/41/f7/94/mandcadventure2019.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r731789085-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,jp3522,Stunning venue with OK service,40,2-Dec-19,This is a fabulous place and we had drinks at both the bars at the top of tower 1 & 3. At tower 1 it is free to go up and views are excellent. At tower 3 you pay $22 which is redeemed at the bar and their is an additional payment to enter the viewing platform which I don't think is worthwhile.Drinks in both bars are expensive as you'd imagine but still worth the visit.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/12/5a/71/e8/johnpeter2253.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r730219506-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html

You get gouged for food and drink too, so bring your own.Only one negative, there was absolutely no place to sit down, no seats at all, and no shelter from sun or rain ( the restaurant was off-limits to us when we attended) so your stay at the top will be limited by how long your legs hold out. For old people (like me!) I thought that was a bit shabby, even though it is a sneaky way for the operators to ensure people don't stay all day.Kim W, Gippsland, Australia",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2a/fd/a1/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r729357630-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,Moses P,Great Panoramic View,40,21-Nov-19,"Although it was a misty day when I visited the 'Skypark' because of Indonesia annual fire burning, I had a good view of Marina Bay and the surrounding areas including the 'Gardens by the Bay'. At this level there is no access to the bar. I would recommend paying extra and go to the bar a level higher where one can relax and enjoy the view with a drink or two specially if it a hot day. Please no not forget when buying ticket to mention that you are a senior citizen if you are. You will get discount and if you flew by Singapore Airline you get further discounts.To get access to the Skypark you must go to the Sands Hotels. The Skypark ticket office is just by the side of the hotel. While the ticket for the Bar observation area is within the corridor of the hotel. It is fairly easy to find either.Was it worth it?

I'd paid $22, on a Thursday evening, which is like a cover charge to Ce la Vi bar & restaurant on 57th floor.It was a cloudy day so I didn't get to see the beautiful sunset. The sky was somewhat light orangy and pinkish. Nevertheless, a panoramic view of the city and Marina Bay.From the 57th floor I went down to 56th floor Observation Deck for another look.

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,David D,Something to experience,40,5-Nov-19,"Wednesday 23rd October and we were on our way to the Sands Skypark Observation Deck.The observation platform is on the 56th floor and is 12,400 metres high and is located on the rooftop of one of the most recognisable and iconic buildings on Singapore's skyline.The ticket price was 23$SD, however, when purchasing our ticket we received a 15% discount because we were travelling with Singapore Airlines. The actual ticket price was 19.55 $SD, roughly 11 each.There was no time limit to the length of stay up on the platform, we spend roughly 1 hour up there.From the observation deck it is possible to see the landmarks and places of interest in Singapore. There were information boards around pointing out the sights. We were able to see, Singapore Flyer, Supertree Grove,The Quays, Science Museum, Merlion and so much more.While on the platform it was possible to climb the steps to the 57 floor for a brief higher vista. This floor had bar, restaurant and swimming pool, this was for the Sands Hotel guests and those that purchased the package. For us access to the viewing platform was good enough. There was a kiosk there which was charging 4$SD about 2.30 for a can of Coke Cola.A part from walking around admiring the views there isn't much else to do up there. It is not possible to walk all the way around the observation deck as it did not go all the way around.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1b/41/f8/1b/david-d.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r723937073-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html
Sands Skypark Observation Deck,stormyweather60,Marina Bay Sands Skypark,40,3-Nov-19,Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a great spot for cocktails though it gets very busy. Warning - make sure you buy a ticket for the to level skypark on the same level as the Marina Bay Sands pool and not a ticket which only takes you to the viewing area.

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,Richard M,Look Out,30,26-Mar-20,"Well it is certainly an amazing view. But is it worth it ? $26 for the lift to the top. They do take your photo (tourist photo similar to when boarding a cruise ship) , but that's $30. There's a photographer on the Observation deck, but again $$$. Though could be handy if travelling solo. There's a caf, but no sitting on the observation deck and very little shade and if you have been to Singapore you know how hot it gets. There's a restaurant above the Caf, however it's for hotel guest only. Though the views are amazing, sadly no view of the roof top pool.

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,881nikm,Extortionate,30,18-Mar-20,"One of the boxes which needed ticking on our wish list, but found it an anti climax. Half of the skydeck was being refurbished and was out of bounds, which meant the same amount of people were coralled into a smaller space. Getting a seat at the bar was like a bun fight, we eventually got one and waited to be served, and waited and waited. Included in the admission is a credit amount for nearly as much as the ticket itself, great at least we can have a couple of drinks. WRONG. The drink prices are extortionate, barely covering a drink each and once they then add tax and a service charge, you still end up having to have to pay a few dollars more. The view is ok, having been to the Burj Khalifa this is nothing special, especially as you can only access certain parts of the skydeck. We visited a littel earlier than expected, so had a longer wait for the sun to go down, The extra wait meant buying an extra drink each (59$ or 33).

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,Nik M,Disappointed,30,2-Mar-20,"Recently visited the Skypark as one of the things you have to do while in Singapore. We visited in the early evening, just before it got dark. Admission on the ground level of MBS was very easy, and the lift to the top only took a couple of minutes. When we reached the top, that's where it all started to unravel. The skypark was rammed, with only a limited amount of tables and chairs, which meant us loitering aroung already seated people ready to pounce if anyone left. We eventually claimed a spot, but the view was nothing more than average, which was really the case wherever you sat.The cost of admission is 26$, for which you also get a voucher for 26$ to spend at the bar. Bargain we thought until you see the bar menu. Prices, even for a beer, use up most of the 26$, but it still seems a better deal then paying 23$ for the observation deck alone. The disappointment was really the view. You are confined to a small area which doesn't give a good view of either the marina nor Gardens by the Bay.After paying an exoberant 25$ for a second beer, we left very disappointed.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r748530712-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html

There is a small kiosk on the sky deck to get water etc if you need a drink.It was slightly overcast the day we visited and extremely windy but still a great view, the view at night would be as amazing when the light shows are present which unfortunatly had been cancelled at this time due to world issues with the virus.

The viewing area is a small proportion of the total platform. The hotel pool and roof garden look nice but are out of bounds. There is a drinks outlet but nowhere to sit. This means, once you've taken in the view, there's nothing else to do. For 25$ + per person I thought it a bit of a RIP off.

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,Vinay D,"Great views, but a rip off",30,16-Jan-20,"The Marina Bay hotel is an iconic building and going to the top was a must. Unfortunately the inflexibility once up there was very disappointing.Initially we were going to purchase tickets for the viewing platform, at a cost of $26 per ticket, however we were informed that there was no seating and no shade. As it was a very hot day, we desperately needed some shade, so we opted for option 2, and that was to visit the bar on another section of the Observation deck. Prior to visiting the bar we had to purchase two drinks vouchers for $23 per drink. Once we were up there, we were told we could not sit inside the air conditioning part as this was for food. We sat outside, thankfully there was shade. We were then told the drink vouchers covered the drinks but not the tax. This cost us an additional $8.The bizarre and most frustrating thing, is we were not allowed to go to the $26 observation deck, even though they were next to each other and separated by fake moveable hedges. We were told if we wanted to visit that section we would need to go back to ground floor and purchase tickets at a cost of $26 a ticket.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r739430531-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html

After purchasing our tickets we took the lift to the skypark and were certainly not disappointed with the views of Singapore's skyline and the harbour. We then decided to have something to eat at the restaurant adjacent to the skypark, but were informed that we could not enter the restaurant from the skydeck and would have to leave the skypark via the lift and return to a different level before entering this restaurant. This seemed a little bit odd considering there was an entrance via a couple of stairs from the skydeck. We were also informed that once we left the skypark we would not be able to return. Apparently the operators of the 'Skypark' and the adjacent restaurant were not prepared to co-operate, hence the ludicrous decision to prevent people on the skydeck entering the restaurant.

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,Carolle M,"Iconic building, fabulous views.",30,6-Nov-19,"In Singapore there is much to see and of course the wonderful Marina Bay Sands Hotel looms majestically and somehow creeps into many photographs while on the ground. We were curious enough to pay the dollars to visit the Skypark but opted instead for the extra floor where we could have a drink and take in the views. It was crowded, drinks a little pricey, but certainly worthwhile for wonderful views though one had to edge around a bit see them. The Skypark deck allows more freedom of movement but then there is no place to sit. Seating only in the bar the next floor up with costs more. While up there I wished I was on the Skypark deck itself as one could move around freely while we were pretty squashed up against crowded tables on the upper level.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/26/78/3a/carolle-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r724271809-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html

When you stand at Skypark observation deck, you can have overall view of Singapore, from Marina Bay, Garden By the Bay, Ferris wheel until Singapore's port. At 9 p.m, standing at Skypark, you can see whole of musical fountain show is performed at Marina Bay. It's very nice. But there is one thing that i feel unhappy at here. Gate pass price is expensive, about 25 SGD for one person but they don't offer any complimentary drink, even one simple and cheap kind of drinks is mineral water. And they don't have any free chair for you can sit. You must sit on the floor if you don't want to stand for a long time. If you want to sit on chair, you must come in the restaurant there and pay for drinks. Price of drinks in this restaurant is more expensive than the price at the ground around Marina Bay Sand Hotel about four times.

The views are great from the deck but there isn't much else to do up there.

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,Yungmarie,360 Degees... Heavenly!,30,17-Aug-19,"My visit to this beautiful place was on my very last day. I would say, it was worth it. If you stay in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel then you should have no problem accessing the sky park or finding it. Getting to it from elsewhere, please make sure you tell the driver that you are visiting the sky park as there is a drop off for both hotel and park although you can get to it from pretty much any entrance, one puts you closer. There are signs to help you navigate to get to it. The lady at the desk/counter where we bought our tickets was very helpful. She even helped us sign up in order to get a percentage off one of our tickets. They also have staff on hand to take your photo so once you are finished with your tour, you have the option of purchasing the photo.If you are afraid of heights, then this is definitely not for you unless you want to face those fears They are pretty organized so you get up and back pretty orderly and quickly. You can stay for as long as you like. No one rushes you. Once at the top though you will feel like you don't ever want yo go back down. Being at the top for me felt like you are escaping everything, but as they say"" all good things must come to an end""The views at the top are breathtaking and beautiful. So peaceful and quiet.

The only good thing about this hotel is obviously the infinity pool at the top of MBS, as seen by the numerous tourists on the first floor buying access passes to the skypark (they cannot access the pool though, it is for guests only).The pool was great, but it wasn't like 'OMG!!!!!' great either, but maybe I set my expectations too high to begin with. It did have a nice view and food/drinks were expensive, but unless you're in the adults only pool, you won't get much peace. The other pools are filled with kids with floaties and their parents taking photos of everything.I'd recommend just purchasing the skypark access ticket instead of staying at MBS. There are higher rated infinity pools than MBS.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r695299318-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html
Sands Skypark Observation Deck,KarenA378,Expensive for what it was.,30,27-Jul-19,Not worth the money. We had a better view from our 27th floor room at the Holiday Inn Atrium.

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,Parolekar,Think before you visit,30,17-Jun-19,"When we purchase the tickets ....it is only for visiting the top floor that is 56-57 floor of the Hotel Marina Bay Sands. Undoubetly, its a masterpiece of construction.....but majority of what you see on the youtube videos or what you hear about the MBS Skypark is not accessible. The view of Singapore is amazing from here. However, it is definitely NOT WORTH the MONEY charged in this tour.If you are with family including small kids....i dont think the kids will be impressed too much. But if you are only a couple....you can spend an hour talking at those heights.Now i was also advised not to go....but i still went to quench my curiosity with the logic....that i dont want to miss this attraction.....But i can say with confidence....if you have limited Time or Budget.....skip this without any guilt...Its waste of time and money. The place looks better from Fullerton square....attend the Light and Sound Show every evening at 8:00 & 9:00 pm. Its worth it and free.

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,Roger H,A little over rated tourist jammed and hugely expensive place to visit,30,17-Jun-19,For whatever reason everyone goes to Marina bay sands and to the roof top. It reads and looks better than the actual experience. External visitors pay a hefty fee to use an escalator and get an inclusive overpriced drink. Its often crowded at the top and the space available to external visitors very limited to explore. Even for hotel guests this tends to be a sleeping factory with a large chinese population. There are so many other excellent roof top viewing spaces in Singapore that far surpase this one. Try one Altitude or a free observation at the Pinnical.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/13/b9/2b/f9/rogerhj9423uj.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r682009329-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html
Sands Skypark Observation Deck,johnsG5829AF,Underwhelming,30,17-Jun-19,"The marina bay skypark is better looking up at it than looking down from it!Looks higher from below and as it is only 56 floors high when you view from the platform you think, mmmm! The skyline isn't amazing like Shanghai for instance or the view from say, the empire state building in new York so if you've travelled a fair bit and been up some of the world's tall buildings you Mau find yourself as underwhelmed as we were. Also, you pay 23 sgd to go to viewing platform where you can buy a drink from a 'kiosk'. There is no seating area so the 'poor people' have to sit on the floor! If you pay more and queue you can go a few steps up and sit in a bar and look down on the poor people. If you can afford 500 per night for a room at the hotel you can be one of those people who feel the need to show that they are even more superior by wandering around in a white pool robe and slippers with your bathing costume on...absolutely ridiculous.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r681925273-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html
Sands Skypark Observation Deck,cl41r3,A little disappointed.,30,15-Jun-19,It is made very clear to me when i accessed the observation deck that i was not able to access the bar and restaurant. So the only things other than the view was a little souvenir desk and small snack/ drink counter. So I spent all of 10 minutes up there. The view is good. But the best view in my opinion was over the Gardens by the Bay.I guess it's a must for a visit to Singapore but not convinced it's great value for money.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/ed/10/3c/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r681530211-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,WizzyDerbyshire,To tick the box,30,11-May-19,"The Marina Bay Sands is a huge building - visible for miles it seems. It would seem wrong to visit Singapore without paying a visit to the Skypark.For what you get, it is expensive - approximately $23 (Singapore) for a ride in a lift and a view to three sides - non-hotel guests are (rightly) unable to access the iconic pool area.The view is good. But there is limited explanation of what it is you are looking at and there is no seating. We would have liked some detail about the build etc, but the whole experience seems to be about extracting the maximum amount of money for the minimum amount of effort.Are we glad we did it?Possibly.Would we do it again?Definitely not.(As an aside, we walked through the lobby of the Marina Bay Sands on the way to the Skypark entrance - the experience was akin to walking through the soulless terminal buildings of a large airport. There is no character at all.

No crowds (due to the Covid-19 downturn), and two good ticks in the boxes there.Then you leave the lift to be assailed by pushy salesmen trying to get you to buy photos of you against a view you haven't seen yet. Photos attached to some of the most tasteless tat I have seen photos attached to. The guys cannot take no for an answer....though they had to in the end.Then you get to either of the two platforms. ( I think in ordinary times it is one deck , but a good chunk of the prow is hidden behind tarpaulins, so a third of the attraction and potential views are lost). The deck is just that...a wooden deck. No seats, no signage indicating individual landmarks.There is a concession stand up there selling waht I'd call fairground food, but nowhere to sit and eat it other than the floor. (Ironically there are signs saying don't sit on the floor).Tip: If you are a big party or with kids, sure go up there but take a map with you. If yiu are a couple, book Lavo italian restaurant instead.

It is just a big wooden deck that radiates heat with no where to go to get out of the sun. I found a cubic square metre of shade (literally) by a small souvenir stall. I could see everyone on the deck felt uncomfortable in the heat, trying to find shade.

To be honest although the views are stunning we found it all pretty disappointing. The service on the top deck was the worst we saw in our whole time in Singapore and it definitely felt like they didn't care as they had our money. It took an age to order drinks and snacks. The drinks took ages to come and the snacks didn't appear. We had finished our drinks and were trying to pay (we gave up on the snacks) and they almost insisted we stay and wait for the snacks !

Sands Skypark Observation Deck,Philipat,Las Vegas style touristy crowds,20,25-Oct-18,"We had actually contemplated staying at Sands during our recent SIngapore stay but over the years, having stayed in Singapore dozens of times, we have developed our favourite hotels and decided to stay with one of them.And we are so pleased that we did, this was an awful experience! We decided that since we had never ventured to the newer parts of Marina Bay we would hop down to Sands and have quiet drink whilst taking in the view. What we found was simply awful.There is a queue for the elevator to go up and you have to pay SGD 20 pp for access. This is then deductible from drinks at the bar. We had 2 glasses of red wine, which came to $80 (that's about USD 50+ for 2 glasses of wine. You also can't access the best views by the edges because all those areas are reserved for hotel guests, as is the pool area; which is actually fair enough because if we had decided to stay here we would have expected nothing less.The place is crowded and touristy and highly reminiscent of the atmosphere in Vegas and the people it seems to attract are also the same type of people you find in Vegas, so if that's what you are looking for, go for it!! It wasn't for us and we won't be back and certainly won't stay in the hotel in favor of our regular quieter, less crowded more personal and intimate hotels, of which there are many in SIngapore. There are also many other places to have a rooftop drink with great views of the Singapore skyline.In our estimation, this place is a fad which will wear off and in the meantine represents a noisy, crowded over-priced tourist attraction.We were so pleased to get back to the peace and comfort of our regular hotel away from the tourist crowds at Sands.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/00/1a/86/dd/philipat.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r627962625-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html

We walked away without any tickets and didn't return. The lady on the reception kiosk was very abrupt and didn't encourage the purchase but discouraged. She advised that buying the ticket in advance was a waste of time in case the weather changes. I understand her point but given the weather forecast was unlikely to change that evening within a matter of three hours I'm unsure why she wouldn't encourage our purchase. She also went onto explain that unless your a resident you can't access the bar of pool. Only walk up to the front of the sky park.

Some of us decided to go up later around 9.30pm. There was no queue then.The views were great, but are of a cityscape that could be anywhere in the world. If you know Singapore, it can be interesting, but if you don't, well, you might as well be in Shanghai, Paris or Kuala Lumpur just to name a few places with tall buildings.There's a restaurant or two up there, but you need to book, as they're quite popular. Otherwise it's just selfies, photos and a kiosk selling some cold drinks. You can swim at the Infinity Pool, but you need to be a hotel guest.

The lounge was free, had amazing views of the city (better than the skypark's small area).-- I will note that to go to the Ce La Vie bar there was a dress code; something about smart casual and closed toe shoes for men. After I went to the lounge, I walked over the bar and no one even said anything, but if you indicated you wanted to go to the bar downstairs at the elevator, they looked everyone over. Anyways, I also asked a staff member where I could see the super trees, she showed me that if I went to the right after you get off the elevators on the 57th floor, that there is a little spot to look out right before the hotel guests check in for the pool.

I don't know whether we should have been guests or not but I don't think so. We waited for ages for service and kept hearing people complaining. Yes, the views were amazing but it was very posy and there was thumping Ibiza chill out music going on constantly. We are much more your colonial hotel type e.g. Raffles and Fort Canning Hotel. We wouldn't choose to stay there nor pay for the viewing platform. I would, however rather fancy a dip in the infinity pool and would have happily paid for a day pass for that but they don't do them.

No Madame you can't go there your ticket only gets you to this level. Not one seat to take a rest and my friend who has a disability was expected to stand for 1 hr to wait for the light show.

The price is not cheap and the whole place is designed to herd visitors through like cattle.Top tip: If you are planning to do the observations deck, give yourself a few hours beforehand to visit the Gardens by the Bay and then walk across to Marina Bay.Conclusion: The experience felt like I paid $23 for an elevator ride.

You will get a much better view of the city, albeit another $10 or $15 more.So do not waste your money at the Skypark.Incidentally, we live in Singapore and have stayed at the hotel, the pool is not all it is cracked up to be anyway, my wife has also visited the skypark and said it was a waste of money.We take all visitors on the Flyer, this is the best way to get a view of Singapore and pick out places of interest to visit later.Thank you.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0f/0a/96/03/david-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r737413010-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html

Go up to the bar instead!!,10,19-Dec-19,"So many people were spending money to go to the skypark when, for much better value, you can go to Ce La Vie bar on level 57! A simple question at reception revealed you can go up to this classy bar with better views for virtually the same price.Go to Tower 1 and the Ce La Vie desk on the ground level and purchase a ticket for 11 English pounds. Then go up to level 57 and you use your 11 ticket as credit at the bar for drink or food. For an extra 2 we all enjoyed a fabulous cocktail with a much better atmosphere and incredible views. For the same price there were people just walking around a plain observation deck!!! They seemed completely crazy to us! Additionally, the bar wraps around so you can wander and get various views as well as going right to the edge of the famous infinity pool.It was an amazing must-do experience in Singapore.

Beautiful panoramic views but nothing else. No information regarding the amazing build, no shade. We decided to have a cocktail in the bar. I knew we had to give our ticket over but on the understanding this would come of the drinks bill. The women looked us up and down then seated us in the middle of all the smoking area. We asked to move out of the smoking area to be told its this or go down stairs. We ordered cocktails and the bill arrived with the drinks. The waitress wanted payment before tasting. We where charged full amount with a large surcharge. I just paid in cash but she never even gave me the $9 change I was due.

You probably should go there but its not worth staying long.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0f/f5/0c/43/stevejomac.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r660838166-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html
Sands Skypark Observation Deck,MikaS655,Poor pool service,10,23-Mar-19,This maybe sounds a little thing but in this '5+star' hotel no.... We came long way and booked two nights to enjoy sunset cocktails at the rooftop pool and service has gone bad... third time here and we ordered cocktails and still water with ice.... weiter just told us to drink our water from nearby tap (wtf) Views are still nice,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r660492234-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html
Sands Skypark Observation Deck,derekm6,A bit of a ripoff.,10,22-Mar-19,You have to pay a hefty price to walk round a small observation deck with no seats. Access to the gardens and pool area is not allowed after paying a hefty price ($54 over 65's price) so you are restricted to a view only. This cost gave you a small container of weak frozen Singapore Sling.For us it was not worth the effort.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-a/02/d2/a4/bf/derekm6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d1837767-r660152484-Sands_Skypark_Observation_Deck-Singapore.html
