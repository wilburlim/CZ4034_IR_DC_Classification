National Orchid Garden,robertgaxiola,Visit early or Late,50,23-May-20,"Like any all-day breakfast, Singapore's Botanic Gardens are always worth a visit.

The National Orchid Garden is itself worth the ticket as it features some of Singapore's finest creations. Included the Vanda Miss Joaquim, this hybrid from 1893 was crowned as Singapore's national flower in 1981. Other celebrity orchids worth a mention are Elton John, Princess Dianna, Jackie Chan and Nelson Mandela.

National Orchid Garden,onhols4ever,Just stunning!,50,24-Feb-20,Tucked away in the Botanic Gardens...just behind 'the clocks'.

Cute idea! Certain nationalities made good use of them!️The shop has truly beautiful souvenirs and gifts with the iconic orchids on.....I spent far too much. Refreshments are quite dear so bring plenty of water. A tiny bottle of peach water was £6! Lime lollies from the opposite kiosk were delicious!Visit early in the day...the humidity is intense there and you need to walk a long way to see all the surrounding botanic gardens.A 'must see' on your trip!,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/49/bf/ff/onhols4ever.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d317453-r747144659-National_Orchid_Garden-Singapore.html

Inside the Orchid Garden it is much quieter, almost tranquil (because of the fee to get in), beautiful flowers and plants, little water displays and archways make peaceful and relaxing moods. Great to spend an hour or so to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Best time to go would be morning or late afternoon, middle of the day is usually just too hot.
