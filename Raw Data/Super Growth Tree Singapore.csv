Supertree Grove,Chelsea B,Amazing,50,3-Feb-21,"Whilst all the conservatories require a ticket for entry the supertree grove is free to enter and these vertical gardens are just incredible to see. What's one of the most amazing things about these supertrees are they aren't just there to look pretty but have some pretty impressive environmental features too. They collect solar energy, so they can use their own electricity and also collect rainwater, which can be used to keep the gardens watered. They also have an air filtration system within them that vents hot air and can be used to cool down the conservatories. How very clever!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1c/4d/f5/28/chelsea-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r782191000-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html

Supertree Grove,Grover R,Surreal and impressive,50,12-Oct-20,"This is another amazing feature to Gardens by the Bay. However, it was my 3rd favorite part behind the two domes. Still you do not want to miss this. This are basically man made towers the act like trees in the garden and come alive at night with lights. You will see Supertrees in many parts of the part but the concentration in the grove is the most impressive part. You simply have to see them come alive at night, neither the pictures or words can really describe. This is simply a must see activity when you are in Singapore.We did not have a change to do the walk way; however the grove is simply enough of an experience to walk through. The other good part is it is perfectly position for pictures with the Sands hotel.

I would reccommend getting there around 10 minutes before the start of the show, as there is very limited seating, that being a few benches and the low walls around the garden. We arrived just as it started and had to sit on the ground. Following the show there are some delightful gardens to walk around that are very well highlighted along the way. I would also recommend the walk back over the bridge to ( and through ) the Marina bay Sands Hotel. We travelled in by cab as we were staying in town, so the way back for us was through the hotel. A very enjoyable experience all round, and what's more, it's free from ground level. NOTE There is a charge if you want to view the show from the elevated walkway, which would ( I imagine ) give one a very different perspective.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/9a/avatar026.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r749371156-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html

Supertree Grove,Della G,Super tree Grove,50,28-Feb-20,These gigantic metallic trees soar well over 25 to 50 meters. These stellar structures are design to convert solar energy to provide air conduits to the adjacent observatories and to light up the light panels for the sound and light show each evening.

The soaring branches high up offer some shade for visitors below. The spectacular feature begins at night during the light and sound show.

They are a super modern, artistic interpretation of nature, providing awe-inspiring views from all angles and unique experiences during day and night.Go during the day to appreciate the intricate design, and everything that goes into maintaining the trees, down to the detail of all the living foliage growing up the sides. Go in the evening for a completely different experience which is a visual masterpiece complemented by the musical performances that play twice per evening.My wife and I saw the grove at day and at night, and were fortunate enough for our timing to be perfect and watch the entire show from the skyway.

Supertree Grove,David R,An unmissable work of art,50,17-Jan-20,"These structures in the Supertree Grove have become synonymous with Singapore's Marina area. There are various activities that you can do here, including a walk on a sky bridge from one tree to another one, an elevator to the top of the tallest tree in what's called 'The Observatory', and an unmissable evening lightshow called 'Garden Rhapsody' - although be prepared for massive evening crowds. The grove is surrounded by forests and interesting nooks that you should definitely take your time to explore. In all honesty though, you're not missing anything by skipping the observatory and the bridge - in fact, the view tends to be best from the ground.If you're looking to take good photos, try to find those with the best cameras and tripods loitering in odd spots. For the nighttime light show, up on a little ledge above the Food Hall is where the money shots get taken. There is no denying that this is all very touristy, but it's free to go into Gardens by the Bay and to look at the trees - don't miss this lovely feature.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0e/3b/58/fd/david-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r739600555-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html

I would recommend going both in the day and at night as they are two completely different experiences. Expect a hoard of people and phones everywhere so get there early before the masses.

Supertree Grove,Mel904,New Observatory open 2020,40,3-Jan-20,"The amazing variety of nature on display in the domes is the real highlight of the Gardens by the Bay, but while you're there, the super tree grove is worth a visit. These trees actually serve an important ecological function in the gardens.The Supertree Observatory opened on 27 December 2019. At 50 metres high it is twice the height of the Skywalk. There are both inside and outside walkways. It has great views across the Bay and towards the city, as well as of the Marina Bay Sands. If you're keen for photos, however, the views are obstructed by the supertree itself.Entry is $14, compared to $8 for the skywalk, however unlike the skywalk the tickets are not timed and you can stay up there as long as you like. It gives a good/different view of the light show at night and wasn't too crowded (although had only been open a week so may not be well known yet).

At 4pm we bought tickets for the walkway ($8). At 6pm we went back to get our assigned time. (7:40pm). We were really happy to be ON the walkway during the 7:45pm lightshow. That was really fun. We really enjoyed the light show and the views. It's something I'm glad we did once. We probably wouldn't do it again. It's definitely crowded. And trying to get food in the foodcourt right by the trees was a 2 hour wait!!!! Eat elsewhere! Food mediocre and crazy long to wait for tables and food. But we are glad we went once and spent an evening there. It feels unique. Go for the evening lights and cool architecture and the fun of walking around that whole area at night. It's a tourist attraction.

It's both on pretend and real at the same time .",40,28-Dec-19,"These illusory light trees have quickly become a symbol for the whole of Singapore. Like big trumpet mushrooms, they stand in the middle of the park at Marina Bay, just a few minutes walk from the magnificent Marina Bay Sand hotel and the magical botanical domes on the other side of the park. My first thought when I saw these fairy trees was a corresponding one (though larger and more advanced) that was present at the world exhibition in Milan that number of years ago (2015). In the evening you light up the trees in a delicious light show and you can also buy a ticket and hike up between three of the tree canopies on a long footpath, with magnificent views of the surrounding park. I liked the trees very sharply, but found the exhibition with Christmas decorations in the area felt quite unnecessary ...",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/27/ea/a4/thomas-j.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r734927056-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html

At one stage we were joined by a giant snail.The music was beautiful and the trees looked amazing as they changed colour.The show lasted about 15 minutes and was lovely, although we did feel there was scope to introduce lasers and fireworks. Unfortunately we have been spoilt by Disney shows, but it was a very pleasant experience.If you get the chance do go and see the show.

The magical trees are enormous, huge structures covered in plants, and connected by a walkway high above the ground. The night time light show is fun. Visitors simply mill around, find a seating place and sit back as darkness falls until the light show turns the great towers into magical castles of a million changing lights. There are all kinds of interesting stats for these trees, heights etc and in usual Singaporean style, all highly impressive. It is all a bit of whimsy really, but gives delight to thousands.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/26/78/3a/carolle-m.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r721467295-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html
Supertree Grove,Nigel H,Very diiferent from 6 years ago,40,25-Oct-19,"When we visited six years ago, the plants were not that far of the ground, whereas today you can see much more growth.These great trees certainly stand out and mark a focus spot in the gardens.We were not there at night, but last time the trees lit up with the night show are quite incredible.There is a new feature being built therefore one of the trees has a fence around it, which does not make for good photographs at the moment.Its also free to get in.

Supertree Grove,Wendy H,Looks great on film.,40,14-Oct-19,Sitting and waiting for the evening light show seems to take forever. Perhaps this is how the excitement wanes as the heat and lack of seating take their effect. The music is ok but it is all about the lights. They look great when recorded but seem a little lack lustre when sitting in the heat. While it may be uncomfortable the light show is one of those events where you will curse yourself for not going as well as regret it when you do go. In the end I recommend taking the plunge and seeing it. Seems a shame to travel this far and miss out. In the daytime the grove is also spectacular and a fascinating combination of art and engineering,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r718211772-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html
Supertree Grove,John G,Probably better by night,40,13-Oct-19,"These iconic 'trees' are probably one of the first things to catch your eye as you get transferred from the airport to the city. They are metallic 'trees', designed to act as support for climbing plants and to house epiphytes. The trees are stunning in themselves but when combined with all the vegetation, they are truly beautiful. I was pleased to see how high up the plant colonisation has reached and think that they can only get more beautiful as the plant life matures. There is a ""skywalk"" connecting the trees but we couldn't use it because of recent rain. I was not convinced that using the ""skywalk"" would have particularly enhanced the experience. If you have time, I am sure that it would be worth revisiting them at night, when they are illuminated.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r717906325-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html

Just a stone's throw away from Marina Bay Sands Hotels, you can see the trees and the light show.

It's located in the Marina Bay Area which is very easy to get to. You can catch a train MTR or a taxi.The artificial modern metallic tree structures are part of a huge cultivated tropical outdoor garden. They provide the necessary framework for plants to attach themselves to grow onto in any direction. At the moment these structures are not completely covered particularly towards the tree tops because it takes time for the different varieties of plant life to cover the entire area which is large as there are many trees.The plants and flowers are of a tropical nature, large, lush, colourful and robust. They are used along side of other exhibitions. In February there were many paper m√¢ch√© fish designed by various parts of the community which added to the beauty and originality of this attraction.The gardens are well maintained. You can enjoy your own picnic here or snatch some fast food just to take time to sit and admire the garden.

There is a ""showtime"" I think twice a night where the canopy is lit up - outside these times it is not lit (but the trunk is).They play random snatches of very old music with the show that feels a bit ad hoc.Many people queue up, claiming spaces on the steps and other prime spots well before the show - and once it starts it is a bit of a jostle to get a good view.I was struck by how many people watch the show through their phone - they aren't there experiencing it in person! It is much better in real life, your phone is a poor substitute for the lights.I couldn't help but think they could leverage the structures in place by having them lit up throughout the night.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/92/fc/80/emeraude8888.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r674823713-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html

We viewed the laser show from the ground.Getting out after the laser show takes some time as every one is trying to get out at the same time. There are taxi stands outside as soon as you get out.Please note that the walkway will close if there is bad weather. Even if it is not raining but overcast they will close.

But the light show itself which can be considered as the highlight of the place wasn't really that great at that time.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/09/f0/c5/ca/seonyul-g.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r553382736-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html
Supertree Grove,cherriesfan_9,A bit of pointless good fun.,30,8-Jan-18,"OK, so its a good idea to create interest in climbing plants and rainforest trees, with the added opportunity of view from the tree top height downwards. But yet again, we found ourselves asking was the, admittedly quite remarkable, engineering really enhancing our understanding of plant life, or was it merely just a bit of a gimmick?There are some outstanding views from the 25 foot high platforms, right across to the docks, and the river.To our eyes, the Supertree Grove is little more than a bit of pointless good fun made possible by a lot of investment and creating a market for it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/4e/07/7e/cherriesfan-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r552280393-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html
Supertree Grove,bryw2015,Overpriced but the night show is worth waiting for,30,4-Jan-18,"What you see in the pictures is what is there. You pay (what I believe to be) a large amount to go up an elevator and walk along a catwalk - and you've only got a limited time as there is a maximum number of people allowed up there.That said, the free night show was fantastic. Aimed towards children with its bright colours and animations, it still easily drew a thousand strong crowd of all ages.

Supertree Grove,AppleMc,Nice but a lot less impressive than advertised,30,4-Jan-18,"Worth seeing it during the day and at night, attending one of the two shows held daily. Shows consist of music playing and trees lighted up at the rhythm of famous tunes, but certainly not spectacular in comparison with available technology nowadays, including lasers, projections and fireworks shows. If you want to try the walkway, get your tickets early in the day, as they are sold out very early. The walkay closes at 09:00 PM, very early for a tourist attraction in Singapore, and this leaves lots of tourists stranded on the ground.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/a6/avatar077.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r551248230-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html

Supertree Grove,kevin c,nothing special for us,30,22-Nov-17,I guess we were spoilt as we were staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and our room looked down on this so we didn't benefit from the height of the supergrove walk. Having been to the Orchid Garden and Cloud Forest I thought the walk was expensive for what it was - you are only given 15 minutes but the views looking down on the garden are pleasant enough. The night time light show at 7.45 and 8.45 is good but overshadowed by the light show on the other side of the hotel in the marina at 8 and 9pm.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r542590771-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html

There was a waiting time of 30 minutes to go to the sky walk therefore we didn't go to that. Spent some time sitting under a super tree and it was peaceful.

Admission to the elevated walkway around the trees was closed because of the occasion, this was rather disappointing as was the show, the best bit was the synchronised drones at the end. Getting out of the place was a nightmare, pathways had been blocked by barriers and it was utter chaos trying to get a taxi, the system is shambolic with people queue jumping and useless officials trying and making a complete hash of controlling the traffic and taxis.

We made the mistake of going back for the 8:45 p.m. 'light show', which was a massive disappointment. For barely 15 minutes, a light is projected on to the trunks of the Supertrees, making colours appear but not in a particularly interesting way. For some reason we assumed the skeletal 'branches' of the Supertrees would light up or there would be laser beams or something, but it's all very dull. What's worse, the venue was very crowded with thousands of other punters, many of whom (like us) cried out in dismay when the 'show' ended (i.e. as if to say 'is that all?'). Then, when you fight you way back down to Bayfront MRT station, you will be forced to queue for MRT tickets unless you have a prepaid pass. It really isn't worth it.

Also if you want to see how the how totalitarian regimes are starting, visit Singapore.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/16/70/0f/de/9jirkak.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r708426503-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html
Supertree Grove,RiskyFrisky,Waste of Money,10,23-Apr-19,"Disappointing and objectionable to even have a show in the evening, concept is great of the Grove but thats about all. Mis informed by the ticketing kiosk to the wrong location of the show after waiting in another area for over an hour. Bad experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/5f/avatar037.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r668638629-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html
Supertree Grove,hunglow,not good,10,20-Dec-18,i did not go up for the simple reason and I think it is wrong that you are required to pay to enter some christmas display. also they wont sell you the ticket for the christmas display at main counter. seems a bit convoluted forcing people to pay for something they dont want. I chose not to go for that reason. they are neat to look at from below and at night they come alive with light which make them that more interesting. i suspect you would get good views of the area from them.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/a7/default-avatar-2020-44.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r640606068-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html
Supertree Grove,Alavotre,Good from far at night,10,24-Nov-18,"Quite boring during the day, and starting to look old. It looks pretty with the lights on at night from a distance. Paying to go on top of the tree (the restaurant and bar) is definitely not worth it, because the trees are built in a depression, it's not impressive. The bar at the top is derelict and not in use. Better spend money to good to the sands hotel...",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/73/c1/56/alavotre.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d8634325-r635364818-Supertree_Grove-Singapore.html
