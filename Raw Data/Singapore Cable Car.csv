You can see the whole Sentosa Island from the Top, especially Universal Studios (one of the attractions of Sentosa Island). I just love the ride. It is of around 5-7 minutes ride but it's amazing.

Singapore Cable Car,KJJ1901,Throughly enjoyable,50,9-May-20,"We had to get a taxi to the top of Mount Faber to the cable car station, it was a little busy but in hardly any time we had purchased our tickets and ascended to the platform to hop aboard.My partner is GREAT with heights so had a bit of a panic when aboard the car. It was very entertaining to watch and we laugh about it now but if you or anyone you're travelling with has a fear of heights I would give these a miss.The journey was smooth and we got spectacular views of the harbour and a completely different view to the city.At the half way point some more people got onto our car but there was plenty of room and it didn't feel intrusive.In total it lasted about 10-15 minutes from the starting point of Mount Faber to our destination of Sentosa Island",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1b/50/1f/c6/kjj1901.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r753382530-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html
Singapore Cable Car,Grover R,Sometimes the Best attraction is enjoying the ride,50,10-Apr-20,"For our last day, I had planned to visit Sentosa. While there are a couple of way to get there the best is the cable car. It is easy to get to using the subway, you simply take a short walk way that connects the buildings. However, don't forget to take a full ride and go to Mt. Faber as well. While both Sentosa and Mt. Faber are great attractions on their own but taking the cable car is a great attraction as well. One way you get great views of the Southern Ridges of Singapore. The other way you have an amazing view of Sentosa and the open water. Both ways you get an incredible look at the cruise port and downtown Singapore.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/c0/f9/55/grover-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r752442888-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,Fanfloui,Cable car runs even during storms!,50,23-Dec-19,"There are two lines of cable car, one from the mainland to Sentosa Island and one which takes you around the Island.

We were somewhat alarmed as on arriving at Mount Faber it began to thunder and lighten, however we were told that it was perfectly safe and the weather made for some dramatic photos.Once on the island we explored the various attractions on offer including the Universal Studios park and the Madame Toussauds exhibition. We did not go in but continued our cable car tour around the island, again with stunning views of both the islands attractions and the Singapore harbour.One interesting feature of the cable car is that you can book a dinner on it.

Singapore Cable Car,LaTravellingAmbivert,A must do for aerial views,50,18-Sep-19,"There are many ways to get over to Sentosa Island, but for those of you who love an aerial view, I highly recommend taking the cable cars.I'm slightly kicking myself for not taking them during the day. But, it's not all bad, as I had the chance to literally watch the sun set over a nation. As you can see, the photos captured were reward enough!I believe that I made it to Harbour Front station at approximately 6pm. I was given a discounted rate at the ticket office due to riding at an 'off-peak' or later time. I will say that the entrance to the ticket office and lifts to the cars from Harbour Front Tower 2 are quite confusing if you don't know where to go and are dependent on following the signs/ Google Maps. I did quite a bit of walking around for approximately 20 minutes before I arrived, but perhaps that's because I kept getting lost!I took the full roundtrip from Harbour Front to Sentosa, Sentosa to Faber Peak, and Faber Peak back down to Harbour Front to experience the full journey.

Singapore Cable Car,Kirsty C,Great views of Singapore,50,26-Jul-19,I read a blog prior which recommended catching the cable car from the harbour front up to mount Faber to have a look around and then go across to Sentosa Island. This worked really well so would definitely recommend this route.Don't miss Faber peak views and the toilet with one of the best views in the world (in the cable car building). Once on Sentosa there is a further set of cable cars included in the ticket price. These give great views over the island.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r692669383-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,BigChrisKenney,Truly beautiful views,50,22-Jul-19,"I went from the beach to Mount Farber in 40 min.There are two tracks for the cable cars. I took both. It is a good and fast way to get the the big southern island. It is common to see the locals use it as well. Te full day trip price is 35SGD, but for just 4 extra dollars, you can get a year round pass. It is just super hard to get that pass. Great views of southern Singapore.To get the pass, you have to go back to the station that you bought your ticket from, then tell them you want to pay for a year pass. They will instruct you to go to a website then you have to wait two weeks for confirmation and I stopped there.You can get a family pass as well.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/7e/31/a2/christianph461fe.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r691586379-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

You feel safe inside the large cars and they run smoothly. We alighted from Faber Peak and enjoyed the ride right through to Sentosa Island. We travelled over the top of two cruise ships last time and you get a birds eye view of some of the activities happening on Sentosa Island. There was no waiting to buy tickets and a small line to get on which moved quickly.

I took a taxi and fell in love with the area.The booking office was really helpful, explaining you can get off at a stop, and also encouraged me to go to Santosa to extend my cable car journey. So glad that I did!Even from the ladies washroom, the scene is magnificent and gave me more courage to see more. I went mid-morning when it was quiet and had a cable car to myself. When I first set off, I held onto the side of the chair, and then let go and looked beneath me and all around to such beauty. I stoped off at Santosa, got another cable car to the end of the line, and spent the afternoon at the beach, and had a lovely meal. Then go the connection back.

Singapore Cable Car,srikanthav94,Wonderful experince,50,6-Jul-19,An amazing experience. You can get beautiful aerial views of the city and Sentosa Island. If you time it well you can get both day and night views. You can also go to Mount Faber Park to get good city views from the heights. I took a one day sky pass which allows you to board and get down at each station on both the lines once. To get city views travel on Mt.Faber line. To get views of Sentosa and its beaches travel on Sentosa line. I would suggest to travel on both since both cable cars and the views you get are different.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/16/75/c1/03/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r687117280-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

We opted to take the ride around late afternoon so we can get the view of the sunset and a bit of night lights. I also advise to go around this time as the cable car can get a bit hot inside during the day since it's not air conditioned. If you are a group of just 2 or 3, you may get to be joined into another group since I think it has a capacity of up to 6-8 people?

The cars are spotless and comfortable enough for the fifteen minute ride.The view is absolutely outstanding and I would think you might spend most of the trip taking pictures.The terminal on Sentosa Island gives you further travel options to get around the island, making it easy to do so.One thing to remember is on the return journey, if you are going to catch a taxi to proceed further, it is better to get off at the Harbour Front station and not the Mount Faber. This is because Harbour Front has access to a taxi rank and an MRT station, whereas if you get off at Mt Faber, you will have to call your own taxi as there is no cab rank there.All in all a great experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r684864665-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,Toffee A,Great way to travel to Sentosa,50,21-Apr-19,"I used the Weekend Go Where app to book discounted tickets for the Sentosa and Mount Faber Lines, which I collected at Harbourfront, Tower 2. The views from the cars were fantastic. An excellent way to cover the island of Sentosa, and more enjoyable than taking the Sentosa Express from Harbourfront.* If the queues are long at any of the cable car stations you may not get a car to yourself. We started our journey at Harbourfront. The queue was long and our group of 4 had to share with another group of 4. Not as enjoyable when you don't have the car to yourself.*",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/14/b3/23/2a/scallywagme35.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r667965271-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html
Singapore Cable Car,mo_aiguille,Very good,50,20-Apr-19,Definitely worth trying. I went for the package deal with entrance to Sea aquarium.

There are great views and good pics that can be taken while on the cable car. I was lucky and twice had an empty car to myself. So didn't have to make people feel uncomfortable with my pics.The cable cars are quite frequent and you don't have to wait for long.Definitely recommend,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/7e/02/59/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r667827156-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,Aryan2007,Very good 10-15 minutes ride to Sentosa island !!!,50,2-Apr-19,The Singapore cable car is one of the probably best ways to travel between Faber Peak and Sentosa Island. It was established way back in 1974. It is Singapore's first and only cableway. The cable car ride is one of the highlights for any tourist coming to Singapor. There are more than 100 cabins spanning across 5 kms on the Mount Faber Line and the Sentosa Line. A joyride on the Cable Car offers one of the best 360 degrees aerial view of the entire Sentosa island and the resort. It operates from 8.45am to 10pm.

You're greeted by friendly staff, who explain how the evening will work. Then you are offered a drink to start off with, we went for champagne. You have a car to yourself and start off with the first 2 courses. We opted for the non-vegetarian option. Our starters were mushroom soup and slices of duck. Each circle of the loop is 30mins. When you get back to the beginning, the waiters are waiting with the next course and your choice of wine. We had beef and vegetables. The beef was melt-in-the mouth tender and the vegetables crunchy. To my liking anyway. The meal was delivered hot. The last course, i have no idea what it was but boy it was enjoyable. The whole experience takes 90mins. Three loops in all. Highly recommend this dinner. The food is very enjoyable and the staff very friendly. You are given an evaluation form to fill in. That easy to do and my only comment was on how to improve the experience. That was to start the trip at 6.30pm, so you could have the last loop seeing the sites in the dark. It was lovely to see the sun going down. The views were great but not the best of Singapore.

Singapore Cable Car,JJ E,EXHILARATING EXPERIENCE. A MUST DO.,50,24-Feb-19,During our stay in Singapore we went on the Cable Car which took us to Mount Faber and especially Santosa Island.We purchased the $55 dollar special deal. This gave us unlimited rides and entry to two Attractions. In the cable car you had the best views of this area you would want to see.Just breathtaking views and overall a photographers delight. I know i took over 100 photos and some videos.There is even a massive waterpak as one of the attractions.There are far too many to list.We went to the Butterfly Exhibit and this was wonderful. Highly Recommended. They even have bugs from giant rhino bugs right down to deadly spiders alive and on display. The scorpions made me look twice. All sizes and shapes.The second exhibit was the Massive Merlion. A three minute video on his history than in and up you go in the lift to the 10th floor gives you access to the lookout on his head and the lookout in his mouth. Stunning views and photo opportunities from both lookouts.This is Highly Recommended.The entry tickets also allow you to ride the Mono Rail between different locations.Overall this RIDE IS A MUST DO AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r654478839-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,chephrenchua,"Slow but fun way to get into sentosa, great for kids",50,14-Oct-18,"If you are expecting to ride on the cable car at least 2 times within a year, join the annual membership, it's cheaper than 1 round trip ticket. I joined as member because my kids love the ride, enjoyed the view even after riding so many times. Try to avoid HOT SUNNY day, the cable car can be a bit stuffy. AND avoid thundery lightning day, they close the service for safety concern. Best time to ride is evening and if you can get the timing right, hop on around 8pm, you get to see fireworks from the nearby universal studio entrance.There are 2 cable car system, so if you are annual member, you ride both for free, and the car entrance to sentosa is free too. Try both cable car, the one within the island is shorter and only 3 stations, only if you are going to the beach will this make it worth the trip. If you go during day time, you see people playing the zip line across below the cable car screaming...If there is no crowd, the staff are nice enough to allow you or your group into one cable car by themselves, no need to share and your kids can scream all they want.Lastly, have a great dining experience on top of mount faber, the other side of the cable car station, the western food is delicious, service is great and the view is wonderful, cool and romantic.Nice toilet by the way, see thru glass to the cable car outside while washing your hands.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/e5/56/17/chephrenchua.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r624670395-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

We got on at Harbourfront station and went to Mount Faber where you can get off and look around, however we we chose to stay on and travel back through Harbourfront, where the line travels through the building and over the Harbour. We had fantastic views from the cabin. At Sentosa you transfer to another line with three stations. There are activities at each station. The ticket we purchased meant we could only get on and off at each station once and we finished where we started,. Tickets were S35 adult and S$25 which I think is great value given you can have a full days entertainment. There is plenty to do on Sentosa.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r623938033-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,Niri A,What an experience,50,4-Oct-18,"We tossed around the idea of going to Sentosa island on the cable cars as we had been to Sentosa Universal Studios & the Aquarium before but had never used the cable cars.Lucky we did because it was a bit scary at first but fantastic experience to get a 360 degree view of parts of Singapore, the harbour & Sentosa.For the $35 you not only get a ride to the island & back but you also get a ride on the cable car on Sentosa. This too is a great experience as you ride high above the lush green canopy & view parts of the island & outer harbour.Have lunch & a stroll around the island & get back on the cable car to take you home.Can't recommend it more.

Sentosa is a holiday resort and has loads to do. I braved the zip slide where the drive to the top of the hill was nearly as adrenalin draining as the zip slide itself. The slide is over in no time.

It is the heavier customer that speeds down the sip slide",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r591279663-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Well worth buying the roundtrip ticket as the views from the car are both sensational day & night.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/3f/ce/b7/martynr164.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r574649446-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,943jimmyn,Cool,50,16-Apr-18,Although a little pricey its a trip you need to do at least once to get to Sentosa.

The view is fantastic and great pictures of the harbor and city can be taken we paid for a round trip and it was worth it. You can take the next cable car down to Sentosa beach. They have a little ice cream outlet at the station serving coconut ice cream that is to die for. It i served in a coconut shell. We had planned on going zip lining but upon seeing that they did not have helmets for the customers we changed our minds.

Singapore Cable Car,Wendy W,Good experience,50,1-Apr-18,"It was easy to redeem our voucher that was included in Singapore Airlines Explorer Pass that we bought. With this pass we got to take the cable car from, 109 Mount Faber Road. You get on at Mount Faber, it take you to another stop which you can get off or stay on to continue to Sentosa. It is worth taking it from Mount Faber because you get to see two sets of scenery. The scenery is over the waters and it is beautiful! We took the cable car around 5:30pm the sun was starting to set and it was great! There is no air conditioning, it is open air, the doors have large slits to let in the air from outside. Note: It is free to take the tram out from Sentosa, it takes you to Vivo, a large mall, go down two escalators to the public transportation area. While at Vivo, you can go to Irvins which is in Basement 1 or 2, to buy Salted Egg Potato chips, casava chips, or fried fish skins...super yummy!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r569935296-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,yihleong,A great way to see Sentosa and Harbourfront on a sunny day,50,24-Mar-18,"Weather was good today, made a on the spot decision (ËØ¥Ëµ∞Â∞±Ëµ∞) to take a taxi ride to Mount Faber Cable Car Station. It was almost 3 years since our last ride when we were back to Singapore for a month. The queue was not long even though it is on a Saturday. Nevertheless, it is still the most expensive way to enter Sentosa.Initially a little apprehensive about riding in the sky (great heights), both kids got over their fear and loved the ride a lot. For us parents, it is a joy to see their happy faces.For residents in Singapore, suggest that you can consider getting an annual membership (SGD 39 per individual and SGD 135 for a family of four), taking a ride every quarter will more than pay for your membership fee.Looking forward to another cable car ride with my kids in the next few weeks.

Singapore Cable Car,annettelaurie,A Great way to look around,50,6-Mar-18,"Mount Faber cable car 'ì A great way to look around. We arrived in Singapore late at night and so took the next day to travel by MRT to Mount Faber Park and its cable cars. Just take the MRT to The Harbourfront. The tickets are surprisingly cheap, especially when doubled up with the Sentosa Island ticket 'ì a steal at S$22 each or about ¬£12 each. The cable cars go really high up the mountain to a restaurant and some shops and offer some fantastic views both of the docks and waterfront and across to Sentosa and Singapore in the other direction. They are incredibly smooth cables 'ì no rocking or jolting, and like everything in Singapore 'ì very, very clean.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/12/41/2f/9c/annettelaurie.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r564777879-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

When the iPad was handed in to the shop Princess went to where there was wifi reception, contacted two of my Facebook Messenger contacts and the second one (in Australia) phoned my wife to say where the iPad was.

I bought a ticket in another website that starts with the letter ""K"" and it was worth it. I do not know if I can put the name of the website here but you can just search it, it sounds like a cook, five-letter word, starting and ending with the letter ""K"".The promo tickets were worth it. We were able to ride both the Mt. Faber line and the Sentosa line. We started from Harbourfront MRT station towards Sentosa. From Sentosa, we took a round trip in the Sentosa line. Then we went back to Mt. Faber for our lunch since the promo tickets that I bought had a lunch included in it. After our lunch, we went back to Harbourfront again using the tickets.It was really a very wonderful experience. It will conquer your fear of traveling via cable car and think it was a first time experience. Also, the cable car can accommodate 8 people and we are 6 adults and 1 infant so most of the time, we had the cable car for ourselves.

Singapore Cable Car,CzarEmmanuel,Exciting way to get to Sentosa!,50,8-Feb-18,"Taking the cable car from Faber Peak is just one way of reaching Sentosa Island in Singapore. One may also take the MRT train or go by car. But I would recommend taking this cable car because of the scenic view it offers along the way. The ride is much shorter compared to the crystal cable car ride from Tung Chung to Launtau in Hong Kong, but exciting just the same. From the cable car, you can get a good view of Harbourfront Bay below.A one-way ride from Faber Peak to Sentosa would cost you SG$29 (for adults). To do this, you take the Faber line (30mins), which connects with the Sentosa line from Merlion Station to Siloso Point Station (15mins). I would advise that you take the combined Mount Faber line and Sentosa line for SG$33 instead of having to buy separately for the two lines (which would cost you SG$42).

Singapore Cable Car,aycs,Fun for the kids,40,12-Oct-19,"We decided to take the cable car from Harborfront to Sentosa only, but as the price included a return trip, we ended up taking the cable car back off the island.To get there, you need to walk through Harborfront shopping complex, which is right next to Vivo City. You walk past the area where the cruise passengers disembark and follow the signs outside into the next building, where the cable cars are located.It's very peaceful up above the harbor and island as the cable car rolls along. You do hear the odd clank or grind as it rolls along and it does sway a little when the wind picks up.The views are fantastic - you can see very far on either side of the harbour and you also get a great view of most of the island and it's resorts as you fly over.The trip takes less than 10 minutes and drops you off at the gift shop on the island.When you purchase your cable car tickets (or monorail ticket from Sentosa Express) you can purchase tickets for all the activities on Sentosa and it gives you slight discounts on each ticket as you combine more and more.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/66/bc/83/aycs.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r717500192-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,samareaiya,Nice experience/ Worth trying,40,25-Sep-19,Try the cable car from city to Sentosa Island. No trafic not much of a waiting time. It was worth the price. They'll take your photo and try to sell it from the other side. It is really common in Sentosa Island. It is just a way of income so we have to accept it. Don't forget to cover the full route on cable car. Ask from someone there where you can travel with the ticket you have. You can go to Sentosa and also to the other side on of the island on the same ticket and return to where you started in most of the cases.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r712879388-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Buy the round trip ticket and it includes the second cable car ride to Siloso point.

I'd say it was worth the price, as the views were quite good, even though not as impressive as you can get at the bay. Still not bad at all. Stations are located in strategic points from which you can walk around and explore the area. I'd say cabins are a bit dated, and windows start to hinder photo opportunities, and in general they feel a bit too closed to truly enjoy the surroundings. Nevertheless, it's fun!Keep in mind that if you are taking it from the Mt Faber station (and returning there), then be sure you can call up a taxi (or know your bus routes), otherwise transport there is a bit scarce...

The views from the Mount Faber to Harbourfront are amazing and so are the views from Harbourfront to Sentosa station.Between the Harbourfront and Sentosa, the car goes to its highest point that provides a nice birds eye view of the entire Sentosa Island. From here, you can see the Universal Studios, Water park, Merlion, etc. This is the best part of the rideThe other line (Imbiah - Sentosa - Siloso) offers an excellent view of the beach side of the Sentosa Island. It is a good way to go to the Siloso point and Siloso Fort.Overall, the ride itself is enjoyable, but for many the cost would be a deal breaker.One way takes about 20 minutes (Mount Faber to Sentosa) and 10 minutes (Imbiah to Siloso)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/d3/a6/2e/nandan-rao.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r670628683-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,mohitkkapoor,Mt. Faber cable car towards sentosa,40,31-Dec-18,I will rate this experience as good and one time experience. For this you also have a waiting time of around 45 minutes. You can save that time by going through road as well. But if you want to enjoy the scenic view of sentosa and it's neighbourhood you can take one way cable car. It is hardly of 10-15 minutes ride but you could be able to see many beautiful things from this ride,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/15/e2/7a/3f/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r642563209-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Got bird's-eye view of entire Sentosa and key attractions of Singapore. I suggest one should take 4 way cable car route instead of 2 ways. Ideally one should visit around 5-5.30pm. So one can visit part of cable car in day time and partly after sunset and get both day and night view. I did same. As view from cable car was very good I skipped Singapore flyer. Only negative feedback was, we were asked to change cable car in middle of trip as staff wanted to use our cable car for candle lite dinner for other couple. We had to take out our kids, stroller and luggage from one cable car and rushed to another cable car. It dampened our overall experience.

Singapore Cable Car,Wanderer372044,Singapore Cable Car,40,21-Nov-18,Excellent!! You get a round ticket for around $25 then can get on and off at each station once. Closest MRT is Harbour Front. Plenty to see for free or plenty of adventures to be had for $$.NB: Don't buy electronic tickets as you have to them redeem them at the ticket window for a paper ticket anyway. I purchased mine through here (Viator/Trip Advisor) however the ticket office didn't recognise the barcode. I had to ring Viator and request for a different form of barcode.

Singapore Cable Car,AbhimanyuSinghi,A One Time Must Do,40,19-Sep-18,There are some things that you must experience once and thats that. The Cable Car is worth that one experience even if it is just a 10 minute ride with a waiting time of 10-15 minutes or worse if there are large tour groups at the same time as you. The best way to do it is to take a one way ride from Mount Faber Station to Sentosa Station or beyond. That ensure that you fly over the harbour and enter into Sentosa which is the most scenic part of the ride. It also means that you cross at least one stop and get sufficient time on the ride.The cable car moves at a fairly slow and even pace. Those afraid of heights might feel uncomfortable especially while looking down. But my 3 year old son could handle it so it shouldn't pose too much of a risk to anyone. A one way ride is enough - you do want to see the harbour sights and also the Sentosa attraction from above. A return ride may not be very enjoyable as you would be moving upwards instead of downwards.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/04/53/35/abhimanyu-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r617932010-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,DocMCG,Nice Views. Shop around for tickets.,40,25-Aug-18,"If you haven't done a cabe car before, this is well worth the experience. We were staying on Sentosa, so thought this was a good option for getting off the island, and having a look around the city. We bought our tickets online, only an hour before we boarded, and got round-trip tickets (2 adults, and a child), for S$62. That was round-trip for both lines.There are two lines, the Faber line takes you from Sentosa over to Mt Faber and back. The other line focuses on Sentosa itself, with some sightseeing across the island. Other reviewers will tell you that if you require to get back to Singapore CBD by taxi, it's best to alight at Harbourfront Station. That was our plan - we originally planned to go to Mt Faber, have a look around, and then go back to Harbourfront to get a taxi, however a bus load of tourists arrived at the wrong time, and the lines to get back on at Faber were huge, so we called a taxi (Grab taxi), and they picked us up from Mt Faber in a couple of minutes, and was only S$11 to get into Lau Pa Sat market.There isn't any audio in the cable cars to tell you exactly what you are looking towards, so we just made up our own stories. The cable car seats 6-8 people, and is safe, and doesn't sway like other cable cars I've been on.The experience is open from 8:45 AM to 10 PM.

The price drops after 6pm for those watching their budget, though personally I think going up via cable car at 5pm would be perfect. When you get to the top, get out of the tourist complex and head towards Henderson Waves Bridge, and then spend a couple of hours wandering through the tracks and pedestrian walkways at the top and watch the sunlight fade and Singapore's lights come on, while meandering through both National Park tracks and formal gardens, Do the former before the light fades; these don't have street lamps and are more interesting when you can still see the birds and other wildlife.

Singapore Cable Car,tranzactnow,An enjoyable ride,40,22-Jul-18,The cable car ride especially if you make use of one of the many discounts available on many sites makes for an enjoyable way to get a birds eye view of the mainland across to Sentosa Island.

Singapore Cable Car,vasavapr,A Different View of Singapore,40,15-Jul-18,"Tickets: We bought a Universal Studio+Aquarium+Cable Car combination ticket online. Buying tickets online beforehand did not help skip the queue. We had to stand in the same line as everyone else (who are buying tickets) to redeem tickets/vouchers. In fact we felt that people buying tickets on the counter got better bargain/discounts and free gifts while we just got a paper version of our tickets redeemed.Directions: While arriving from VivoCity we found directions to the starting point bit tricky. It also involved significant walking while we had to keep an eye on the signage.Review: The cable cars are one of three transport options to get to the Sentosa island. The cable cars were clean and at all the stops the cars came quite frequently. We never had to wait more than 30 seconds for a ride. So it's safe, fast, efficient, the views are pleasant and unlike monorail it does not get crowded. The cable car also goes to Siloso point which otherwise can only be reached by taxi or on foot.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/12/da/96/93/vasavapr.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r596296002-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

We were glad we paid the extra $2 each as that saved us a lot of walking in the heat up to Siloso fort and back again. Recommend as a different way to travel across to Sentosa.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/14/26/8d/1d/damelza-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r580005949-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

We tried Adventure Cove Waterpark , Skyline Luge, Sentosa Merlion.We tried Skyline Luge for 3 times. This is karting, so I recommend wearing shorts.Adventure Cove Waterpark is a place where you float on inflatable ringand then you get into the fish tunnel.Sentosa Merlion is a Symbol of Singapore.

Singapore Cable Car,Car0le88,Good views and plenty of rides!,40,19-Feb-18,"We caught the MRT to Harbourfront and booked tickets on the cable car to Sentosa. What we didn't realise was that you get a ride up to Mount Faber Peak as well, and for a bit extra can include the Sentosa cable car. I have to admit I don't like heights but it is something I have to do! I didn't like going up to Mount Faber Peak up over the road and valley but got used to it. We had a drink in the cafe at the top (make sure you get your change!! A lot of Americans visit this cafe early on as the cable car is close to the cruise terminal, and I think that maybe it is thought we don't count our change)We then rode all the way down to Sentosa, which was fun going over the top of the cruise ships! At Sentosa we caught the Sentosa Island cable car both to Merlion and Siloso Point beach. A fascinating island - one end a bit like Disney, and the other end a quiet beach (though it does have a zip wire going over it at one point)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/08/43/5d/e8/car0le88.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r561404813-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

There is room for up to 8 people in the cable car, yet it wasn't too busy when we were there & we usually shared with another couple or a single traveller. Views are great & it's nice to peacefully go far above the hustle & bustle below. On Sentosa, be prepared to be fleeced.

Singapore Cable Car,SameerKarkhanis,Great Experience,40,6-Jan-18,"The Cable car has 2 routes or lines - The Sentosa Line and the Mount Faber Line. The Sentosa line only takes you within the island of Sentosa, while the Mt. Faber line connects the mainland to Sentosa. We had a combined pass of both the lines. We took a cab to the Mt. Faber station, which overlooks the whole city and provides a nice view. A 15 minute ride, going over the hills, the marina and the sea, catching glimpses of the cityscape brought us to Sentosa.The Mt. Faber line starts from a hill called Mt . Faber on the mainland and takes you over the city and into the island of Sentosa. You get great views of the city and the skyline. Being a family of 4, we had the whole car to ourselves and my kids really enjoyed the view from the top and the 15 min journey. The cars have openings to let the air in and also glass windows. Interestingly when we were coming back, it started to rain and made the whole trip quite interesting with droplets of water coming. The trip also takes you over the harbour, where you can see ships docked in Singapore. If you are lucky, you might even glimpse a nice cruise liner right under your feet as you pass by !!!We used the Sentosa line just for fun, seeing the Merlion from up in the air, seeing the shoreline and the beach etc. However one may choose to avoid it totally.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r551990820-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,Jake G,Lovely Views!,40,19-Nov-17,"My fiancee and I spent the weekend in Singapore in October. She wanted to see a new country, and I wanted to take her to a romantic location to propose. :) When she first saw the Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa line) running near the Hard Rock Hotel on Sentosa Island, her eyes flew open wide and she said, ""WE HAVE TO RIDE THAT!!!"" I was happy to oblige and eager to ride it myself.The Singapore Cable Car has 2 lines, the Sentosa line that takes you along Sentosa Island and connects you to the second line, the Mount Faber line, which takes you off the island and to the top of Mount Faber. There are several stations per line that allow you to disembark or to connect to the other line. We used our round-trip ticket to get us off Sentosa (where we caught a taxi and went downtown), and later to return us to Sentosa at sunset.The view is spectacular...ESPECIALLY at sunset!!!Prices weren't cheap, but they weren't that expensive either. Depending on the time of day that you ride, you may get lucky and get your own car, but be prepared to share it with other groups...a ticket on the Singapore Cable Car doesn't guarantee you your own car. Each car holds 8-10 people, depending on how full they want to fill it. Cars move at a brisk pace and can sway a little if you move around or the winds are blowing. Those who have a fear of heights may want to pass on this experience.We took many memorable pictures and had a wonderful time cuddling in our car at sunset as we returned to the Sentosa line from Mount Faber, and later as we rode the entire Sentosa line after dark to take us back to the beginning of the Sentosa line near the Sentosa Merlion. We do not regret riding and would gladly go again if we ever find ourselves in Singapore once more. Our only gripe is that we wish it would have been longer. I realize that building something of that scale is absurdly expensive, but we wished there had been a 3rd line to take us deeper into the city.Ride away and enjoy the views!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/06/default-avatar-2020-18.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r541886815-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,Christian S,"Good way to explore sentosa for tourist, for frequent user (e.g., more than 3x a year), consider Faber license",40,8-Nov-17,"Cable car ride from Harbor front -> Mount Faber -> Harbor front -> Sentosa isle then followed by Imbiah station -> Merlion station -> Imbiah station -> Beach station -> Imbiah station.REMEMBER: if you like me and plan to visit and go around Sentosa or even universal studio for more than 3 times a year, then better get the FABER LICENSE pass -> allows you for unlimited use of the cable car AND the sentosa express train for 1 year (i got the family deal which allows me to give 4 people the license). It was 139 SGD for the whole family (110 SGD if renewal from Islander card)I like to bring friends or family or relatives to cable car trip in Sentosa so, this card is no brainer. I can get discount when buying ticket for them too (50% sky pass ticket)Within the 3rd visit to the isle using cable cars you have earned back your investment already compared to others who use single day pass or 1 trip pass etc.Like best: ease of use for traveling in Sentosa, beautiful view. Safe for children and not scary since it is encapsuled.Bring camera, selfie stick.Sit in balanced manner (e.g., not all passengers in one side)Come when it is not busy day/time so you can have the whole carriage for yourself.

I took this a part of the itinerary due to family members first time experience. The ride still brings fun and thrill to me so i suggest make this part of your tour as well.we take the sky pass back-and -forth ticket which is just enough i guess to visit anywhere in Sentosa and in Faber mountain. This is about 5-10 dollar cheaper than unlimited ride. Honestly, we did not take cable car from Merlion Station back to Imbiah look out since it is just literally few steps away :).

The attendants were all quite pleasant and as there was a cruise ship in port it was lovely gliding over the top of this. We certainly got our monies worth. In between stations we hopped on the transit (FREE) down to Sentosa, so we could get the cable car back.The best bit was , as it was not overly busy we had the cable car to ourselves, so you can stand where you like to get photos.Its surprising what you can see from the air, a lot more than you could possibly see from the ground.

I understand that it might be something special in a city which does not feature any real mountains. However the cable car itself was not something spectacular to me.What however was sensational, were the views that can be experienced on the way to Santosa Island.

Singapore Cable Car,Crogglepop,Don't forget to explore Mount Faber,40,13-Oct-17,"Before I got to SG I knew I wanted to do the cable car ride but I didn't know where it went from/to. Although I'd made no plans to go to Sentosa Island, when I found out that's where the cable car stops, I thought I may as well explore the island a bit.The cable car is definitely worth doing. It's a nice little trip and you get to see some good sights. It's obviously a bonus if you're on there around sunset time.There's a number of different ticket options which you can combine with attractions at Sentosa to make the package price a bit cheaper. There's also a cable car on Sentosa Island, so you can even buy a ticket where you can have unlimited rides on both cable cars. I opted for just the Mount Faber cable car return ticket which was $29 / ¬£16.Be sure to walk around Mount Faber before or after you get the cable car. It's a nice little walk with good photo opportunities.

Rather than purchase a specific ticket for this ride we purchased the 'Singapore Pass' that allowed us one 'free' complete circuit each. We rode all sections from the Island back to the main land.Every cable car offers different views of Singapore and it's many attractions. The ride provides a great view of the zip line, beach areas, Adventure Cove Water Park and Universal Studio.

The dining is around 1.5 hours, as you eat the sky get darker and more romantic along the way.

Singapore Cable Car,devonc918,A Great Experience with Family,40,29-May-17,"It was a last minute unplanned trip on a Sunday afternoon, my family and I decided to visit Sentosa island via the Singapore Cable Car after having our lunch at VivoCity mall. We boarded the cable car from Harbour Front tower 2, just 5 mins walk from VivoCity mall.Tickets were fairly priced, $33 per adult for a return trip on the Faber and Sentosa line. Faber line is the link from Mount Faber up till Sentosa island, then we alighted and walked about 3 mins to Imbiah Lookout station to hop on the Sentosa line which we took to Siloso beach, got off for a bit of sightseeing then boarded again to Merlion station to view the famous giant Merlion statue. The price tag per ticket wasn't too bad if you have plans to visit the whole island and stop over at Mount Faber for some nice views.The cable car itself was quite solid and it didn't shake mid air. Though it can get super hot and humid due to the hot weather and there were no fans or air cond available in the cable car except cooling fresh air from outside which we could hardly feel. So be prepared to sweat, and definitely wear beach or short clothing.Overall, we enjoyed the ride and this is definitely a must go to ride at least once, if you visit Singapore or Sentosa island.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r488637472-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

The cables are quite thick, The access on and off are very easy. It is a great introduction to Sentosa Island and its venues. I recommend a round trip ticket.

There was a little stand with a number on it but we didn't have phone access. There is apparently free wifi, but none of us could log on. The staff wouldn't call us a taxi but said we could go back to Vivo City (no extra charge) and get a cab from there.

Singapore Cable Car,Upanishads,High above held by a string you see the world around,40,30-Mar-17,"The cable experience is awesome. It starts from Harbor Front 15th floor. You shall be surprised to note that the cable car is boarded from the 15th floor (exact floor may be different) of a building. One takes an escalator to board the cable car.The capsule of the cable car can easily house 4-6 people; but the operators give all privacy to visitors by housing them to independent capsule on basis of their own company. Maybe that during huge visitor traffic they alter their practice.The cable moves above the sea line that differentiates the Singapore from Sentosa island. The cable starts rising high while crossing the water beneath. You shall sight yachts, steamers in the waters below. One shall sight the approaching Sentosa island and the Singapore left behind. The Sentosa island is housed with several attractions and resorts. From that height one is able to see the top surface of most of the attractions. The journey is small but interesting.Now, I must make the most important fact. While returning back by the same cable car do not disembark at the Harbor front point wherefrom you had embarked the cable. Keep sitting and inform the staff their that we want to see Mount Faber point. No extra amount is charged for this additional trip. They shall allow you to continue beyond and within minutes your journey explores an extension towards Mount Faber. It is a high spot encircled with many trees. It has a small shop and an open restaurant. You can spend some time over there and then return back by embarking the cable once again.The journey shall conclude at the same place where you had started from.

Singapore Cable Car,Thomas J,"Really nice view, ok cable car, sad stations and distressed ticket sales - a mix!",30,28-Dec-19,"A rather spectacular way to get to Singapore's big entertainment island Sentosa is to take the long cable car from the 'mainland'. The ride itself is beautiful with great views of the island and the entrance to the city. Exciting for the youngest and relaxing for the adults. The stations at each end are quite anonymous and breathe a little 'tourist trap', but fulfill their function. However, getting a ticket can be a real gamble!I had pre-booked a ticket from home before going to Singapore. Once in front, I went subway to a station near the cable car, then received guidance from various signs about where the ticket office was located (in a building just below the station itself). I knew earlier from the email I had received that my e-ticket had to be changed on the spot to a real ticket. Ok, nothing strange about it. Upon arriving at the ticket office, I was informed that it was not possible to change the ticket to a real one (!) But that I had to visit the nearby shopping center on floor three. The information turned out to be wrong - no ticket counter was on floor three, but they directed me (via the roof!) To the building next door where there was finally a small ticket door where they could change the ticket to a real ... Walk back all the way to the cable car's departure hall - where I was told that the ticket was not valid but in turn had to be changed precisely on the cable car's own ticket box. Elevator down, stand in line and well ahead: a new ticket! Back up to the cable car - and finally - off! It took me 90 minutes to solve a problem that could have been rectified with the right information from the beginning. I experienced this a couple more times on my travel, so if you buy a ticket from home in advance, check properly if the ticket is valid on the spot and - if not - where you exchange it on the spot. I had plenty of time and the weather was still bad, so it didn't matter to me personally this time other than to marvel at the inferior information and choice of solutions in place. Unfortunately, my experience lowers the rating by one star.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/27/ea/a4/thomas-j.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r734950356-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

The fee you pay at the beginning includes all this. The price on this website is out dated. It's even more- it was $105 Singaporean dollars for 3 of us.

Got the round trip ticket that covered a trip to each station and cost $32. Lots of ticket options with some including theme park tickets. Queue was small and never had to wait long to get on a gondola but as the day wears on it got busier so look to start early. Mine had air con and you could take pictures out of a small window of the various views. You are in an industrial harbour area so the sites are not that special but good nonetheless.

Singapore Cable Car,Kevin S,The views aren't worth the hype,30,18-Aug-18,"There are two lines to do, the faber line to take you from the harbour front and back the other Sentosa line a little sightseeing across the island.The price seems steep if you just want to get to the island and the shuttle is probably better.Whilst high up the views are underwhelming, so much building work is being done along with passing next to a major import shipping hub just allows you to see endless rows of shipping containers and some men pouring concrete.There is nothing in the cars or before to tell you what you are looking towards and indeed one end of the line seems to have nothing to get off and see.For me a waste of time and money",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/8a/avatar011.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r607536469-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,Desi_Boi,Singapore Stopover holiday Package,30,20-Apr-18,"So this was a solo trip that I was taking to Thailand and had booked myself on Singapore Airlines, the good things is that one can opt for something called as Singapore Stopover Holiday - which for travellers from India costs about USD78, and you get accommodation, and lots of entry passes at Singapore including the cable care ride. Best is if one wants to save time get to the Maritime Square Tower 2, to get on to the cable car & you can ride this to get into Sentosa. Now the thing is read clearly for signs which says queue for redemption. And these are not so usually easy to find on many of these pass inclusions that SSH has. And its just a cable car, if you have a child in you, maybe you could ride it, get some views of passing over some of the bay areas, and over a bit of Sentosa, otherwise give this a skip. You could also think of this as a ride to Sentosa as it would other wise cost you time and money too. Nothing really great about it though. While coming back you can either come back to the same place, look if your pass says round way, if it does (which is the case with SSH pass holders) then you can come back to the same location you started the ride and take a taxi. I rather took a cab from Sentosa, as it cost me the same to get back to my hotel from Sentosa directly, just saved on some time.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r574467265-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,richierichtraveller,Its good but little overrated and expensive,30,20-Feb-18,Singapore cable car to enter and exit Sentosa is one of the ways to commute to Sentosa. I personally felt its quite pricey and not worth. rather during the same month i visited Langkawi and i have never ever had a chance to experience one of the longest and most amazing cable cars ever that i had in Langkawi. So i could easily compare that Singapore cable car isn't worth the money and the short duration.

Singapore Cable Car,naabiha19,The whole experience was a bit meh :/,30,19-Feb-18,"Guys I apologise in advance, my review might sound a bit negative for some of you given the amazing trip adviser rating for this attraction on this site. I am trying to remain unbiased during writing this review but I do need to highlight how miserable my day was probably due to some bad decisions I made along the way. So first and foremost if this is the first time you are getting on a cable car then yeah you will definitely like it. But bear in mind the ride is short... like really really short it kindda finishes before it starts. They will try to make you share the cable car with others and can fit upto 8 people in one cable car! Tried to do fit 6 passengers and a buggy with us during one of our journey. It was the most uncomfortable 3/4 mins ride in the 30 degrees heat. There is no aircon so yeah be prepared to be steamed in the heat. Although i must mention there were some weak air ventilation. If you are the second group on-boarding the cars you are most certainly going to be sitting facing the opposite direction of travel and going to miss the view. If thats ok with you considering the bucks you will be paying then yeah these are no big deal. Now the big mistake I made that ruined my day...i bought cable car return tickets from my hotel concierge, trying to be clever and avoid long queues but didn't realise this was actually voucher and not tickets. So when I went to the cable car station they sent us to the monorail office to collect tickets. This was about 20 mins walk through two shopping malls, then another 10 mins queue to redeem the tickets from the desk then 15 mins walk back to the harbourfront station. I would recommend you buy the tickets directly from the station and avoid all the extra hassle if you can. Now somehow while getting back to the station I lost my tickets, must have dropped somewhere, this never happened to me before. I went to the ticket desk to ask if they can help me in this situation, they basically told me to bugger off! Spoke to the tour company who issued the vouchers they weren't helpful either. I was really surprised a big company like sentosa doesn't have any system in place to assist genuine customers in this kind of situation. I had all my other papers with me showing i paid etc. How difficult was it for them to track and ticket they issued against the vouchers and block it and reissue new ones. No idea! They sympathised and was polite but basically didn't help me at all. Lesson for me get digital tickets where I can! Given I was there for few days I repurchased the tickets and went to sentosa. But didn't enjoy the whole experience Probably because I was let down a bit by this whole dramatic incident and ended up spending ‚Ç¨132 for what a 15/20 mins cable car ride for two. A return trip will cost you $33 singapore dollars.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0e/55/da/c5/nabiha-n.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r561269951-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,robyne449,Almost fine dining,30,2-Dec-17,We enjoyed our dining experience on the cable car however I will make a few comments it is not a 4 course dinner as 1st course is a shared bowl of nuts with champagne before hopping on and I don't call that a course. I chose the fish it was delicious all 3 mouth fulls my dinner was such a small serving while my husband chose the steak which was also delicious and a very generous serving desert also delicious. When I think of a fine dining experience I think white table cloth maybe a flower on the table not a plastic tray.

Singapore Cable Car,mauidivers,Save your money,30,13-Sep-17,The cable car departs from Mount Faber which doesn't have good transit links or taxi's that frequent. It costs $29 to ride round trip as they don't offer one way fares. For $31 you can ride the cable car to the island then once on the island you can ride the other one. We randomly grabbed a map that offered a $3 discount on the dual cable car so both that. When we asked if there were taxi's that could pick us up from Mount Faber they told us to get off at Vivo city mall. There weren't many people there that day so we had the cable car to ourselves. It's a nice ride with a great view. Once on the island we decided to go exploring before getting on the other cable car. We went to both beaches and when we tried to find where to pick up the other cable car as we were tired it was nowhere close to where we were. We finally just jumped on the free tram that went from the island to Vivo city.

The original price of the ticket is kinda expensive but we got a contact who sells with discount price. So, we bought tickets for Harbourfront Station to Mount Faber (Round) and Harbourfront to Sentosa Station (Round). First, you need to go to Habourfront Tower which you can ride MRT (Circle and Purple LIne). Then, head to Mount Faber First and if you want to spend sometimes there, get out off the cable car and enjoy the picturesque view. There was a souvenir shop, too. After that, go back to cable car station and take a ride to Sentosa Station via Harbourfront Station. For us, we did not get out of the cable car and took ride to Sentosa. But, one of the family who got out of the car need to get in again with our cable car to sentosa station. Whatever, we enjoyed the ride with them, too. We are amazed by the color of the sea which is very clean and green. Moreover, you can see some private boats along the shore. For the line of Harbourfront to Mount Faber, you can enjoy the green views which is the mountain sides.

Nonetheless, we're thankful that there was a monorail station across the cable car station.Wouldn't have bought tickets if we didn't have the 40% off as we feel that the tickets are a little overpriced before the discount.

Singapore Cable Car,Jenanime,Nice views but quite overpriced for a short journey! :),30,19-Jun-16,"It's worth travelling once on the Singapore Cable Car to Sentosa for the lovely views. However, I do find the ticket prices rather overpriced for a relatively short journey from Harbourfront station to Sentosa that only takes a few minutes. It costs 33S$ for a return journey or 43S$ for unlimited rides all day. If you get the unlimited ticket, I recommend riding up to Mount Faber as well for a stunning view of Harbourfront and Sentosa. Be careful during the weekends as the queues for the cable car can get super long. It's probably better to travel to Sentosa first in the morning, then head to Mount Faber in the afternoon to avoid the queues.I would also recommend travelling on the cable car only when it is a clear day as the rain would obstruct a great deal of your view. If it is raining during your travels, then the Sentosa Express is another speedy option priced at only 4S$ for a return journey.The unlimited ticket option allows you to redeem a free souvenir magnet from the Singapore Cable Car gift shop, but make sure when you hand over your ticket stub to the staff that you get it back after redeeming your complimentary gift. The gift shop staff took away my ticket stub and I didn't think much of it at the time since I had the blue wristband on me that they give you as well at the Harbourfront ticket office. However, later on when I wanted to get on the cable car at Siloso station, the person checking the tickets said you need to show the ticket stub in addition to the blue wristband. I had to go all the way back to the gift shop and ask for the ticket stub that the staff member had forgotten to give back to me. Do keep your ticket stub with you at all times! :)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0b/6e/d4/17/jenanime4eva.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r383702740-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,George B,A Very Expensive Trip,30,27-Jan-16,The Singapore Cable car has been upgraded since we last visited.The cable car runs form Sentosa island to Harbourfront terminal and then on to Mt. Faber.The cable car is very expensive to ride - there are no one way fares and the fare for a return trip is $SG26 each - no discount.As a result most people now take the monorail from the new Harbourfront terminal (some 150m away) - the cost is $SG 4 each way. The new harbourfront terminal is at the entrance to Harbourfront metro station.At the Mt Faber terminal ther is no public transport form the top to the bottom - no bus service etc - so you either walk down the hill or catch the cable car back to Harbourfront. At Mt. Faber there is only an expensive restaurant - even the lookout is now closed and can not be accessed.As a result the most popular route to access Sentosa Island is now the monorail.However the view across the bay to Singapore is spectacular to say the least - but comes at a price,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/14/fe/5b/24/george-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r342943499-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

It is possible to leave the car at Mount Imbiah station to check the views from the observation area.We then took the cable car back to the mainland and stayed on it until reaching Mount Haber, where there is a restaurant, shop and bar / bistro.

Another 10 minutes and no luck. However, there were many personal cars and busy taxis driving by. Finally another attendant recommended we take the cable car towards Harbourfront. Then from there, get a taxi. It would've been nice if we got this heads up earlier.So the attendant explains to the other attendants our situation (there were 4 other families waiting with us). We finally arrive at Harbourfront. We however needed to walk a little bit to make it to the taxis. Once we made it to the taxis, we needed to wait over an hour. There was a line queued, so we lined up as well.Once again, I'd give the cable cars a 5 digit, but the fact that they never gave us a warning really bothered me.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ec/3d/default-avatar-2020-1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r294405562-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,elementary1969,Once is enough,30,20-May-15,"The cable car in Singapore runs from Sentosa to Mount Faber. It provides nice views of Sentosa and HarbourFront and the wider port area. It could not be described as exciting though. I thought it was expensive for such a short trip but worth doing once, but not something which I would pay to do again.

Singapore Cable Car,Saumya M,not that great,30,27-Apr-15,"The motivation behind the link auto ride is with the goal that you can see the perspectives of Singapore and Sentosa Island. Be that as it may, its really pricey about $25 for a grown-up ticket. It goes really speedy and actually, I didn't think it was justified regardless of the cost however, by and by.

Singapore Cable Car,Robert3339,Worth the trip,30,26-Apr-15,The actual chair lift is quite fun but it is the short walk up to the look-out that make the trip worth while.I do think this is over-priced however.Avoid the tourist trap as you get off the cable car - the food is also no good and over-priced.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r267994447-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html
Singapore Cable Car,721saurabhs,"Special if you are a first timer on cable car, otherwise just an verage experience",30,25-Apr-15,"First things first:There are two stations in Singapore from where you can get onto this cable car, one at Faber Peak and another at Harbor Front station (Vivo city mall). I took it from Harbor Front station.I took it on a weekday and there was no queue for tickets. You can checkout combo tickets if you are visiting other attractions at Sentosa. Ticket is expensive IMHO. You will get a return ticket only. I am not sure if they have one side ride tickets.Now, if this is a your first cable car ride, you sure gonna enjoy this. Though the ride is quite short, but the view of the ocean below will surely lure you into photography. You also see an overview of whole Sentosa island, and its various attractions.If you have been to cable cars before, then there is nothing special for you here. In my opinion, you can very well skip it.What is the fuss about superheroes, I did not understand. They provided few masks and badges with tickets, you need to download some app on your mobile, I did not know what that is all about and it did not attract me do go into all that downloading etc.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/c3/dc/51/saurabhsaxenablr.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r267868807-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Whilst we enjoyed ourselves for the short rides to Sentosa and Mount Faber it really isn't worth a trip just on itself.It would be good to combine with a visit to Sentosa.Also at Mount Faber they are missing a trick, they should have a viewing platform of the city with picture opportunities for tourists who visit.

Singapore Cable Car,RamblingTales,Don't Rock The Car,30,24-Nov-14,"We used the cable car as access to Sentosa Island, and for that it is a good option, but as a stand alone attraction, I am not too sure. At S$29.00 per adult, it's not exactly cheap for what amounts to about a 15 minute ride. We did get a 10% discount for mentioning that we flew with Jetstar though. Just show your boarding pass. Boarding as we did at Harbour Front, we first travelled up to Mount Faber, where we had only enough time to take in the views from the lookout (go through the gift shop), before re-embarking on our trip across to Sentosa Island. At the Sentosa Island juncture, you can opt to look through the cable car museum which is included in your ticket price. We didn't this time, but did several years ago. It was a worthy attraction, but not a must see. The round trip later saw us delivered safely but otherwise unenthused back at Harbour Front.

Singapore Cable Car,AsiaMorgan,Beautiful - but brief and expensive,30,29-Jun-14,"I guess if you're in Singapore and oblivious to all the money you're spending on vacation, add this one to the list. it's not that this cable car ride is bad - it's not, it's very good, as is everything somehow connected to Sentosa. The problem is that it's very expensive - about US$25 a head, and it only lasts about ten to 15 minutes. If you've been on cable car rides in other Asia locations, like Hong Kong, you'll get a better bang for buck, and see much, more more. I would not say this is a must see; that said, I imagine kids will find it fascinating, and if you've got money to burn, burn it on this, too.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/a6/68/4d/asiamorgan.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r212578685-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html
Singapore Cable Car,backpack00,Just okay,30,18-Jun-14,There is nothing special in this ride though they are claiming that they are the first cable car provider with Justice League design in their cable cars. From Harbor we went to Sentosa and the cable car that brought us to Sentosa has no any mark of Justice League.

Singapore Cable Car,ishamelYoussef,An old attraction of Singapore!,30,10-Jun-14,"Nothing really special about the cable car ride to and fro Sentosa island, It is just another option to reach Sentosa Island. You can enjoy the view and get to ride as much as you like if you buy travel package at Sentosa Island, which in my case brought me to Faber Mountain Cable car station which I found to be a small hilly nature wonder worth to explore if you love to be surround by trees and bushes.It's an old attraction that did not give me a thrills as other cable car in this part of the world.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/04/97/46/7d/ishamelyoussef.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r209671149-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html
Singapore Cable Car,HimalayaExplorer,Newer car lacks bottom glass,30,2-Jun-14,"I took this ride first in 2003. The cars at that time were small (could sit 4 persons) but they had a glass bottom. I think that was their USP. This time in May-2014 when I took the ride again, the car was specious (6-8 persons can sit) BUT the bottom glass was missing! It takes the fun out of the ride, to be frank! Anyways, the view below is very good.My suggestion is that while going to Sentosa from main land, get-in at Tower 2 on HarbourFront. Then while returning from Sentosa go all the way till Faber Peak. Enjoy the walk there and then again get-in and finally alight at Tower 2.Also, if you are planning two trips to Sentosa - one for Universal Studios and other for the other attractions on Sentosa like the Luge, Dolphin Lagoon etc. then have the Cable Car ride once and have the Sentosa Express on second day. Now, the EZLink card is accepted for Sentosa Express as well.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/07/f4/ee/b4/himalayaexplorer.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r208448796-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,LeeClaxton .,Ask yourself if it is really necessary,30,21-Apr-14,"The Singapore Cable Car first opened in 1974 and acts as a form of aerial transportation between Sentosa and Mount Faber across the Keppel Harbour. It is one of the main tourist attractions on Sentosa, with over 80 pods carrying up to 8 passengers each.I usually get a taxi or the cheap and efficient MRT when I want to go to Sentosa (there are fantastic dining outlets at Sentosa) although for a change I thought why don't I make the journey on the famous cable car. I do have a fear of heights, but I was prepared to risk my life on this occasion! It is not as steep as the epic Langkawi Cable Car in Malaysia, nor the ropeway at Table Mountain in Cape Town, but it is still very high above the harbour giving amazing panoramic views of the area. From the Jewel Box at Mount Faber (which has a great caf√©, by the way), I headed down to Sentosa: Singapore's playground!I can remember paying S$29 for my adult one way ticket. I cannot remember how much the return fare was, but I only wanted to do one journey anyway (I don't think my vertigo could have taken much more!). The queue for the cable car once you have purchased your ticket is always very busy, and I stood there for a long time waiting for a pod to become available. It must have taken a good half hour from when I bought my ticket to when I entered the actual pod and got moving. Anyhow, there were amazing views as we immediately pulled out of the station. The Singapore Cable Car is not really a long ride 'ì it only lasts around 10 minutes in the air 'ì but as with all things in Singapore there was a great ambience to the whole thing and you could see that families and young children were enjoying the spectacular setting. I had an Indian family in my pod with me, which made taking videos quite difficult but I made sure I had a lot of photos of my experience!At the beginning and end of your journey there are opportunities to buy various merchandise and souvenirs, but to be honest it all looked a bit tacky to me (stuff like 'I Love SG' T-shirts), so I just walked through the gift shops and out into what was Imbiah Lookout on Sentosa, quite near the Tiger Sky Tower. It would be interesting to compare the views from the Cable Car and the Sky Tower, and maybe I will get a chance to do so soon!But if you are heading for the Singapore Cable Car, bear in mind the hefty price, and ask yourself if it would be more economical to take a taxi to Sentosa instead (or even cheaper, the MRT). The views are amazing from the Cable Car ride, but you can get aerial views of Singapore for less $$$ elsewhere.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0d/4d/a7/a1/backpackerlee.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r201978143-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,dr_natasha76,Gallery for Rich,30,21-Mar-14,"Singapore is really a glamorous city, highly expensive and excellently planned. it was a business tour for 4 days. I had to be on wheels but tried best to gallop as much as I could with eyes. every place of attraction was expensive. I tried the cable car for the first time in my life and I believe it was never a wastage. Marina bay, Sentosa Island are best for kids or fun lovers as there are so many amusements. I loved to visit the Sentosa fort where the memories from WWII was treasured so nicely. I hate to go to Mustafa it is nothing but a crowd but may the people who must buy something for family on return may visit and it is the only shopping place open 24hours. most of the Bangladeshis were around it, like Little Bangla.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/65/fe/7e/dr-natasha76.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r198073106-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

I understand that safety is critical, but having even a small opening in the Plexiglas cover that would allow for a clear, non-glass reflective, photo would have been wonderful.

Pretty short ride too. Forget the ""Adventure"" package. Its a lot more expensive but combines the cable car ride with several attractions on Sentosa. The Sea aquarium is a must see but others (Merlion) not so much. While the Segway and Luge rides are also good, the line ups are long and your high-end-can't-live-with- out ""Adventure"" ticket only provides one round for each while most other riders opt for a ticket to go three times.

What was not clear was that since Harbourfront is in the middle of the 2 destinations you can only get to one destination - hence we ended up at Mount Faber with the prospect of paying 40$+ just to get back to Harbourfront on the cable car!

We went as a big family group and used the 50% off scheme else cable car seemed bit expensive. The car itself moves really slow so can easily take snaps and enjoy the view of sentosa.

However, when we went to Mt. Faber, they refused us and insisted we first get our tickets from Sentosa. The same happened when we went to the Harbor view office of Mt.

When we were in Singapore the cable car to Sentosa had a temporary Angry Birds theme, so we had to take the ride. The view was great. He enjoyed it very much so I guess I would recommend the ride to all travelling with young children. The buses on Sentosa are free so you can get around the island easily. Personally I preferred Sentosa as it was 40 years ago!

Singapore Cable Car,Pearlie_76,Good deal - good experience for the family,30,12-Jun-12,"The ride itself was not that long compared to the Cable Car in HK but the scenery was very good especially when getting near Sentosa. Since i was with my family (4), we applied for the Jewel Card family membership for unlimited access for 1 year by paying S$99. Initially, they offered the Angry Birds family membership worth S$139 but I told the counter personnel that I will not opt for it. Otherwise, I would have paid for $29 per person and that will only be good for one trip. The deal I got should be good for a family of four who has also just settled in Singapore.From Harbourfront Tower, you can opt to go directly to Sentosa or go to Mount Faber.

Singapore Cable Car,sydneyadmiral,An OK way to spend a couple of hours (or less),30,29-Sep-11,"Taking a trip on the cable car was an attempt to see Singapore from different angles and maybe get some photographs of the islands and beyond. It was not a good day for this as the haze was pronounced and visibility was low but as I have a flight out tomorrow, it was the only chance.I got on the cable car at HarbourFront - easy to find and well signposted. I had originally wanted only to go to the hill station at Mount Faber but was told the ticket was valid for Sentosa too. I could have chosen a package of places to visit but these did not tempt me (inclusive costs seemed to range from about $S69 - 81 per adult). The cost of the full trip was $S26.00I had the cable car to myself and snapped away - however the heat was tremendous and most embarassingly I had rivers of sweat pouring off me by the time I reached Mount Faber after what seemed like only a few minutes. Fake cherry trees were placed around the edge and when I tried to find my way out of the cable car platform (apart from the viewing platform and gift shop) all the exits had chains across them. I didn't ask if I could descend to road level and have a look around as I was so hot and sticky. After a cold coke ($S3.00) I thought I would take the full trip to Sentosa as I had hardly had my money's worth. The next car (and the subsequent one) were better ventilated and I made it to Sentosa without melting, took a few pictures of the Merlion but failed to avail myself of the 11 attractions on offer as they held little interest. As a person of more mature years, I just wasn't enticed by them but no doubt, if it had been 25 years earlier, my children might have enjoyed Tiger Ride (shooting I forget how many feet up into the air and down again), the Butterfly Park or actually going into the Merlion who seems a bit like the cousin of the concrete Big Merino. And it certainly wasn't the proprietors' fault that the visibility was so poor.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/27/83/fd/sydneyadmiral.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r118735583-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Faber, exploring the jewel box and some of the centerpieces they had around the complex as well as the views which was quite pleasant. We then took the car from there all the way over to Sentosa.Ride was smooth and quick (the cars actually move quite fast in my opinion) and we took some time to explore the cable car museum (available when you get off in Sentosa) which was interesting (they have a car constructed entirely out of legos!).Once you've done it once, no need to do it again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-a/03/7a/8e/6c/gbabigurl84.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r117568321-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

To get full value for money, catch a taxi (e.g. from the rank outside Vivocity) up to the top of Mt Faber so you can catch the cable car the full way down. Don't expect fantastic photos - the cabin windows are scratched plastic. Better shots of Singapore (of the city) can be had from the Singapore Flyer with clear glass viewing.

Singapore Cable Car,CycleSean,Don't waste your money,20,25-Mar-18,"We were led to believe that the cable car was the best way to get to Universal Studios on Sentosa. It's definitely the most expensive and the lengthiest and if you like long queues and standing out in the heat, then definitely pay the exorbitant entrance fee.We booked online but you still have to stand in line at the ground floor of the station house to collect you actual paper ticket. Then more queueing at the top of the station house as you wait for the cable car to arrive. Granted, the views from the cable car are spectacular and our kids loved the ride, but it was very quick and we were soon on a Sentosa and walking down a long hill to the bus stop to wait 15-minutes for the Universal Studios bus, which is a misnomer as the bus serves ALL attractions so it was jammed packed. A 10 minute hard fought bus ride later we arrived at our destination.We discovered too late that the last cable car departs Sentosa at 6:30 pm (seriously?) so we had to find an alternative route off Sentosa which was when we discovered that a regular city bus runs from the mainland directly to Universal Studios and back. And there was no charge back to the mainland (you only pay for the service to Sentosa).So, in conclusion, don't waste your time or money taking the cable car - take the bus. It will only cost you a $1 or $2 and will take you far less time while being a whole lot more comfortable.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r568578993-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Staff were not helpful about how to catch the bus back with no one directing people to where they needed to go to get the bus. Only a sign at the cable car announced the service outage with staff watching people walk up to read the sign rather than helping direct and explain what was happening. We ended up getting an Uber off the island as we had no idea how long s bus was going to be.

However given the hot and humid weather of Singapore the ride wasn't exactly a fun experience as it does get stuffy and hot inside the car.They do have mini fans to help keep things cool but it doesn't really help much given the heat and weather of Singapore.The only good thing about the cable car is that it offers a bird eye view of Sentosa island and also it's attraction which is something for first time visitors.However I would suggest to take the train option to sentosa island as it may be a better and economical choice compared to the cable car.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/04/9c/53/08/bltc88.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r382109870-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

I was enticed to buy the family membership of $120. However on several occasions, I went up. There was no feedback on when the cable car service was closed for maintenance wasting my trip up to Mount Faber for the ride. Mimially, they should just sent some email to us to inform us about this so that we can be more playful and intentional in planning our trip or put it on the website. There was an occasion where I forgot to bring my own card. However, I brought my children's card. Hence, I asked for help as it was troublesome to go back home. They told me coldly to go home and that means 2 hours to come back to and fro. We gave up riding on that day. I asked to see the customer service manager and was told to take the lift. There were 3 lifts in the cable car towers and I just don't know which one to take to see the customer service manager. The customer service manager should be stationed downstairs to support the customer and not in some ivory tower.

Singapore Cable Car,George I,Not worth the time and money,20,6-Feb-13,"Out of all the attractions in Singapore, this shouldn't make the top 50 list. It's expensive, it has almost no views and takes you to Mount Faber which barely has anything to show and is packed with expensive restaurants. Comparing this to other cable cars in the region (like Hong Kong) or the views you get from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel platform, this cable car ride makes no sense.Unless you or your kids get any kicks from the Angry Birds theme, stay away from this ""attraction"".",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/c6/34/a0/phgeorge.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r151505415-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,BrittBon,Not bad but not great either,20,24-Dec-12,"I read in another review on Trip Advisor that the Cable Car offers better views and value than the Flyer but after trying both, my personal preference is the Flyer (if you're going to choose just one). The views from the Cable Car are beautiful, and the attraction is clean and well run. The down side for me was that the ride is very short and there isn't a map provided to help you understand what you're looking at. Plus, you get the same views from the top of the mountain, so you can save some money and just take a taxi or bus to the top.If you decide to check out this attraction and you're a local, the year pass offers the best value. For just $9 more than the cost of a single round-trip ride you get unlimited Cable Car rides, access to Sentosa and a 20% discount when you buy a ride pass for a friend/visitor.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/c6/0d/f7/brittbon.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r147984601-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html
Singapore Cable Car,George H,"Badly organised, badly managed and poor value",20,16-Dec-12,"The Singapore cable car has a great product - a scenic cable car from wooded Mount Faber through Harbour Front to Sentosa, but the management and pricing of the attraction is disappointing. The whole experience is set up to maximise revenue rather than any focus on the customer experience or customer satisfaction. For example:Why is there no automated ticketing? How hard is it to sell tickets from a machine instead of making people stand in line? Instead, you have to stand in a long queue to purchase ticket seemingly sold by under-motivated, slow staff, whose numbers seem disproportionate to their productivity. Three staff members today and only one till open. The staff exist only to try to sell confusing packages. The woman in front of me was told it would be cheaper for her to buy a ticket for her three year old who was technically free because then she would benefit from an even bigger discount than if she bought the tickets separately. The ticket prices and ticket selling are a joke process designed to confuse customers and distract them from the high prices being charged.Why can't they sell one way tickets? We were three adults and three children who wanted to take the cable car one way from Mount Faber to Harbour Front. We had completed a hike and needed to get down from the hill. But you can't buy one way tickets, or you can, but the return ticket is the same price. Instead we paid $99 for various packages and promotions which featured Angry Birds drinks and masks, and probably the full trip to Sentosa and back. I felt completely ripped off and angry at having waited ten minutes to be gouged. The Singapore residents in the queue in front felt the same as they spent a good ten minutes like us trying to work out what package they were being sold and arguing at the nonsensical muddle that is the sales process.You're running a cable car which goes from A to B to C. Not difficult to organise one way tickets and ride only fares surely? But not if your objective is to rip off the punters.Summary: I enjoyed the ride in the cable car, I didn't enjoy being taken for a ride by the management.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/c0/8c/c5/thehorseys.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r147494566-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

I have been on other cable cars elsewhere in the world and this would be the worst value for money anywhere. Others obviously agreed it was overpriced judging by the people that left the ticket office without buying tickets once they realised how much it would cost.

Singapore Cable Car,yunempire,Bad experience in customer service at Mount Faber Cable Car station,10,19-Dec-20,"I have a terrible and unpleasant experience with the bad customer service provided by the One Faber Group staffs. I have utilised the rediscover Singapore vouchers with Klook for my cable car ride. Klook has sent me 5 QR codes for 5 tickets bought. Upon entry to board the cable car, the staff claimed that there was issues with 2 of my QR code tickets. She then advised me to go to the ticketing counter to redeem the 2 QR code tickets which have issues. I then proceed to the ticketing counter as per her advice. However, the staffs at ticketing counter gave me a different advice. They requested that I have to pay for the two tickets which have issues. After which, I have to write in to Klook to request for a refund for the 2 tickets paid. I then asked the ticketing staffs for a better alternative to resolve my ticketing issues. I explained to them that it is unfair for consumers to pay for the tickets out of their own pockets and has to chase the refund from Klook due to the glitch by Klook. I tried patiently to reason with them. The staff then tried to call Klook for half an hour but in avail. I had to wait for them to resolve the issue. I wanted to speak to the manager but could only get him 15mins later. In the end, he did not provide a satisfactory solution to my problem and keep emphasing that the problem lies with Klook and not with One Faber Group. This is certainly a very unpleasant and bad customer service provided by One Faber Group. I feel that I was being penalised for some glitches in the travel app. Especially in consumers' views, they did not provide an amicable solution to the issues which were not caused by consumers. I will certainly not recommend any family and friends to take cable car rides because of the customer service provided was utterly disappointing, unsatisfactory and unprofessional.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r779574610-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

As we were not aware we have started Sentosa line and completed which very small line and then we wanted to go for Mount faber line. The staff informed us that it was on maintenance. I feel like cheated because they should have put notice board outside the sentosa line that another line is in maintenance so we will not utilize the ticket as you can only use the ticket for both the line on same day so we approach staff ask them to if they can validate so we can come tomorrow or next weekend but that was the worst experience.

Don't expect any service from the staff who are not willing to go an extra mile for anything else other than serving the designated food, which of course I didn't touch my portion of at all that night.

Singapore Cable Car,Gerard G,Overpriced and boring,10,13-Feb-17,"We got on the cable car at Harbour front to Sentosa Island. The cable car is so far away from the city that it wasn't even worth taking a photograph. the main view is of container ships, docks and cranes. It cost around $50 dollars for the Faber Line. When you get to Sentosa there is another cable car that crosses the island for about $13 dollars which I'm sure would be far more interesting and a third of the price. On the return we stayed on the cable car to mount Faber hoping that we might get a decent view but that was worse. Trees obscured all the possible views.I would advise you to get the free shuttle bus or the cheap monorail (about $4 I think) across the bridge to Sentosa and use the cable car on the island itself.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/c2/9c/e4/griffged16.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r458969449-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,Allan J,Do not waste your time,10,27-Jun-16,"This is a very expensive form of travel and there are better ways to see Sentosa Island like walking the amazing boardwalk from VivoCity to the Island (which is free, undercover, has traveletors for those that are lazy and keeps you dry from the rain). The cable car is very pricy, so if you are looking for an experience of a cable car than this is good, but does not need to be on the list of things to do in Sentosa.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/c6/39/08/allan-j.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r386265024-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html

Singapore Cable Car,sirtripsmania,Extremely bad customer service,10,27-Apr-16,"We bought 3 tix for the cable car, starting at merlion station on Sentosa as we were staying at resorts world. My daughters wanted to ride the Mount Faber line, so we had to purchase the Sky Pass tickets to get us onto the Mt Faber line from the merlion station.Whilst riding the Mr Faber line, the line kept stopping and starting, making my children and wife very scared. We were then told to get off at Harbour front station.I asked for a refund, and it took 20 mins before I got an answer, and to my surprise, they told me they will only give me a partial refund as I had already ridden on the cable car. WHAT KIND OF RESPONSE IS THAT!?Very disappointed Singapore Cable Car! You should be ashamed of your customer service!WARNING everyone, if you experience any issues with the ride, don't expect a good outcome if you ask for a refund!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/09/f5/88/31/sirtripsmania.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r367996994-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html
Singapore Cable Car,TemasekBoy,Overpriced for ride that is too short.,10,27-Mar-16,"Ride is too short for the ridiculous overprice. Especially if you are bringing other people along. Don't bother.Save that money for other things. There are other ways to get to sentosa and there are other free views you can get.Nearby to Mount Faber, 10 minutes walk there is Henderson wave.

Not too much to ask. Burger buns were stale - tasted of mould. Asked for new burger buns. Still tasted of mould. By which time the burger and fries were cold so I asked for a hot burger and fries. So the second burger tasting of mould, over my original burger which was tepid with my original fries which were cold were delivered!!!! Time out!!!

Singapore Cable Car,KraZkatlady,What a rip off!,10,15-Apr-13,"Looked everywhere on their website to find out how much the short ride from Harbourfront to Mount Faber was and all they had was the entire ride to Sentosa. Got to Harbourfront and was put off by the long queue. So walked up to Mount Faber to have lunch. On the way back, we decided to take the cable car back to Harbourfront. Asked at the ticket booth and was told one way or return same price $26. Get off at Harbourfront or Sentosa also same price $26. Why don't they be more upfront with such information and state this fact on their website? Unfortunately, this is the typical unyielding, inflexible system that is rife in this country. It seems that what the consumers want matters absolute squat to these people. Nice way to run a tourist attraction!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/78/ee/a1/krazkatlady.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r157797424-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html
Singapore Cable Car,natalya r,Avoid like the plague!!,10,28-Mar-13,"The worst spent ¬£29 in our entire lives... yes that is how much it cost to transport two people across to Sentosa island in what was a 10 minute journey!! What's more is we only wanted to get a single but they only sell a return ticket! It's a nice view yes, but if we knew the price before hand we would never have considered it! The view is not worth that at all! Whats more is you can only get to the cable car by taxi... so that cost us another ¬£10 on top! all in all a very expensive morning before we had even arrived at the island. Would HIGHLY recommend taking the metro which is ¬£1.50 each or walk for only 50p (takes about 30 mins)... if only we had known this beforehand.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/f6/59/1d/tamara-l.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r155815298-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html
Singapore Cable Car,George A,Jewel Box cable car ride,10,23-Jul-12,"We were at Mt.Faber on 19th July 2012 .. To begin with, there was no parking faciity whatseoever.....only valet parking (which I got to know about too late!). There were limited directions on where to purchase the cable car tickets....the valets (who were very friendly) asked us to go upstairs - the cablecar attendants guided us to shop front on Level 2 - who in turn asked to go back downstairs just behind the valets parking counter !The guy at the ticket counter was a disinterested bloke...possibly bored that there were hardly any visitors....atleast when we took the ride. We were forced to buy return journey (via cable car) tickets at $$29/pax. They do NOT sell one-way cable car tickets! Did I tell you that they also give you free drink (sugar water) and some angry bird masks!While the cable car ride by itself is good, the management should consider a $15/pax - one way option.Go for the ride only if you have small kids....

Singapore Cable Car,Tyler33022,RIPOFF!!!!!!!,10,23-Nov-11,"My brother (8) and I (12) went on the Cable Cars today from Sentosa Island to the mainland and were extremely bored. There really wasn't anything to see except for trees and a construction site. The ride was too short and a complete ripoff. It cost S $52, whereas a cab cost only S $10. My dad says that it was the same price as our lunch. On our way back, we had to get off in some building on the Harbor front and STILL had to take a cab back. My advice?

No date given. i can only rate this as terrible as I could not go on it and the information about it being closed and when it was re opening again was not very good when I got to the ticket desk.I would recommend this on the basis that seeing the span between start and end point, the views and the ride would be great.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/b2/99/26/columbuscompass.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d315470-r65300873-Singapore_Cable_Car-Singapore.html
