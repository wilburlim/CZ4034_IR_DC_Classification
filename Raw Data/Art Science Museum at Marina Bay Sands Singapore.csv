ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,KYHENG,Amazing architecture / interesting exhibition,50,13-Mar-21,"It is a unique architectural form stands out as an icon within the equally striking Marina Bay Sands which is one of the two integrated resorts in Singapore. While the other focuses on fun, MBS focus on exhibitions and conventions.The exterior form while viewed from far is liken the splashing of water and has relevance to the ship like form of the hotel behind. When you draw near, you will noticed that the building is supported mainly by concrete (I think) stilts, given a sense of impossible support. To maintain this openness feel, the entrance to the museum is encased in glass and it's so well done that i have never noticed it the last 5 or so years I have been passing in front of it, unless I have a reason to look for it today.Beyond the entrance lies a cafeteria which is well positioned to serve as a waiting area for visitors to the museum. The exhibition halls are located above and below this level and is reached by lifts and stairs (I think).At the basement, the middle opens into a courtyard space looking up into sky. This is a great way of bringing nature and natural light into an otherwise dark basement.Future World - an exhibition centers around interactive images and light shows is happening now. The show is interesting as one could interact with the wall projection by touching it. Some of the exhibits even allow you to draw relevant images and upload it into the projection using a scanner.The last exhibit is a light show which makes use of floor and wall mirrors to give the impression of endless rows of light.An exhibition not to be missed. In my opinion.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1c/c4/8b/75/kyheng.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r784466858-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,scubamom1234,More impressed than expected!,50,15-Sep-19,"The Art Museum is at the bay front area near the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. You can receive a discount for the tickets if you show your Marina Sands Club card. You must enter the elevator and go down to the basement to purchase tickets. Although there were 3 exhibits, we chose the Future World exhibit. I was more impressed than a child. The exhibits are soothing, and interactive. Our favorite part involved coloring on pre-printed sea animal pictures, then you place in the scanner and instantly they come to life on the wall. It's a lot of fun to see the turtle swimming, the jellyfish moving, sailfish swishing around...etc. It's new technology that I had not experienced. The same repeats in another room but with a city scene. Visitors can color cars, trucks, planes, and space ships.A separate wall has Oriental characters that once touched turn magically into animated animals on the wall.There are plenty of other activities for kids, all hands on interactive.On the weekends, when it's more crowded, there may controlled entrance times, so ask at the ticket counter.Overall, impressive and surprised by this fun museum.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r709880844-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html
ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,hwnew,Art science 08.19,50,7-Sep-19,"We visited the Art Science museum for three exhibitions; Floatopia, Future meets Science, Alice in Wonderland.Alice in Wonderland, the experience was very well explained on entry and we had different maps to look around and explore. There was a lot about the background on Lewis Carroll and how Alice had came to life over the years in different countries. There were good opportunities for photos and lots on for young and old alike.Future meets Science - the exhibition gets the public involved with digital integration. However it is fairly crazy in parts with people standing and not moving or moving slowly on walls. Everyone eventually gets a turn at the main areas. The lights are very pretty and can leave you in awe.Floatopia - this has been put on the top floor and it's a blimp full of joy with giant inflations taking up space and you'd want to run up and cuddle it but you will be asked to step back from the artwork to a marked point for photos.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/fe/1a/21/helen-w.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r707415511-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,SurfingWild,Wonderful place for the family,50,8-Jun-19,"One of the best places to visit in Singapore, especially if you are with young kids, but also for adults with a sense of fun too.We actually bought our tickets through Klook but realized our mistake after we saw a sign saying that on that particular day children could enter free of charge. But we did take advantage of this by buying adult tickets at the ticket office for Wonderland and the children got in free.We started with Future World which my kids went craxy about. My wife and I also had terrific fun. We coloured in pictures of cars, rocket ships, buses and trucks and then scanned them into a machine and the next moment our drawings were floating across a huge screen on roads. We must have spent about half an hour playing around here.There are several activities like this, another with butterflies where you can touch them on the screen and they fall down. And another where you colour in things and they are displayed moving across the screen. I have to say this again, that my young children had an absolutely brilliant time. I believe there were about six or seven activities here and they were all fun.The second attraction here was Wonderland with an Alice in Wonderland theme. This could involve adults more than the previous attraction and was enormous fun. It included exploring different areas and looking for clues and doing several other activities. The one we enjoyed the most was having a photo taken of our faces and then seeing ourselves as a playing card with arms and legs and our silly faces bouncing around across a large screen.So as a place to bring young children I would say definitely visit the ArtScience Museum. For young couples or couples with a good sense of fun then you will also have fun here too.

You just have to visit!We had two people with us who were initially very vocal about the fact they didn't like 'úmuseums'ù and were sceptical of what this would be about. They loved it!The 'Future World' exhibits were all about people interacting with art and science. For example, you could colour in or draw a house, plane, car on a regular piece of paper and then quickly scan it and watch it be added to a giant, animated virtual city, alongside everyone else's creations.There was a dark room with a virtual waterfall where the presence of people in the room disrupted the flow of water just like it would in nature.Basically, I highly recommend it and you should check it out for yourself! Allow about 90-120mins depending on whether you have small children, as there's plenty for them and they could want to stay a while!Overall I'd give it 71 out of 77.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/b6/bc/cf/cameron-023.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r670965298-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html
ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,aikanebelezrealtor,What a fun museum,50,23-Apr-19,"So, unfortunately, I didn't take a lot of photos but did take a lot of videos which I can't post on here. The FutureWorld exhibit was absolutely amazing. It was an interactive exhibit! So cool. The first room was a bunch of flowers and butterflies on all of the walls of the room (and the ceiling and floor), then the rain started and so did the amazement. The water would move around your feet, then when you moved, flowers would sprout up. It was so cool!The next room was the FUN room. There were so many things to do in this room and it was great for kids of all ages. The first thing was a slide with projected objects on it, when you touched them stuff would happen (the cherries would explode and ricochet off other objects). The next part was a table with wooden objects (mountains, water, trains, homes) that when placed on the table would create that object on the table. If you placed 2 of the water objects, it would create a river and if you put the train markers across from each other over the water, it would create a bridge and the train would travel between the two markers.Next up were drawing stations that you could color a pre-drawn picture then scan into the system so it would be projected onto the wall. There was a Hop Scotch course that was generated by 3 different computers and you actually jump down it. There was so much to do in this room, I couldn't take it all in.The Minimalism exhibit was very interesting, but we really should have done that first. It was so much more subdued and thought-provoking that it was a big change after the Future World exhibit.Overall, this was such a great museum, it was almost surprising that it was associated with the Marina Bay Sands hotel.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0d/08/e8/12/aikane-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r668475631-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

They went to museums or exhibutions in Paris, Barcelona, Rome, Amsterdam, small ones in Venice, Vicenza, Kobe etc you get the point and they were in awe with everything but my 4 yo said she didn't like the museum upstair except for the clock.

While much of it is child friendly (and there will be lots of families and kids) it is a joy to experience as well as to watch little kids enjoy. You realize these kids are growing up taking these feats of technology for granted. The exhibits are emotionally moving as well as playful.

From whole sensory rooms with surround interactive light shows to pictures you colour then scan and upload to interactive walls. BUT IT GOES ONE STEP FURTHER... -- it can take your scan upload it to another machine and print a card template for you to make a 3D MODEL! It was super great. I made one there and printed the rest to take back to the hotel to do later.

Lots of beautiful digital displays like the flowers and waterfall, and the slide looked quite cool as well.This is definitely more of a kids place, but we actually ended up having a lot of fun (kids at heart!). We also enjoyed the room where you can do crayon drawings that come to life on the big screens.Only thing I would suggest is that for the room with all the LED lights, most people going in just seem to want a good photo, but there was a staff member just standing in the middle the WHOLE time at the end, which was pretty annoying. I feel like that prolongs the people in there trying to get a good photo because then they are trying to find an angle where someone (aka the staff member) isn't just loitering in the background of all the photos. It's actually much more efficient just to have a staff member standing at the entrance and the exit of the room to tell people to hurry, than having someone stand in the centre and ruining people's shots.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/02/d0/04/sccs4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r623751764-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,maryyeo,"Package price for 3 exhibitions - Future World, Futures Imagined, Disney: Magic of Animation",40,2-Mar-20,"Purchased the family package for 2 adults + 2 children tickets, plus a 15% off using Standard Chartered credit card. Total of S$76 was worth it, considering we visited all three exhibitions and a workshop.Future World:Kiddos still loved the interactive art+science exhibits in the dark hall. Lots of fun sliding, crawling in tunnels, moving giant balls and ""landscaping"", creating digital hop scotches and jumping on them, walking into a room of glittery, floating crystals, etc. Skipped the coloring+projection part since they've tried that umpteen times here and elsewhere.Disney: Magic of Animation:This one probably excites the adults more, because you get to view the real drawings from 1930s all through the war in the 1940s till present day 2020. All the genuine drawings in here must be precious, not-for-sale, irreplaceable collectibles. Kids still enjoyed it here because of the short movie clips at each exhibit and a mini artwork area in the middle. Adults probably will enjoy it for the walk down memory lane and history. Truly, appreciating the art of animating, behind the art form.2219: Futures Imagined:Was expecting something futuristic and fun like the Future World next door, but was surprised that the overarching theme was pretty gloomy. The future imagined in this exhibition is a post-apocalyptic one, where most people have supposedly died and the remaining are struggling to survive in the dejected-looking streets left behind. Probably a good and realistic way to educate the kids (and ourselves) what the future may look like if we don't take care of our only habitable planet Earth, now.

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,Anna R,"Don't miss ""Space"" in Future World: Where Art Meets Science",40,1-Dec-19,"""Space"" is definitely the most attractive and memorable experience, part of the Future World exhibit. An immersive experience in ever changing colours and lights which amazes you (and may feel slightly disoriented as to space and dimensions, but it is a very safe space to be in).Children will enjoy all parts of this exhibit, especially Park, with huge interactive balls change colour.Personally, I found the 2219 Future Imagined exhibit quite depressing, presenting a dystopian view of the world (I bet everyone thinks: I'm glad I won't be around in 2219). Not really suitable for children.Overall, definitely worth a visit and marvel at how art and technology can be used together to create new visual experiences.

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,Anna R,"Don't miss ""Space"" in Future World: Where Art Meets Science",40,1-Dec-19,"""Space"" is definitely the most attractive and memorable experience, part of the Future World exhibit. An immersive experience in ever changing colours and lights which amazes you (and may feel slightly disoriented as to space and dimensions, but it is a very safe space to be in).Children will enjoy all parts of this exhibit, especially Park, with huge interactive balls change colour.Personally, I found the 2219 Future Imagined exhibit quite depressing, presenting a dystopian view of the world (I bet everyone thinks: I'm glad I won't be around in 2219). Not really suitable for children.Overall, definitely worth a visit and marvel at how art and technology can be used together to create new visual experiences.

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,rowenabaker,Psychedelic Indoor Playground For The Young & Restless,30,30-Nov-19,"Yes it is a iconic architectural landmark with a catchy and deceiving name.This lotus inspired, ingeniously named 'ArtScience Museum' isprivately owned by the Marina Bay Sands Group, who own the casino and hotel of the same name.Feng Shui is said to play an important hand in the design here and it literally does! Surely you can visualise the shape of a palm seemingly grasping or trying to contain something. Probably the hefty 19sgd entrance fees, LOL.The ArtScience Museum is far from being a proper museum per say, as are the Singapore National Museum, Art Museum and Science Centre, which are the real deal. Yes, there are often free exhibitions in collaboration with who's who, that are worthy of a visit here if you so happen to be in the neighbourhood. This is just one section perhaps dedicated to the subject of Arts and Science which is free. This in turn tempts one into imagining what's to see in the paid section of the ArtScience Museum. Many assume there should be more of the same, only better. Yet it is the actual ArtScience Museum that one gets dissapointed with and anyone who reads the grouses on on TripAdvisor should know if this is really their scene.Do not expect the ArtScience Museum to be at all like Singapore's mainstream museum. This is pretty much a OTT children's amusement centre in technicolor. Albeit, a fusion one at best. Not at all recommended for anyone above fourteen years of age.The only adults you will find inside the ArtScience Museum is likely to fall into one of the categories below. They would be :1. Tourist's who believed it was Museum of Art & Science. (They would be the unhappy in expressing their views here)2. Extroverts on social media chasing the selfies and instagram likes. ( Because it might be raining outside or they have nothing currently worthy to post)3. Parents/Grandparents (myself included) who accompany the young children. (They will be looking for the true art and science section of this museum only to find none)It is claimed the future is created here at the ArtScience Museum, but all I felt the entire time, was like I was walking thru a long psychedelic kaleidoscope. In all fairness thou, my fourteen month old grandson enjoyed himself here immensely attracted by all the movements and colors.Entertainment for some perhaps, but certainly not Science and if at all it is deemed as Art, it is Art without much content.Go if a myriad of moving projected images of luminous technicolor on the floor, walls, ceilings and slides is your kinda playground. Yes, that's right, there are two slides and I betcha this is the only museum with a indoor slide in the world.Older children who enjoy illustration can have their works projected on the walls while there and that's about as arty as it gets. Activities for the children will keep them occupied in a low light environment for some time without parents ever having to worry about sun stroke.Do remember to bring a camera for low light photography as no flash photography is allowed. One exits by walking thru a prism of blinding bright white LED lights set against mirrors. The grand finale of harsh lights to walk thru was a Christmas overload.Overall an entertaining time for young children. Hopefully, future playgrounds will not be as dark and mindless as this self proclaimed museum!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/15/4c/45/51/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r701089402-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,scubamom1234,More impressed than expected!,50,15-Sep-19,"The Art Museum is at the bay front area near the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. You can receive a discount for the tickets if you show your Marina Sands Club card. You must enter the elevator and go down to the basement to purchase tickets. Although there were 3 exhibits, we chose the Future World exhibit. I was more impressed than a child. The exhibits are soothing, and interactive. Our favorite part involved coloring on pre-printed sea animal pictures, then you place in the scanner and instantly they come to life on the wall. It's a lot of fun to see the turtle swimming, the jellyfish moving, sailfish swishing around...etc. It's new technology that I had not experienced. The same repeats in another room but with a city scene. Visitors can color cars, trucks, planes, and space ships.A separate wall has Oriental characters that once touched turn magically into animated animals on the wall.There are plenty of other activities for kids, all hands on interactive.On the weekends, when it's more crowded, there may controlled entrance times, so ask at the ticket counter.Overall, impressive and surprised by this fun museum.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r572354898-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

There was a lot about the background on Lewis Carroll and how Alice had came to life over the years in different countries. There were good opportunities for photos and lots on for young and old alike.Future meets Science - the exhibition gets the public involved with digital integration. However it is fairly crazy in parts with people standing and not moving or moving slowly on walls. Everyone eventually gets a turn at the main areas. The lights are very pretty and can leave you in awe.Floatopia - this has been put on the top floor and it's a blimp full of joy with giant inflations taking up space and you'd want to run up and cuddle it but you will be asked to step back from the artwork to a marked point for photos.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/fe/1a/21/helen-w.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r555920884-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

Each exhibition is priced individually, the general admission lets you enter the building foyer and gift concession only.2. The exhibitions are small, 5 minutes in each and you're done.3. They are eccentric (the transformative power of inflatable art ?!)4. If you've toddlers then the playground slides and lights in Futurewolrd they might be impressed (though much the same stuff is available in the shopping mall food court and at least you can eat/drink while you watch the kids and save money).Honestly there a much better things to do in Singapore and if art is your passion then go to the Art Museum where they actually have some art or the National Gallery or Civilizations Museum.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/db/04/88/peter-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r551727672-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

We were told it would be about 40 mins per exhibition; Futureworld was about that but the queues in Wonderland made it around 100 mins (about 50 mins of queuing). There was a huge queue to get tickets in the first place so recommend you get them online first (Klook is a good app).Futureworld. Ability to wonder through some of the exhibitions. Great for kids but not sure you would get much of it on your own. Some good ideas; the interactive slide and infinity mirror were highlights (although queue for mirror could have been managed much better as it was due to people taking photographs).Wonderland. An excellent idea well executed. This was the highlight and lowlight of the visit. Long queue (30 mins) just to get in to the exhibition. The exhibition was a great meld of tech and traditional artefacts. The best part is the interactive screen where you take a picture of your face and then see it emerge on the screen on the body of one of the Queen's soldiers - its better than it sounds! Huge queue for the Mad Hatters Tea Party (another 30 mins).

I found it a bit pointless to be honest. It would have been much more interesting if there was more information on the history and process behind the film production and the people involved.Unfortunately the experience was spoiled somewhat when we tried to feed our young daughter with formula milk - we were told that it was not allowed inside the exhibition hall (even for breastfeeding babies apparently) and we had to go all the way round the exhibition to exit and then come back in again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r454156500-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

This place is split into different galleries with different exhibits and you need to choose which ones to see.There are lots of interesting interactive displays but they are mostly taken up by children and as an adult you can't get in to many of them. At one point I started to worry that it was actually a kids attraction and I'd come by mistake so I left a couple of the galleries without seeing much at all.As a solo adult or couple I wouldn't bother with this one unless you have time to kill but if you have inquisitive youngsters then I think they'd love this.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r447620265-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,rowenabaker,Psychedelic Indoor Playground For The Young & Restless,30,30-Nov-19,"Yes it is a iconic architectural landmark with a catchy and deceiving name.This lotus inspired, ingeniously named 'ArtScience Museum' isprivately owned by the Marina Bay Sands Group, who own the casino and hotel of the same name.Feng Shui is said to play an important hand in the design here and it literally does! Surely you can visualise the shape of a palm seemingly grasping or trying to contain something. Probably the hefty 19sgd entrance fees, LOL.The ArtScience Museum is far from being a proper museum per say, as are the Singapore National Museum, Art Museum and Science Centre, which are the real deal. Yes, there are often free exhibitions in collaboration with who's who, that are worthy of a visit here if you so happen to be in the neighbourhood. This is just one section perhaps dedicated to the subject of Arts and Science which is free. This in turn tempts one into imagining what's to see in the paid section of the ArtScience Museum. Many assume there should be more of the same, only better. Yet it is the actual ArtScience Museum that one gets dissapointed with and anyone who reads the grouses on on TripAdvisor should know if this is really their scene.Do not expect the ArtScience Museum to be at all like Singapore's mainstream museum. This is pretty much a OTT children's amusement centre in technicolor. Albeit, a fusion one at best. Not at all recommended for anyone above fourteen years of age.The only adults you will find inside the ArtScience Museum is likely to fall into one of the categories below. They would be :1. Tourist's who believed it was Museum of Art & Science. (They would be the unhappy in expressing their views here)2. Extroverts on social media chasing the selfies and instagram likes. ( Because it might be raining outside or they have nothing currently worthy to post)3. Parents/Grandparents (myself included) who accompany the young children. (They will be looking for the true art and science section of this museum only to find none)It is claimed the future is created here at the ArtScience Museum, but all I felt the entire time, was like I was walking thru a long psychedelic kaleidoscope. In all fairness thou, my fourteen month old grandson enjoyed himself here immensely attracted by all the movements and colors.Entertainment for some perhaps, but certainly not Science and if at all it is deemed as Art, it is Art without much content.Go if a myriad of moving projected images of luminous technicolor on the floor, walls, ceilings and slides is your kinda playground. Yes, that's right, there are two slides and I betcha this is the only museum with a indoor slide in the world.Older children who enjoy illustration can have their works projected on the walls while there and that's about as arty as it gets. Activities for the children will keep them occupied in a low light environment for some time without parents ever having to worry about sun stroke.Do remember to bring a camera for low light photography as no flash photography is allowed. One exits by walking thru a prism of blinding bright white LED lights set against mirrors. The grand finale of harsh lights to walk thru was a Christmas overload.Overall an entertaining time for young children. Hopefully, future playgrounds will not be as dark and mindless as this self proclaimed museum!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/15/4c/45/51/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r444433782-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

Wonderland; I didn't get much from this not being a massive fan of the film's or books some interesting stuff but nonetheless.

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,scourtnadge,Great ideas (Wonderland great) but queues too long,30,29-Aug-19,There are 3 main exhibitions - we opted for Wonderland and Futureworld. We were told it would be about 40 mins per exhibition; Futureworld was about that but the queues in Wonderland made it around 100 mins (about 50 mins of queuing). There was a huge queue to get tickets in the first place so recommend you get them online first (Klook is a good app).Futureworld. Ability to wonder through some of the exhibitions. Great for kids but not sure you would get much of it on your own. Some good ideas; the interactive slide and infinity mirror were highlights (although queue for mirror could have been managed much better as it was due to people taking photographs).Wonderland. An excellent idea well executed. This was the highlight and lowlight of the visit. Long queue (30 mins) just to get in to the exhibition. The exhibition was a great meld of tech and traditional artefacts. The best part is the interactive screen where you take a picture of your face and then see it emerge on the screen on the body of one of the Queen's soldiers - its better than it sounds! Huge queue for the Mad Hatters Tea Party (another 30 mins). An interesting display but if queue anymore than 10 mins I would skip,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/c1/5b/d7/scourtnadge.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r426245026-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

We did the full exhibit tour and there were three open when we were there. The really wasn't any science link to any of them, but the one on balloons did try to add some technical aspects. There were several high-tech video installations, but all the focus was on visuals and not the underlying technology. Our daughters enjoyed the interactive drawing parts and playing with the balls that change color based on how fast they are going, but as other reviewers say, there isn't much of particular interest for adults. The Wonderland exhibit was heavily hyped, but it was mainly a presentation of all the books/movies based on the story so more history than anything else.

The counter staff, Catherine, was not very helpful and undeniably rude. If not for the kids looking forward, we would have turned back (separate feedback has already been conveyed to MBS). The Future World exhibition was cool, innovative and educational. The kids loved the interactive segments and enjoyed themselves. Wonderland, however, promised much, but was not really up to par. Sure, the exhibits on original literary works of Lewis Caroll and videos of first ever live adaptions of the classic story was interesting, but there seemed to something missing. The map provided also had riddles to keep the kids busy while they maneuvered the exhibitions but they soon lost interest. The digital interactive Mad Hatters Tea Party was a non-event despite the hype. Save for projected graphics, it was nothing to shout about.

In between these two photogenic spaces are countless activities just for children, including a small slide, crayon drawing stations and a ball pit. Even though they were all in gleeful use by a large school group, it was hard to ascribe any of these activities with the artistic or scientific merit suggested by the museum's name.

The Alice in Wonderland exhibit was done very well and I am glad that I added that onto my regular ticket. You get to see from start to finish how Alice in Wonderland has progressed, and go through some obstacles as well. It is a very fun exhibit and I would certainly do this one again.The main exhibit however was a bit dull. It is great for kids so if you have kids this is at least half a day. I saw plenty of families playing around with a lot of the different objects they have throughout. For adults though I would say this isn't a must-do while in Singapore. I went here while it was raining and it was perfect for that. Besides the light display that I am sure you have seen all over Instagram there isn't too much more to it.

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,boabin,Light-tastic! More enjoyable for kids!,30,31-Oct-17,"After seeing this museum from the outside last year, I finally took the plunge and went to see the happenings of the inside.When you walk through the doors, head for the elevator straight ahead or take the escalator on the left, that will take you B1. There isn't a huge sign, one on the side of the escalator but hard to miss because of the coffee shop. Also, the staff hanging around don't seem to want to help those who don't know.However, that was just upstairs - the folks downstairs are nicer! :DeCome here and be overwhelmed with lights, everywhere. Even take some time and chill out on a beanbag to have a quick nap or update your friends. From there until the last light section is mainly for kids. There are lots of activities for them!I was expecting something a little more, it's kinda boring if you aren't a kid. And the last sections with all the lights that change colour is the only appealing area.

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,429vikkiw,Too expensive but amazing structure.,30,31-Oct-17,Amazing structure however once inside you don't really feel the shape of the outside of the building. So much better from outside. Spend your time relaxing sitting around the lily ponds below the structure admiring the building and all around it. We took the lift to the top floor hoping there would be some sort of view of the building or a viewing platform but nothing. The box office and galleries are mostly on the lower levels as you enter. It is very expensive to enter any of the exhibitions so we did not bother at all. There was a free wildlife trail using hand held virtual reality screens that was fantastic. It is from WWF Singapore and was a great little wander around. There are so many more fun and interesting places to visit in Singapore than are just as good or better and definitely less expensive. Check what exhibitions are on before you go and how much it is to enter and then you can decide.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/eb/e9/1c/vikki-w.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r641992607-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,Wottinger,Childish,30,12-Oct-17,"We had a very poor introduction to purchasing tickets for the Art Science Museum.As a Sands Reward Club member, I am entitled to receive a free adult ticket for every adult ticket purchased, up to two every month.On Fridays, up to four children are entitled to enter the Museum free of charge for every adult ticket purchased. The staff were obstinate that I couldn't receive the free tickets for my two children. This is despite that there is no term or condition that prevents this. They stated that it would be combining offers or promotions. Yet this is something that surely would have been contemplated and explicitly excluded, but is definitely not. Maybe I am the first person to do this. They argued back and forwards, but refused to have a senior manager come speak to me. Its a Singaporean thing!However, the shnorrer in me was not going to back down.Eventually a manager did come after an hour. I had one question for her; what is the cost of an ""All Access"" adult ticket on Fridays with the free children's tickets when paying with my NETS card? the answer was SGD$38.00 less 15% equals SGD$32.30. You see, in September there was a special of 15% discount with the NETS card.Ah Ha! I had them and they knew the game was up. This is because it would be combining offers or promotions which they had wrongly and incessantly argued.We went to all the exhibitions and completed the tour in a little over two hours.Great for children, not too long or in depth.

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,etangpeace,Can get crowded and affects the experience,30,24-Jun-16,"I only went to the Future World exhibition that was said to be well suited for kids. I brought my 4.5-year old, excited about all the kids-friendly activities I had read about...However, the place is a little small, and when there are loads of children (as there was when I was there it being the last day of the school holidays), it can get a little overwhelming and I think that to accommodate so many children, some features had to be cut away, such as the self-design feature of the hopscotch, which was one of the original highlights of the exhibition...I think the staff was also overwhelmed and I find many of them, sadly, to be quite grouchy. Better trained staff who are more children-friendly and understanding might be better? They shushed the kids going down the slide and seemed to just be policing the area rather than helping guests to enjoy the experience. This is my first time there so it's just based on my one experience which might not be accurate...Other interesting activities include the colouring of vehicles/sea creatures which when scanned, go up onto the screen. While some activities are intuitive, not all are - like the dragon that comes out to be attacked by the aircraft - and I feel more instructions/engagement with staff could help. Another activity was the Table of Little Men, which was very interactive too. The colourful balls which my daughter pushed across with great excitement was also a highlight for her...Overall I spent about 2.5 hours there (out of which at least half an hour was spent going up and down the simple slide haha)...Don't think I could do much longer...",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r432611616-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

See review of light show for further info and places to watch from.The Art building contains a number of hands on exhibitions several are stunning as well as Art from local artists. The way the building winds around and operates on the different wings and levels is brilliant.

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,Kymmethy,"Beautiful building, interesting exhibits,but kind of small.",30,16-Sep-15,"I battled my way walking to the Marina Bay from my hotel during a freak thunderstorm and heavy down pour determined to visit this museum, you can also access by metro and I think the buses stop here aswell. And kinda struggled to fill my time if I'm honest. I paid $30 SG for entry into The Deep and Dreamworks exhibits; personally by UK standards I don't think that's very expensive, but can see how it would be if you're travelling with a family.I loved The Deep and spent over an hour wandering through the exhibit, I found the Dreamworks exhibit over quite quickly and the rest of the museum much smaller in comparison and nothing else here seemed to grab my attention. Maybe I had just over estimated how much time I could realistically potter about in here for. I think the Dreamworks exhibit was more enjoyed by the children I saw there and the layout didn't really appeal to me, having to drag out the 40mins I spent looking around and messing with interactive drawing computers. I much preferred The Deep exhibit and loved dawdling around in the dark looking at all the scary dead fish (but that probably says more about me as a person). I probably should have just paid the cheaper entry fee for this exhibit but I had time to kill and might not have gotten my voucher for a free drink if I had done that.The Singapore stories exhibit added some local cultural and historical knowledge but by this time I was a losing attention span, and the 4th floor holds information on design inspiration for the architecture of the building which is pretty cool,but these are much smaller feeling areas. Overall all the different parts of the museum had their own unique appeal and interactive learning activities, but I struggled to fill a few hours here nevermind an afternoon, or try and make this an all day event.

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,MrDavetheSarks,Timing is everything,30,22-Aug-15,"Having discovered this place through my research, I had pretty much decided that this was one of the places that I was going to visit while in Singapore. The thing is that with many of these museums you need to time yourself properly otherwise you won't find any exhibitions here of any interest. This was the case when I visited, namely because I wanted something uniquely Singaporean as opposed to something that might (or might not) land up in a museum in Australia (or elsewhere). However they did have one interesting exhibit, and that was the history of Singapore as told by its major newspaper, the Straights Time. It was quite an interesting half-an-hour, however the other two exhibitions really held no interest for me.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/09/9a/02/f5/mrdavethesarks.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r586673051-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html
ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,JamesTanSL,ArtScience Museum ... It really depends on what highlight touring exhibitions are on show when you visit,30,12-Aug-15,"Opened in February 2011, in a uniquely lotus shaped building with ten skyward extension, it either look like a pair of cupped hands or a blossoming lotus flower.The ArtScience Museum is part of the entire Marina Bay Sands complex in Singapore and the building itself have become as iconic as the '3 legged' MBS hotel behind.Privately owned and operated by MBS, the museum celebrates creativity at Its best through art, science, design, media, architecture and technology.With 1 permanent exhibition on the above, the other 3 galleries are for touring exhibition.At my time of visit, it was Singapore Then and Now, Dreamworks Animation and The Deep.Singapore Then and Now is set up by Singapore Press Holdings, the folks who have been printing our newspapers since then 1845. This exhibition is a highlights of key events in Singapore's history through an array of news headlines and news clippings. It is part of the Singapore Golden Jubilee Celebration.The most enjoyable visit for me is to Dreamworks Animation exhibition. It is great to see up close the design process, props, storyboards, art works of some of our favorite characters up close.The Deep is the other exhibition that I enjoyed. Lost of deep sea creatures and specimens on display.Overall, in my humble opinion, a visit to this museum really depends on what exhibition is showing and if it really peak your interest, otherwise, it will be a hefty price to pay just to visit this place.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/ec/07/fa/jamestansl.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r556848606-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html
ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,insano10,Vaguely interesting exhibits to pass an afternoon,30,24-Jul-15,"When I went there was an exhibition about Dreamworks animated movies and one about Deep Sea.The Dreamworks one was disappointing as I was hoping for information about the animation technology but it was mostly just pictures of the different characters. Probably best for small children who know the movies well.The Deep Sea one was more interesting. If it was less crowded and there were fewer people with stupid selfie sticks taking pictures of themselves for 20mins in front of each exhibit the experience may have been more enjoyable. It amazes me at the beautiful and interesting places people go to and all they want to do is take pictures of themselves.

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,abc_at_Huntsville,"Great disparity between ""permanent"" and ""temporary"" exhibits",30,16-Jul-15,"We visited here in July 2015. I had expected very little from this iconic ""hand-shaped"" or ""lotus flower shaped"" museum, but ""Wow!"" I was pleasantly surprised. Exiting the Marina Bay Shoppes and walking outdoors to enter the museum, I noticed the clever design of the museum, which gave the perception of openness while the tall, overhanging ""bowl shape"" of the Museum actually protected you from rain (it was raining heavily when we went). The lotus pond with bright purple blooms leading up to the entrance can't be missed either. Perhaps the only pitfall of the museum's design was the upper floors that make up the ""flower"" has very little functional space for exhibits. The larger temporary exhibits, definitely the main draw of the museum, is actually underground and not really part of the museum's iconic ""shape"".As with many Singapore attractions, residents & citizens get a discount on tickets. Definitely get the ""full"" ticket which allows you to tour the temporary exhibitions (when we visited, a deep sea and Dreamworks animation exhibit) as well as the dismal ""ArtScience Galeries"" upstairs (more on that later).I was definitely amazed at ""The Deep"" exhibit (one of the temporary exhibits), which showcased a variety of deep sea specimens and their unique environmental adaptions to the hostile life in the ocean depths. First of all, the galleries were dark, quiet, and peaceful, allowing you to really (pardon the pun) ""immerse"" yourself in the ocean depths that these unique creatures live in. While there were others visiting, they were nowhere near as noisy as the patrons at...other museums...helping to really set a nice ""vibe"". The darkness of the rooms, while meant to evoke the depths of the ocean, may be an issue if you've been in the sun all day: my dad bumped into a wall, thinking it was a path. The specimens themselves (stored in glass cases) range from the ""typical"" anglerfish and orange roughy to the bizarre: ""glass ball"" creatures (best way I can describe them), transparent shrimp, and much more. But what perhaps impressed me the most was the detail they went to describing each and every specimen: at least a paragraph or more for each one. For someone who appreciates scientific information and interesting details, I really enjoyed the exhibit and afterwards, my appreciation for the deep ocean really grew. Some the specimens can be rather grotesque, as is with many deep-sea animals; it may not be advisable to bring young children to this exhibit.The other temporary exhibit was a Dreamworks animation gallery, where you could tour through the process animators go through to design their countless animated movies. Fans of Kung Fu Panda, How to Train You Dragon, Madagascar, Shrek, etc. will enjoy the items on display, which include many scale models of characters & buildings used by the animators. There were also computer displays where you could try your hand at animation or experiment with various CGI effects (which I enjoyed). I never really grew up with these films, so it was hard for me to really say ""Wow!"" over this exhibit. But still, a very impressive display, and perfect for the whole family.Perhaps the only let-down was when we visited the ""ArtScience Galleries"", which are actually inside the ""flower"" of the museum. First of all, it was empty, save for the janitor and one other family. There wasn't really anymore than a short film about ""invention"" and ""innovation"" and that sort of thing (it wasn't even that memorable), and an unimpressive display about well-known inventions and their history. It seemed part of these galleries were closed off for renovation...but still! A very underwhelming end to our visit. At the ticket counter, be sure your ticket includes access to the temporary exhibits--otherwise you will be very disappointed.All in all, this place was a pleasant surprise, which I find is very rare for a ""new"" Singapore attraction. Obviously this review will become obsolete after new temporary exhibits are installed, but we had a fabulous experience here and would love to visit again--can't wait to see what they have next!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r549965651-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

Kids running everywhere, screaming, it's like a zoo rather than an art museum.I bought a pass for 2 exhibition, skipping the wonderland one, for SG32, it was not worth it for its display and the atmosphere.The floating utopia was alright nothing major.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/40/2b/75/man-u-canuck.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r363056874-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html
ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,margaritak898,"Wish I was told that Future World exhibition is for children, NOT for adults (I DID ask for help at ticketing center)",20,9-Jul-19,"It was very disappointing to pay almost $40 for my husband and I to get into the exhibition called 'úFuture World'ù and discover that most of what they have there is evidently for kids - colorouring books, a slide, big colorful inflated balloons/balls to jump on, etc.I asked a person who works at the ticketing center for advice - whether it is a good choice to specifically get into this exhibition, and she said it was the best option. Clearly she saw we were a couple of adults with no children around us, so I wish she helped me pick a better option for the two of us.'úCrystal universe'ù installation at the end is beautiful (that's the picture they have on a poster) but is not even enjoyable to walk through as you have to wait in a queue for a very long time as people in front take their sweet time to snap a million photos. That space should be better organizied and maybe controlled with respect towards all people who'd like to enjoy it. It looks fantastic on photos and promotional videos - but you certainly won't have that experience when you are there...When at the exit I asked if they would allow us to see another exhibition (explaining the situation, that I asked for help and was recommended to go to the kids interactive exhibition) all I received was a shoulder shrug and told to go to visitors center and 'úmaybe they will help me, I am not sure'ù (quoting).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r362703553-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html
ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,wouterfouche,Floating Flop,20,4-Jul-19,I can not understand why this is a permanent exhibition at the Artsience Museum unless there were unused space and the owners needed to earn some revenue for it!The facts on the wall posters were somewhat interesting but the items on exhibition were really bad and uninteresteni. Looked like some oversized blow-up dolls. Only the big balloon that looked like the moon was worth looking at...the rest pretty uninteresting.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/11/23/cf/cf/wouterfouche.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r361869606-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html
ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,907pamc,Poor customer service/staff,20,17-Jun-19,"Got the all access tickets...but got confused on the timing specified on the ticket. I assume it was for the Alice in wonderland...but i need to make sure with someone. I asked 4 people, and they dont have any clue and ask me to go to the ticketing office. Those staff i approached are manning the exhibits, which i assume...they should know what tickets are they accepting.Anywy, we went ahead with my assumption and proceed with Alice first. Then we wento for lunch, and went back for Future and Utopia.Alice in wonderland is ok if u have little kids in tow. But the tea party, very unfriendly staff (guy). Maybe the guy assumes everyone knows the rules. Tsk tsk, he even argued to one tourist. He is askng for 4 more people to take seats, the foreigner group is 3, so basically she can. But its like he shooed them away, until the girl argued...then they were able to take the seats.Future world is ok, the last part... staff always makes you to walk and do not just stand...how can people take their photo???! And of course people will understand the queue, everyone wants good photo.Floating Utopia- you can skip this.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r280034484-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html
ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,celeanorc,Not so future world,20,12-Mar-19,"I went there for the future world exhibition with a friend. The staff was a bit unfriendly in the string lights room. The staff at the entrance asked us to rudely to put our bags in front of us so our bags wont hit any of the lights, which is understandable but the attitude really made us feel unwelcoming. They kept asking us to move forward even though it was quite empty. We just wanted to appreciate the different shades of lighting. Also the passage way was a bit narrow so our backs accidentally touched the string light once but we already immediately walked off, the staff rushed to us and told us off impolitely. We really felt like we were in military school and kept getting told where to go and when to move. You could really feel the staff did not want you to stay there even though there was barely anyone.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/16/5a/40/61/celeanorc.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r277716296-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html
ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,SeshKomanduri,Average place,20,11-Jan-19,"There is a lot of hype that has been built about this place. There is nothing really experiential here. A lot of optics and very little content. It is more like an amusement place for kids (and a very expensive one!).At the end, we were left wondering what this was all about - it was neither an experience center, nor a museum in the true sense. We felt very disappointed.Even my 9 year old was not impressed!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/ce/default-avatar-2020-7.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r268961458-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,thecozybackpacker,Terrible 24 min experience for adults,20,28-Dec-18,"The entire exhibition took us 24 min to experience. This is not a artmuseum, this is an expensive playground/kindergarten. Everything is made for kids, great if you are a family- terrible if you're not.Great if you have kids age 1-11. We couldnt interact or appriciate anything because of the hundreds of kids screaming, running and falling in front of you. The noice was so loud that We left.And the crystal universe- it is about 5m long and staff rush you through it so you cant stay more than 1,5 minute.Worst spending in Singapore.

It had lots of information and reported all the movies and their release dates...but i could have found that on wikipedia.The statues and displays were very cringeworthy and poorly made.

ArtScience Museum at Marina Bay Sands,jurganito,"Very poor, not the usual standard of the ArtScience Museum",20,8-Sep-18,"For a 10 year Marvel Studio exhibition this was very poor and a complete waste of money and time. To showcase the movies and its main characters you'd expect at least various movie props, costumes, set pieces, etc but nothing like it. It's a very short meander past plaster versions of the main characters and very little explanation of their universe along side it. We were expecting something like the Harry Potter exhibition that was here some years ago and where you could really relive the movies. Even if it had half the experience of Harry Potter it would've been worth it but this was terrible and hopefully not an indication of future ArtScience exhibitions.The stitched together trailer of several Marvel movies at the end in a special ""theatre"" room really said it all.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/09/de/bb/ab/jurganito.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r171266780-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html
