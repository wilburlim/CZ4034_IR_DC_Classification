Flower Dome,NigelG407,Ready for Chinese New Year,50,25-Jan-21,The Flower Dome is all laid out for Lunar New Year and a wonderful display of dahlias surrounds the installations.Of course all the diversity and the sculptures and artworks are there and can't be missed by the new visitor. The Chapungu are a series of stone carvings from Zimbabwe which add a dimension of art to Botany. Statues are primarily of birds and people.The sculptures associated with Alice in Wonderland and Pooh Bear are not to be missed also.I have given a selection of images mostly from the New Year installation but be sure to check it all out.

Flower Dome,glenn70foodie,Newest floral exhibit,50,10-Mar-20,"The most recent botanical dome at Gardens by the Bay is just outstanding. Its features enthralled our group of over 70's friends for half a day. There are indoor fountains, fossilized carvings, delicate rain forest frog enclosures, and open glassed viewing walls everywhere we looked. The glass roof soars hundred feet above the entire enclosure. When we fitted our 3 D glasses, and buckled ourselves into the comfy theatre chairs, we were immersed into the world seen by a dragonfly whizzing throughout these very gardens. We felt the spray as we zoomed through the misty waterfalls, and got dizzy as we swooped around giant trees. This 20 minute climax lifted our spirits and enhanced the entire outing. Should you want to see all three domes, allow a full day. Last August we waited till 8 pm to see the coreographed lights and musical fountains displays, but sadly these have been cancelled this time due to the blasted virus . Don't let this stop you roaming all three spectacular .domes.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d4400784-r750189709-Flower_Dome-Singapore.html

Flower Dome,Soon Joo K,A beautiful Eden within our little Red dot.,50,1-Feb-20,"I always drop by the Flower Dome whenever they have new exhibits on display.For this month of January 2020, it is Dahlia dreams (with Lunar New Year Festivities).I can only sum it up as this is THE place you want to be at, during this hot weather.The horticulturists and botanists likely did the right combination this time, with a good mix of flora and festive sculpture displays, like the 12 Chinese Zodiac signs.Each of the displays are so cute and adorable, no matter if you view them during the day or evening night.Think the only slight blemish is that there were only two guided tour groups at 11am and 3pm on weekdays.I actually attended one where I was the only guest!But the guided tour was informative and gave me more information on the displays and the significance.Strongly recommended for tourists (especially first timers) to Singapore!Tip: if you can spare time to come back within the same day, please do remember to ask the staff at the exit for a re-entry stamp.The last entry is 8.30pm at night.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/9a/03/31/soon-joo-k.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d4400784-r742256993-Flower_Dome-Singapore.html

It's just as big and beautiful as the cloud forest except there is no waterfall. We got to it late and only had an hour before it closed so we had to rush and we were already tired from walking in the gardens and cloud forest.

Flower Dome,VRNPerth,Flower dome.,50,13-Jan-20,"It is definitely worth the entrance price. You can either buy a ticket for each of the three attractions or a combination of two or three of them. The Flower Dome, the Cloud Forest and I don't remember the third one. Buying a combination of three entitles you to use the shuttle service running inside the gardens. You can still avail of the shuttle without this, but by buying a ticket each time you want to use the shuttle.As with the Super Tree grove I don't have much to say about the attraction. It is really beautiful. We were on a trip by ourselves for the first time in 18-20 years. The kids have now grown up enough to travel by themselves or be left at home. We spent a couple of hours inside the Flower dome just walking around looking at the various displays. No hassling kids, no hunger pangs, no toilet breaks.But please be aware that going on a weekend will mean that there are a whole lot of girls/women who work in Singapore who come here for a picnic and will be taking selfies at every possible point in the dome. Walking around can be a bit tricky, avoiding photo bombing will need to be a skill you'll need to learn quickly.Am posting a few photos of the place, instead of saying anything much about the attraction itself.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d4400784-r738839435-Flower_Dome-Singapore.html

In fact every visitors would leave with many photos on their phones or cameras clamoring for a good shot here and there.There is also a cafe inside this place. Very cosy and relaxing for a cup of coffee/tea, or for some reflections in a 'flowery' environment. There is also a big function hall that seem open for corporate booking.

Flower Dome,fajaradiartha,Dome of plants,50,30-Dec-19,I advise going here first before Cloud Forest. The Flower Dome is simply a collection of plants from many countries.

At around $20 for admission I feel like that should be included. The displays of Mediterranean gardens from Africa, California and elsewhere were interesting but unless you're a true botanist - or take the audio tour which would have probably made it more interesting ' it wasn't fascinating. BUT, the 'Poinsettia Wishes' Garden Trail special exhibit made it worthwhile.

The displays change depending on what is being shown. We has the Rhododendrons on display in one of the sections.It is both pushchair and wheelchair friendly, but can get very busy and crowded.The only offputting for me was those inconsiderate visitors who wanted selfies with each display or wanted family photographs as they went around blocking the walkways.Worth a visit - fully recommended",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/e9/8c/a6/nigel-h.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d4400784-r721148645-Flower_Dome-Singapore.html

Although the tree dragon, and various animals made out of dried tree branches kept the little ones interested while the adults appreciated the colourful arrangements. The purple gorilla caught their attention as well, popular photo shoot that one. In fact, you cannot stop taking photo after photo, it just gets to you and you want to remember it.Dont forget to ask for your free gift as you buy your entrance ticket, you will get a pack of souvenir cards that you can send to the rellies to make them jealous, or keep them yourself as a memento of a great day.

This alone makes a visit all the worth while. Another standout attraction was the scent garden, where visitors are encouraged to enchant themselves with the smell of various orchids.Hidden among much of the flora are alluring sculptures, many of these being made of natural tree vegetation, and unlike their real wildlife forms, are more than willing to be photographed, which you will probably find yourself doing with considerable frequency.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0c/52/5f/8b/fyingkiwi.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d4400784-r690207690-Flower_Dome-Singapore.html

Flower Dome,weisbrew1,Orchid garden is better,30,22-Nov-18,"The Flower Dome is one of four parts of the Gardens by the bay complex. It was my least favorite - not bad, but not exceptional. If I had to choose between this dome and the National Orchid Garden at the Singapore Botanical Gardens, the Orchids win out. But when combined with the other three parts of the Gardens by the bay, namely the Cloud Forest dome and the Supertree light and sound show, I would be happy with the Gardens by the Bay. If you have limited time at the Gardens by the Bay, go to the Cloud Forest dome first. The 15 minute long light and sound show at 7:45 and 8:45 (check website for times) would be my second pick, followed by the Flower dome.

Flower Dome,Danielle G,Skip this and just see the Cloud forest,30,11-Nov-18,Unfortunately we happened to visit whilst the current display was being changed over and some of flowers were starting to die. Overall it was ok & a nice way to escape the heat but I found it underwhelming compared to the National Orchid Garden in the Botanic Gardens.

Flower Dome,Sinag,Skip this one if your own city has a nice botanical garden.,30,7-Nov-18,"For someone who had the privilege to live in cities with lovely botanical gardens - indoors or outdoors, it's hard to appreciate why the plants in the Flower Dome are in an airconditioned space in a tropical city. Yes, the blooms are lovely. Yes, perhaps, this is a real attraction for a certain group of tourists. Most of the flora are from temperate areas except for the desert plants and cacti, I guess. Most people I see visiting this place are from temperate countries. I don't necessarily think they will be gushing over the blooms in this place.The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are pretty symbolic in reminding people that Singapore is a bubble. Great for a visit, has all the first world comforts, but probably ambivalent to reality in other parts of Southeast Asia. So, if you are traveling in the region, please don't just stop in Singapore - which is a real amazing international hub.

Definitely bring a jacket, if you plan to stay any longer.- It is called ""Flower Dome"", however, the ratio of actual flowers compared to other green plants.

Flower Dome,joyeuxlife,Wasted My Time Here,10,27-Feb-19,What seems to be remnants of the Chinese New Year exhibit were in the form of wilted flowers. The flow of the paths do not make sense.

Flower Dome,carolinelundberg71,Disappointment. No flowers ð²,10,12-Dec-18,The flower dome was certainly a disappointment we were expecting to see flowers and flowers and flowers but they made it into at Christmas attraction with a lot of Christmas decorations.

Flower Dome,Pat J,Not for nature lovers,10,27-Nov-18,"If you're in Singapore'a country with the most beautiful botanical gardens and where lush beauty is everywhere'why spend time and money on a tacky, amusement style theme park 'garden'?

Flower Dome,ajc907,DEFINE BOREDOM,10,26-Oct-18,Flower Dome means BOREDOMe! trust me.. this is the most boring part of our trip. I suggest that you should pay for the Cloud Forest/Dome instead of going here. We enjoyed the cloud forest simply because it is airconditioned. Realtalk.

Flower Dome,Spongemaster,Piece of heaven,10,2-Mar-17,"Just visited Flower Done, truly exceptional indoor gardens. Temperature surprisingly cool, but not chilly.

Flower Dome,Beverly R,"Boring, not worth the money",10,22-Nov-16,"In light of the big deal that is made of this attraction, and given the size of the dome, I expected a fantastic exhibit.

Flower Dome,Ramya B,Not worth the money,10,15-Oct-16,This place.is not worth the money. Also why will I want to see plants in a AC environment. It's a garden in a garden .

Flower Dome,watashiwaevie,Totally not worth the admission fee,10,4-Jul-16,"Went there with my mom for the Sakura (cherry blossoms) festival in March. We were sorely disappointed. The flowers looked uninspiring and like they were nearing their wilting stage. Not to mention, it was unbelievably crowded on a weekend and what was supposed to be a nice treat for my mom became a jostle with the huge selfie-taking crowds and long snaking queues. If you want to view flowers, best to view them in their native land where they grew from the soil, in their suitable climate. Uprooting plants from their native land and displaying them somewhere else is always a bad idea. I've learnt my lesson. :(",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d4400784-r388915539-Flower_Dome-Singapore.html

Probably the only saving grace is that the place was cool, and a nice respite from the humid, tropical heat.
