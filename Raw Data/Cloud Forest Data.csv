Cloud Forest,KYHENG,30 meters tall man made waterfall,40,14-Mar-21,"This to me is the highlight of the exhibits here and could have been arranged such that it is the last to see. Still it is great to have it at the entrance.Within the dome, the exhibits are arranged by floors, starting at level 7. You got to take the lift up to 6 and climb the rest of the way via staircase.Best part to me is the suspended walkway where you could look over and best floor is the cavern which is at one of the lower floors.This whole experience could have been improved if the waterfall is seen at the end of the trip, with the sound for the waterfall acting as a very powerful tease the entire time you are inside.Bestest experience here is the air conditioned which is a welcoming oasis after wandering around the outdoor displays at Gardens by the Bay.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1c/c4/8b/75/kyheng.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d4400781-r784518454-Cloud_Forest-Singapore.html

Cloud Forest,Chelsea B,Busy but amazing,50,3-Feb-21,"known for it's impressive 115ft waterfall. As soon as you walk in the sight greets you, as well as the hundreds of tourists gathering at the bottom for a photograph. Having had a relatively quiet morning we found the next leg of our day extremely busy. I made the mistake of wearing a maxi dress to the gardens and had people constantly standing on my dress.In the cloud forest you follow a walkway that snakes around a plant clad mountain. This does streamline the crowds but there were no points where it was too overwhelming. Despite the hot and humid weather outside the conservatory was very cool to walk around and a welcome respite.

Cloud Forest,Grover R,The Most Amazing Garden Exhibit in the World,50,1-Feb-21,"It is amazingly difficult to put in to words this attraction. It is a MUST SEE if you go to Singapore and for me it was the best and most amazing part of Gardens by the Bay. I have been to all kinds of gardens, including enclosed ones. Most of the time it is to keep the plants warm enough, here it is to keep them cool enough. There is simply nothing like it in the world.You walk in and are greeted by an incredible green waterfall and then you walk around this verdant mountain of various plants. Every turn is unbelievable. There are full grown trees and incredible views through the glass enclosure and this is before the main attraction when you ride the elevator 7 stories to the top of the mountain to begin a leisurely walk down. Again the views and the plants are amazing. The pictures will show you but they dont do it justice.

Cloud Forest,WanderingWithUsTwo,Unlike anything else,50,13-May-20,The cloud forest is one of two gardens housed in the plaza and is the world's largest column-less greenhouse. We booked this through Klook as a bundled package that also included the flower garden and outdoor walkway for 22 USD per person. The forest offers free tours for groups of 5 or more but you can also venture on your own in around 1.5 hours. When you first enter there'll be large crowds trying to get pictures so it may be hard to get one without people in it. Once you get past there you are able to walk all around the base and when you're ready can begin your ascent towards the top. There are a series of escalators and elevators that will take you up to the top. Once you leave the ground level you will no longer be allowed to go back so keep that in mind. You'll be able to visit the different levels on your way up which give unique perspectives of the waterfalls. Since it is a greenhouse you'll be able to see through and get an interesting perspective of a forest hidden in the city. As you complete your ascent you'll then begin going down the various levels which have some educational information on the forests. We were happy to see several educational pieces about our carbon footprint as humans and how we can help reduce it to protect these marvels. Afterwards if you purchased a flower garden ticket you'll just cross the walkway outside to enter the other exhibit and you can re-enter with a hand stamp to either one. We both found the cloud forest to be a very interesting twist on a traditional greenhouse and worth visiting especially due to the bundled price!- @wanderingwithustwo,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1b/51/37/ec/wanderingwithustwo.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d4400781-r753471269-Cloud_Forest-Singapore.html

Old people can also cross using a wheelchair because it is very long. It is full of cold breezes so I am telling you to wear a shawl or a light sweater or a light jacket.

Cloud Forest,Jon K,Quite cool - literally and figuratively,50,8-Mar-20,"In the midst of the heat, in the middle of the Corona Virus Scare we decided to spend a Saturday at the Cloud Forest. Or in the Cloud Forest. First of all, bring a real shirt, or a light sweater or jacket because the temperature is quite a bit lower than outside. The Cloud Forest is a variation on the greenhouse theme and in this case it's a very expensive and very interesting one. A little too much oriented towards school trips when it comes to global warming et al but well done and, of course, important. But the whole highly expensive making of an artificial cloud forest is quite something to see. Worth it - and a great way to escape the heat. Normally I get the feeling that this is quite crowded, but with the virus scare it was lightly attended. I think it fair to say that people from 4 years old and up will get quite a kick out of it.

Looking up,way way up, at the water cascading gently down, enveloped by the sights and sounds of the semi- self-contained ecosystem, a thought made my eyes wet: Within this vast dome, the creators have boldly created into real life what the Hollywood makers Wakanda in Black Panther could only make us dream of. It is an inspirational wonder of the world. And it comes, unexpectedly, with an effective educational warning. Near the very end, all visitors are led out of the airy light through a darkened chamber. A dramatic hard hitting summary the state of the planet's threatened ecosystem outside the bubble is laid out in unambiguous terms.

You got to take the lift up to 6 and climb the rest of the way via staircase.Best part to me is the suspended walkway where you could look over and best floor is the cavern which is at one of the lower floors.This whole experience could have been improved if the waterfall is seen at the end of the trip, with the sound for the waterfall acting as a very powerful tease the entire time you are inside.Bestest experience here is the air conditioned which is a welcoming oasis after wandering around the outdoor displays at Gardens by the Bay.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1c/c4/8b/75/kyheng.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d4400781-r747030128-Cloud_Forest-Singapore.html

Cloud Forest,KylieIsTravelling,Crowded and queues,40,4-Jan-20,"I've visited Cloud Forest before on my first visit to Singapore and decided to visit it again. I'm glad I did, but I won't be back. Why? Once is enough to see it.There was a long queue to get into the Cloud Forest, and then once you got inside there was another really long queue to get to the lift to take you to the top of the Cloud Forest. I would have happily taken stairs instead of waiting for over 30 minutes inside the Cloud Forest to get the lift to the top, but they ushered you into the queue and there was no option to walk up.There was little to no crowd control / queue management either - lots of people cutting queues and no-one in site to manage the queues.This time, I was in and out pretty quickly, mainly as I'd seen it before and I'd visited the Botanic Gardens the day before where there was so much more to see - and it's free at the Botanic Gardens. Even Mount Faber was nice.The Cloud Forest is a bucket list item for most people visiting Singapore and I do recommend visiting. Then visit the Botanic Gardens for comparison.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/ff/28/4b/kylieistravelling.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d4400781-r732172974-Cloud_Forest-Singapore.html

This dome is located a bit of distance from the super grove at garden by the bay. This place requires a quite a lot of walking and also could be crowded during its peek hours. Hence is advisable to arrive early and if you could pre book your tickets itl be more convenient as well.The view of the cloud forest is simply amazing.

The cloud forest has lovely plants and a huge waterfall that you can look around and overall it is a nice way to spend around 1/1.5 hours. The best bit for us was the information and videos at the end about climate change. It's very cool inside and for the first time since arriving in Singapore I felt a bit chilly by the time we left. If you want to get out of the heat it's a perfect stop.

Cloud Forest,John G,Good attempt to replicate a cloud forest,40,13-Oct-19,"Getting in here can be a relief from the intense heat of Singapore, you may even feel chilled. The ""cloud forest"" is set in a dome, with an artificial mountain and the ""world's second highest indoor waterfall"", which greets you as you enter the dome. On the ground floor level, there is an interesting collection of plants, particularly thee orchids, some of which are in plastic containers so that you can appreciate their scents. You then have to enter a lift, in order to get to the top of the 'mountain'. There is a good show of epiphytes on the mountain and even some birds to feed on the nectar. In reality, it is not at all like being in a cloud forest, which tends to be much wetter, in my experience. However, as an educational tool, I think it is excellent.

Cloud Forest,Littleshiv,A dreamy wonderland,40,6-Oct-19,Cloud forest is at Marina Bay and I spent a day here just enjoying the atmosphere. The cloud forest itself can probably be enjoyed in about an hour - it gets busy so try to choose a quieter time so you can relax and enjoy The tranquillity.

Cloud Forest,KYHENG,30 meters tall man made waterfall,40,14-Mar-21,"This to me is the highlight of the exhibits here and could have been arranged such that it is the last to see. Still it is great to have it at the entrance.Within the dome, the exhibits are arranged by floors, starting at level 7. You got to take the lift up to 6 and climb the rest of the way via staircase.Best part to me is the suspended walkway where you could look over and best floor is the cavern which is at one of the lower floors.This whole experience could have been improved if the waterfall is seen at the end of the trip, with the sound for the waterfall acting as a very powerful tease the entire time you are inside.Bestest experience here is the air conditioned which is a welcoming oasis after wandering around the outdoor displays at Gardens by the Bay.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1c/c4/8b/75/kyheng.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d4400781-r687172961-Cloud_Forest-Singapore.html

As soon as you walk in the sight greets you, as well as the hundreds of tourists gathering at the bottom for a photograph. Having had a relatively quiet morning we found the next leg of our day extremely busy. I made the mistake of wearing a maxi dress to the gardens and had people constantly standing on my dress.In the cloud forest you follow a walkway that snakes around a plant clad mountain. This does streamline the crowds but there were no points where it was too overwhelming. Despite the hot and humid weather outside the conservatory was very cool to walk around and a welcome respite.

Cloud Forest,Grover R,The Most Amazing Garden Exhibit in the World,50,1-Feb-21,"It is amazingly difficult to put in to words this attraction. It is a MUST SEE if you go to Singapore and for me it was the best and most amazing part of Gardens by the Bay. I have been to all kinds of gardens, including enclosed ones. Most of the time it is to keep the plants warm enough, here it is to keep them cool enough. There is simply nothing like it in the world.You walk in and are greeted by an incredible green waterfall and then you walk around this verdant mountain of various plants. Every turn is unbelievable. There are full grown trees and incredible views through the glass enclosure and this is before the main attraction when you ride the elevator 7 stories to the top of the mountain to begin a leisurely walk down. Again the views and the plants are amazing. The pictures will show you but they dont do it justice.
