Jewel Changi Airport,yueqiaosm,Fantasic,50,13-Feb-21,"Extremely beautiful and seems to come into a fairyland.

Jewel Changi Airport,wesleywaisiu,Best mall in Singapore,50,30-Dec-20,"Jewel is the best shopping mall for an airport around the world, as people said. It is also the best shopping mall in Singapore in my opinion.Firstly, the world biggest waterfall and the Show has already attracted all the eyeballs. The train that run through the building is awesome, although it's closed now.You can find all kinds of shops there. The restaurant choices are one of the most in the area, with all kinds of cuisine, from cheap to expensive. Cinema, hotel, indoor playground, supermarkets, Changi experience, a lot of parking space, it has all the things you need.The only drawback is the crowd, sometimes the 1000+ parking space will be all full, and hard to find a seat even with so many restaurants. And it's quite far to walk to T2 or T3 for the MRT station.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/b2/default-avatar-2020-69.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d17237163-r780214907-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html
Jewel Changi Airport,LUVBALIBEACH,A Great Alternative Mall to shop and dine till you drop and add on calories.,50,23-Dec-20,"We stayed at airport hotel cos we wanted to visit Jewel.It was a good choice to stay a night so no rush to see everything here.We came earlier before hotel's check in at 3pm. We had lunch at shake shack.Then started shopping immediately. There were 5 floors in all plus 2 basements.Shops are concentrated on 1 to 4, 5th is more entertainment, bars and food outlets. Level 4 mostly for kids shopping.B1 B2 food restaurants and some retail shops too.We shop at Desigual, Muji, Footlocker, ShirtBar, Zara, Marks and Spencer, etc.There were some designer shops like Moschino, Furla, Katespade, etc but since we can get these in towns, we look for unique shops. DESIGUAL has limited edition items only at Jewel when items are first launched. By the time items move to the town stores, items could be sold out.The shops are lined up in a circle so just walk and you end up at the starting point again. There are some restaurants or food shops in some of the levels so you can still dine then shop again on same level.We tried JW360 for dinner, Shake Shack for lunch, Paris Baquette for Tea Time and had ice cream at birds of paradise. Now, you see where the calories go?We just stroll floor by floor so easy to complete and not miss any shop.At level 5 we pay to visit the evening christmas garden so we can take some great photos. There is even a camp site on this level where you can rent a tent just for fun. We had already booked a hotel.The best part in Jewel is of course, the atrium with waterfall. At 630pm, there is the train going around the waterfall, snow flakes flying plus smoke effect. Just good photo session. Then 730pm, they have the light and music show. The sound of the water crashing down, colour changing plus music make this, a spectacular event!There is even a SHAW movie theatre so if visitors had a short stopover, they could watch a movie here.We love this place cos there is so much to see and do. Or even if you just want to waste time here, it can also help you to destress.There should be an airport shuttle just to bring people from town to here in a swift. That is, express airport shuttle.Overall, fantastic place to visit cos no tourists and thus not overly crowded.A good escape if time permits.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/4e/24/bc/luvbalibeach.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d17237163-r779770288-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html

Jewel Changi Airport,ZahidahTifny,Kudos to Mr Abdul!,50,10-Dec-20,"We were walking around at approx 9.30am at Jewel to find places to eat. As we were searching at the directory, the Jewel staff approached us and informed us that most of the eateries will open approximately at 10.30am. Those that were already open are non-halal options.He gave many suggestions on where to go and what to eat and assured us that we will enjoy our visit here.Thank you for being proactive and going out of the way to speak to us while on his cleaning duty.

Jewel Changi Airport,Curious265314,Really impressive,50,15-Oct-20,Really beautiful airport. The waterfall portion isn't exactly inside the airport but they make it pretty accessible for travelers to visit. If you're only doing a quick layover at the airport and want to see the waterfall you can take the tram that drives by it. We came to the airport early just to check it out. You can even check your bags in there so you can walk around..just make sure you leave enough time to do all of it and get to your gate on time.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1c/2c/bf/4b/curious265314.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d17237163-r774329421-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html

It has the largest indoor waterfall, and it's very fun to get views of it from the four or five different levels, all the way at the base, to almost at the very top.

Jewel Changi Airport,WanderingWithUsTwo,Best place for a flight delay,50,13-May-20,We chose to have a long layover in Singapore (15hrs) to be able to explore it for a day. This adventure started at the airport which we could have stayed in for the entire 15 hours without getting bored. They have many unique free things to do and see while you wait in the airport including a butterfly garden! This particular airport has been rated top in the world for the past 6 years and has definitely earned that title. The Jewel is the latest in their attractions and now holds the world record for the largest indoor waterfall. Hidden near the arrival hall of terminal 1 this is worth stopping by. This end of the airport includes a high end shopping mall with many international stores which hide the waterfall while adding more mystique to the attraction. There are many levels of stairs and walkways surrounding the jewel to allow you to get different perspectives of it and the iconic selfie by it. While we were there they had signs displayed that mentioned new additions to the Jewel experience this year which include a canopy bridge. This entire area of the airport will be adding over 10 new attractions estimated by the end of this year (2019). We highly advise stopping by even for a small layover to at least witness the airport for yourself. Keep in mind if you have a layover for over 5 hours the airport also offers free tour bus rides of Singapore as well!- @wanderingwithustwo,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1b/51/37/ec/wanderingwithustwo.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d17237163-r753471698-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html

Jewel Changi Airport,Tony P,A reflection of how amazing Singapore is,50,14-Mar-20,Staying in Crowne Plaza so exploring here was essential.

Jewel Changi Airport,merseyblue-1,Well worth a visit!,50,7-Mar-20,"Who would ever says they are impressed with airports? They basically serve a purpose. Some are good and some are not but Singapore Airport is a whole new level. The airport has to be one of the most organised and cleanest places we've travelled to. We stayed for one night at Crowne Plaza.The Jewel is land-side between terminals 2 and 3 and is very aptly named. It tends to be restaurants, coffee lounges and so on. There are several bars on the top level. There are some tourist attractions to visit and if you are passing through Singapore, I'd suggest you take time out to include this place. I would not say that about any other airport we've been through! Many airlines have a bag drop so you can get rid of your suitcase early and relax before you go air-side through security for your flight. Even air-side there is plenty to do and see.The world's biggest waterfall is impressive and in the evening from 7.30pm they do light shows with music.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/86/0e/a3/merseyblue-1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d17237163-r749637424-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html

Jewel Changi Airport,robert3cathome,Stunning & Unbelievable,50,6-Mar-20,We had a chance to fly through the Singapore Changi airport. The Jewel at Terminal 1 is something that cannot be missed. The waterfall is a sight to behold. Take the escalators to the top floor and there are bars and restaurants overlooking the waterfall and gardens. At each level in between are more restaurants and shopping. You will think you are in a high-end mall and not an airport terminal.

It is opened in April 2019 to welcome 300,000 visitors per day, so far we heard that over 50 millions have visited it.

Jewel Changi Airport,Ellie1145,Astonishing,50,28-Feb-20,"We flew from Changi to Sydney and were eager to visit the recently opened Jewel.We checked in for our flight then followed the signs, which are clearly displayed, to this amazing feature.It was very crowded, and we didn't want to miss our flight so we weren't able to spend as long as we would have liked, but it certainly takes your breath away. The lifts were very slow and jam packed so that made it harder to see everything. I gave up and walked down instead.This wonderful attraction is linked to three of its passenger terminals, and was quite a walk for us from check in.Built in a huge glass dome, the centrepiece is the astonishing Rain Vortex, the tallest indoor waterfall in the world. It's surrounded by lush vegetation and terraces where you can sit and gaze at it in all its glory.The site covers over 8 acres and has 12 storeys, 7 of which are at basement level.The glass and steel facade was actually designed by the same architects who designed the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, with its iconic ship perched on the top of the building.The Shiseido Forest Valley is one of Asia's largest indoor gardens. It covers around 22,000 square metres and spans 5 stories. It's extraordinary to think that there are around 3,000 trees and 60,000 shrubs from all around the world.But it's piece de resistance has to be the astonishing Rain Vortex waterfall which dominates the centre of the garden, and stands 130 ft high. It cascades down from a round hole in the glass ceiling and an incredible 38,000 litres of recirculating rain water is pumped through the hole every minute. Below it is a huge basement level pool.The glass roof, which is toroid shaped, is made up of over 9,000 pieces of glass. At night it becomes the 360 degree backdrop for a light and sound show, which sadly we could not stay for.It's a truly astonishing piece of engineering and design, and it is incredible to think that it is inside an airport.We just didn't have time to visit the canopy park, which is about $5 to enter, or the canopy mazes, but I was able to walk down to the bottom of the waterfall and stand and gaze in awe at its beauty.It seems odd to want to spend more time in an airport, but there is still so much to see here in Jewel that I hope one day to return.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/19/5e/9f/71/ellie1145.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d17237163-r748010882-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html

Jewel Changi Airport,KylieIsTravelling,Airport departure visit,40,4-Jan-20,"I visited Jewel on my way home from Singapore and got to the airport especially to check out Jewel.There's a lot to see here - apart from the Rain Vortex, there are activities available on level 5 / the top floor which unfortunately you have to pay for (I didn't this time), there's a hotel where you can book a room for a few hours to dump your bags, have a snooze and refresh, and there is a massive amount of shops and eateries here - so much choice.Due to it being Christmas time whenI visited, they had a Christmas market section on level 5.Concierge staff are very helpful and there are plenty of signs available to navigate your way around Jewel. There's also plenty of lifts for people with strollers or in wheelchairs, and the bathrooms are delightfully decorated.Well worth visiting if you have the time to spare when arriving or departing the airport.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/ff/28/4b/kylieistravelling.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d17237163-r736694283-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html
Jewel Changi Airport,Ims92100,Worth the experience but please don't have people pay for access to the rain vortex!,40,4-Jan-20,"We are regular visitors of Jewel as this is a nice option to entertain before taking flights, especially at night. We really enjoy the canopy and our kids love to do the bouncing over there.The rain vortex is the main attraction, and remains always impressive to see.What a surprise to discover that for Christmas, the rain vortex was closed on L1 and L2 ! They ask you to get a receipt with 50 SGD spending to get a view of what has always been in free access until now... Even if you would abide by the rule, this is almost impossible as we use Jewel only a few hours before flying and don't have time to get to restaurant, get the right receipt, have it redeemed and then enter what should be a normal area of the mall. This is a very sad evolution of Jewel. Doesn't make good publicity to Shiseido to have their name associated to such a discrimative endeaviour. I understand we have to pay for canopy which is an attraction. I dont understand why we should be prevented to wander in a mall.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d17237163-r736656005-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html

Jewel Changi Airport,wuibin,Interesting & Unique,40,26-Dec-19,"Its not just another shopping mall. Its a place where you can visit attractions, experience and do different activities.

Absolutely huge from the outside and stunning inside with an abundance of shops and restaurants. Unfortunately most tended to be on the very expensive end of the scale but nevertheless well worth a visit to see the stunning decorations and displays. The cascading waterfall was quite breathtaking and as day gave way to nightfall and the many coloured lights reflected of the water, it became quite magical.Due to the very large crowd in attendance, photo opportunities were rather limited but that aside, well worth a visit.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d17237163-r733858416-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html
Jewel Changi Airport,QldKaren,Transit has never been so much fun!,40,17-Dec-19,"Changi airport has so much to see and do. It's the perfect airport to while away the hours whilst transitting between flights.Our family of 4 had a 6 hour transit at Changi en route from Australia to London. We arrived into Changi's terminal 1 at about 630pm. We could have easily spent time wandering around the many shops in the airport terminal but instead we took our cabin bags with us, quickly and easily cleared immigration and walked directly from terminal 1 into the new adjoining Jewel complex. The Jewel is housed in a glass dome and is a massive retail shopping mall that also has a few attractions.The main attraction is the indoor garden and rain vortex. We visited in December and in order for 2 people to gain access to the ground level of the indoor garden we had to spend 50 SGD in the Jewel complex. There was no other way to enter. I am not sure if this was because the indoor garden was lit up for Christmas, or because there was a special Christmas dance show on, plus regular (very short) light shows, or whether spending money in the Jewel is the only way to gain access to the garden year round. In any event, it was great to see the rain vortex up close.We then made our way to level 5, which can only be accessed from lift foyers C and E. There are many bars and restaurants on this top floor of the complex, and it is also home to the canopy park and its attractions.The canopy park seemed to be endless and it was lovely to wander around it. There are a number of ticketed attractions inside the canopy park. My family enjoyed the canopy nets (there are walking and jumping options - we chose the walking nets because the jumping ones were booked out for the rest of the evening). There was also a hedge maze and a mirror maze, which we resolved to check out next time we transit through Singapore.Some things to note:- Children under the age of 13 were not permitted to go onto any of the canopy park attractions by themselves and had to be supervised by an adult (thus requiring an adult ticket to the attraction to be purchased in addition to the children's tickets). In our case, the other adult stayed with all the cabin bags!- Entry to any of the canopy park attractions includes entry to the canopy park itself. Given one of our adults was staying with the bags and not going on the canopy nets, we were able to purchase 'canopy park only admission'ù for 5 SGD for that person to allow them to enter the park.- Canopy park admission includes a small number of attractions - the foggy pools (perfect for toddlers), the topiary walk, petal garden and discovery slide.- The attractions closed at 10pm the night we were there.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d17237163-r733195548-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html

I have no idea how tall it is but I suppose it's all available if you ""Google it"".We wandered around for hours. Yes there is so much to see and it's well laid out plus it gave us the opportunity to have a ""Western"" lunch. To tell the truth I was craving a milk shake and when we stumbled upon a Shake Shack where we indulged in a Hot Dog, Hamburger, Fries and a Strawberry Shake. Just the type of meal you don't usually have in S.E Asia.The only negative I could think of about the Jewel is that there are many places to go or things to see that you have to pay for the privilege of taking part in.

Jewel Changi Airport,BT993TT,Another big shopping mall ......,30,14-Dec-19,"Managed to pay a visit to Jewel following an inbound flight arrival at Terminal 1. A new, nice and big shopping mall! Just not my thing so ..... Visited and tried their food hall (food court) in Basement 2 called Five Spices. There is a good variety of stalls and we tried 3 of them. They are Saravanaa Bhavan ($7.50), Nasi Ayam Taman Serasi ($5.50) and Guan's Mee Pok ($6.50). Of course prices are dependent on what you order. You can refer to my photos. All served decent quality food but as expected, it is rather pricey and not a lot of food ..... understandably so given the venue location. It is not a very large food hall so the number of tables are somewhat limited. I would recommend that you transit over to the food hall in the Basement of Terminal 3. Much better if you are looking for a more ""local"" feel and larger variety and more places to sit. But if you are looking to kill time and to window shop or shop then this is it at the airport.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d17237163-r732508036-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html

Jewel Changi Airport,Kate4710,You need to leave airport to properly enjoy the Jewel,30,28-Oct-19,"From the international airport, you can catch a train that takes you from one terminal to another with the track going above the Jewel canopy and passing the waterfall. And that's it...To properly enjoy this attraction you need to clear immigration (which is possible when in transit if you have long enough) first. The large shopping centre surrounding the Jewel is quite quiet - it hasn't really taken off yet. It was nice to wander around looking at the waterfall - make sure you go to the base - one or two levels down. The shopping centre surrounds the Jewel in a circle so you need to go up levels in the shopping centre to see it all form different angles. I didn't find it clearly signposted where to find each entry on the different levels so spent more time than I had available walking in circles trying to find the entrances.

Jewel Changi Airport,William C,"Jewel ""outside of"" Changi Airport",30,8-Oct-19,"Despite the words ""Changi Airport"" behind the name of this property, it will take you a while to walk there. The impression that I got from the advertisement of this place made me think that it was an expansion of the airport building itself, which is not the case apparently. It was another different building with some walking distance from the airport, which could be the reason why it is promoted quite heavily with so many signs scattering around. They actually put the signs directing you to this place like literally on every corner of the airport; for departure, from the moment you get off the train you can see one of them, or for arrival, as soon as you claim your luggage, thus creating false impression that it's near. After walking for quite a while only you will find a redundant sign ""2 mins walk"" when you can already clearly see the entrance is right in front of you. Along the way I could hear some tourists concerned about the same distance going back to the airport, either for their flights or for train leaving the airport.One of its main attractions is the first permanent (hopefully) Pok√©mon Center outside of Japan so for arriving tourists with kids who plan to visit there, please let your kids know beforehand about the walking distance.Also, like some have stated before, it is just another shopping mall. If you are waiting for your flight and have nothing you would like to find particularly at Jewel, it's more convenient to just chill and dine inside the Changi Airport building itself.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/14/fa/93/7d/william-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d17237163-r716227805-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html
Jewel Changi Airport,soundsverygood,"Pretty waterfall, just an average mall",30,30-Sep-19,We had some time between flights and thought we would go and see the new thing. We found out that meant that we had to clear immigration and fill in those ridiculous forms - who though red was a good idea for a form with small writing?After a Skytrain ride and walk and some elevators we found the place. The waterfall is pretty cool and worth taking shots of. We were really hungry so we looked for something to eat. And looked. We finally found a food court with 'local' food hiding behind an area of fast food places with stand up eating.The foodcourt looked like it had been there for years. Cramped seating areas - perhaps all the space was used up with the waterfall. The food was average.Finally sated we wander some of the mall - but it's just the same old same old.Been. Tick. Return?

Jewel Changi Airport,Kaz41,Interesting to visit,30,27-Sep-19,We visited Jewel before our flight. It was very handy to be able to check in early for Singapore Airlines at Jewel so that we didn't have any luggage with us. The gardens are beautiful and the waterfall is amazing.

There is another place where one has to just be prepared to empty the wallets with all types of entrance fees giving a feeling of a big let down in such a doom structure.

Jewel Changi Airport,John_C_Senior,Singapore on steroids,30,13-Aug-19,"We had a long layover at Changi airport and went to visit the Jewel. This is very convenient and easy to do. Simply go through immigration/arrivals and it's a short walk to the Jewel which is a new multi-storey shopping mall.From an engineering and architectural perspective the Jewel is very innovative and interesting. The central feature is a large, cascading rain vortex/waterfall and lots and lots of green plants.That said, it is really just a shopping mall and another place for Singaporeans to do what they do - shop, eat, shop ...It was very crowded and somewhat frenetic when I visited. I thought that it might be a nice place to relax for a few hours between flights but I actually found the airport more relaxing.

While the website advertises that Jewel is open 24 hours, we arrived at 3:00am (our international flight was at 6:00am) all all of the shops but a few restaurants were closed, the waterfall was not operating, and all of the lights in the rainforest and attraction area were off. Additionally, the early check in counter and luggage hold areas were closed as well, so we had to walk about with all of our baggage. There was something nice about being in Jewel and the airport at such an odd hour as it was empty and quiet, but it made for a disappointing Jewel visit. We were really hoping to view the waterfall in all of its glory but were unable to do so. We are certain that Jewel has a very different vibe when it is open with all of the shops, restaurants, and and attractions open and running.

Jewel Changi Airport,groovyguitar,Clean lots of facilities but soulless and thoughtless,30,12-Jul-19,"As everyone seems to believe and know, Changi is a great showpiece airport. It's got all on would wish for in an airport...except soul and thoughtfulness for the traveller. So you can get into the airport and check in your bags with clever self check machines and even cleverer self bag drop areas in Terminal 1. You can then walk across to the largest indoor waterfall, that much promoted feature that is quite beautiful when you see each floor level of the concept.Then try to see the Butterfly park and see how long it takes to get an answer from any of the airport staff as to how you get to that feature. One said go to Level 3 and walk across to terminal 3, another said you cannot get to Level 3 by lift but by elevator ....when we finally got there, another said go through security and you get to the Butterfly Park. Security , despite seeing the boarding pass and scanning for validity, said we needed to go back to Terminal 1 and go through security there and then go back to Terminal 3. When all this was done, there was no time left to see the Butterfly Park so exhausted and annoyed at the utter lack of any coherent ability of the airport or staff to offer simple instructions, we made our way to the boarding gate picking up food and drink along the way. At the boarding gate, we were told drink even bought at the airport, cannot go through the at-gate security check to be taken into the plane so we had to throw away or drink.Are there any signs anywhere that this very peculiar practice applies to Changi....NO NO NO.The airport is made for a concept of high tech efficiency but not effective wuth passengers in mind.

It was a long walk from the terminal and its easy to lose track of time, so be sure to factor that in if you are going prior to a flight. We were disappointed as we arrived about 745am and nothing was open. The water wasn't flowing in the waterfall either. There were lots of people just wandering around what is essentially a massive shopping centre with a really big indoor waterfall in the middle of it, and lots of plants. At 8:00am the waterfall started to flow and it was pretty cool. Kids absolutely love it. There are lots of restaurants and there are some climbing activities on the upper level that looked fun (but were not open).

You see, Singapore needs more shopping malls like an oil millionaire needs more Ferraris; once you reach a certain level of redundancy then adding another seems like a waste of space. Oh sure, it has a fancy fountain in the middle that looks like a giant's sphincter but after 11 hours in a plane it's hard to be impressed by yet another mall with a water feature.

Early check-in for select airlines (CHECK BEFORE GOING)And the bad (why it is only getting 3 stars):1. Scraping the barrel with brands. When Shake Shack has the pole position in a brand new $1.7b mall and is rubbing shoulders on that same level with Tokyu Hands and Muji, makes me worry...2. Drop off has NO ACCESS TO EARLY CHECK IN!!! Beware. If you are thinking that this is a HK IFC style set-up, you will be sadly mistaken. The Jewel drop off is located a level above the early check-in, there are NO CARTS provided and the carts (even if there were any) are not allowed in the mall to go down to the early check-in. Horrible design and just a shame since they were so close to getting it right... How are you supposed to use the early check in if you can't even get to it???3. Hotel: The Yotel is a joke. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!

The rain vortex is indeed impressive and completely changes from day to night and from the top to the bottom levels and the forest around it is nice too.In my opinion they could turn down the hideous 'movie soundtrack' music, get rid of the loud percussion band and dull cartoons and try to make it a little more natural and interesting - but I guess that might distract people from spending money......Massive queues for most food and beverage outlets (at least on Sunday)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/06/45/4e/10/viaben.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d17237163-r674248101-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html

Its true that Jewel does have a few more international brands that you may not get in other malls, but the price is higher.Understand most photo focus on the water fountain, but it is very similar to the one at MBS only bigger. The place was very crowded, and most facilities are yet to open during the preview. Most restaurants are not ready for the crowd yet, so ordering food does take awhile.If you happens to drop by Singapore do go and have a look, it may worth to check in for you social media and a few photos.

Jewel Changi Airport,Inokashirakichijoji,Waste of time 'ì rude staff 'ì Jewel Changi Airport,10,4-Jan-20,"I had a 12 hour stopover in Singapore and wanted to fill in time until 1am. I planned the day to make the most of my time in Singapore. I have been many times, but never bothered to visit the 'Jewel Changi Airport'ù. On the recommendation of a Singaporean friend, I decided to include the 'Jewel Changi Airport'ù in my stopover.I had a quick look at the ground floor of 'Jewel Changi Airport'ù after arriving into Singapore. It seemed ok, and I thought I could spend an hour or 2 before boarding my early morning flight. So I first went into the city and then went back to Changi Airport to spend some time in the 'Jewel Changi Airport'ù.On arrival I noticed that the entrance to the ground floor of 'Jewel Changi Airport'ù that I used during the day was now blocked with a sign and a staff member preventing entry to the ground floor of the 'Jewel Changi Airport'ù. I then went to the main entrance. The staff advised I needed to spend $50 in a single transaction in a shop within the 'Jewel Changi Airport'ù shopping mall. They called the ground floor the 'Shiseido Forest Valley'ù. I told the staff that had I know this earlier in the day I would have kept my receipts and now most of the shops were closed, so how can I spend $50. I already had dinner and didn't need to eat again just to spend $50. I asked the staff how else can I get entry and the staff said 'just like everyone else, get a receipt'ù. The staff was rude and lacked customer service. The 'Jewel Changi Airport'ù concierge was already closed, so I could not discuss this with them. There were not many people inside the 'Shiseido Forest Valley'ù, so I don't understand why they couldn't just let me inside. I thought the 'Jewel Changi Airport'ù was meant to attract tourist, instead it appears to not want them to enter. If a local family with 5 kids arrives, they can easily spend $50 on food and beverage to gain entry, but tourists don't always have the need to spend $50, particularly if the shops are closed.I discussed this with the staff in Changi Airport's information desk, who advised the 'Jewel Changi Airport'ù is separate from the airport and not the same company. I told them I researched the different options and things to do in 'Jewel Changi Airport'ù and didn't see the special event/conditions of entry to the ground floor. They showed me where this information was on the internet and agreed it is very confusing as the same ground floor area is named differently for different events such as 'sparkling wonders of Christmas'ù. This makes it difficult for some tourists to get a good understanding of the special event conditions of entry.I went to each of the levels in this mall, to view the closed shops. It was like a ghost town. The top level had a few bars but very few customers. This mall claims to be 24 hours on the internet but it is not. Most facilities close early. Waste of time.I was very disappointed with the 'Jewel Changi Airport'ù and will never return. Next time I transit through Singapore I will go to Tampines shopping centre which is very close to the airport or Mustafa Centre which is 24 hours. The Gardens by the Bay is also a good option which is open till late.So I spent my final hours in Singapore in the Changi Airport departure terminal which does not have enough seating for travellers, so many travellers sit on the floor. Not a nice way to end a holiday.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/13/f8/f5/55/inokashirakichijoji.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d17237163-r736751271-Jewel_Changi_Airport-Singapore.html
Jewel Changi Airport,HungryMao,Terribly noisy and overcrowded,10,27-Dec-19,"I heard so much about Jewel and it did seem like an interesting place to visit.The place was really overcrowded and it was just very very noisy. Thankfully I had my noise cancelling earphones with me and kept plugged in during my visit.Some shops were cramped and were split over 2 floors, they're accessible by stairs, not the most convenient for my 75 year old mom, but they might have been targeting the younger crowd with more disposable income in this case.It's just like any overcrowded new mall in this case, which was unfortunate.
