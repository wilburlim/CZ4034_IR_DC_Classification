Singapore Flyer,ahhjojo,Flyers Dinner,50,12-Mar-21,"Great experience and value for money considering the great view, good food and excellent services provided!Only downside is the time, 2 rounds of flyers is an hour for 4 course meal. 2 course per round, 1st round was sufficient but second round is a bit too tight for the main course and dessert. Not everyone eats that fast though and ended up rushing through the meal.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r784385649-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

But the view still takes my breath away.Seriously speaking, if you are visiting Singapore, please2x make sure you take this ride as well. The highest point at 165m, you get to see our city area and residential areas.It is a breathtaking 30minute ride.

Singapore Flyer,AsiaMorgan,A great time for a whirl,50,19-Oct-20,"After living in Singapore for several years and doing most tourist attractions two to three or more time, my ten-year-old daughter and I finally tried the Singapore Flyer. Well, it's just blissful at the moment - a bit sad but blissful. The pandemic has reduced crowds significantly at such tourist attractions so while I wish them better times ahead, but for now I enjoy the tranquility they offer. This is your usual slow moving mega Ferris wheel but wow, the views and the opportunity to experience an entire 'pod' with just your family. Memorable and a real treat. We loved it - just wished they would have let us go around twice.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/a6/68/4d/asiamorgan.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r774881770-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

Singapore Flyer,Dawn S,LOVE IT,50,31-Jan-20,I have been lucky enough to visit a few Flyers in the World and the Singapore one is magnificent and the best I have ever been on - go in the evening when it is getting dark as the views of the city are amazing and the Marina Bay Sands and Gardens are next door so you can see these all lit up. This is by far better than the London Eye which is world famous and you have a lot of room to walk around and take photos. I am not a great lover of heights but this did not bother me at all. As is everything in Singapore this attraction is very well organised and you have little time to wait. There is a visitors centre nearby with local food and drinks for visitors to try out before or after.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0e/c8/d5/74/dawn-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r742141527-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

Singapore Flyer,Keone K,Couples vacation,50,19-Jan-20,The Lion was interesting and a lot bigger than it looked when you get up close.

Singapore Flyer,AdaMF3535,Champagne version worth the $$,50,14-Jan-20,"Although we had our doubts about the VIP edition for the Singapore Flyer, we enjoyed the experience hugely. There was very little waiting to board the big wheel, and the champagne not only eased any anxiety over the height and duration, but also heightened the exhilaration over the sights. It was also nice to be able to sit down whenever we wanted and to have more space to move about. Our group of four shared a capsule with only a group of two (with a bottle of good champagne for each group). Visitors should schedule their visit for sunset if possible.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0f/67/ac/d8/ada-m-f.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r739013291-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html
Singapore Flyer,Jim K,Awesome view of the city,50,13-Jan-20,What an experience! Worth the time and money spent. You get to see the whole city. Felt safe at all times.

Singapore Flyer,577adac,Nice scenery,50,11-Jan-20,Visited the Singapore flyer a few times because it is always beautiful to view the scenery from the flyer.

Singapore Flyer,davelin_singapore,Great Experience!,50,8-Jan-20,"My friend from the US stayed in the Hotel Ritz Carlton which is very close to the spot. The cabin is very spacious and feel comfortable! You can see the 360 degree full view of the bay area which is amazing! Great experience for travelers even for me as a local Singapore! The ticket is worth the price. When I go, not many people maybe it is weekdays. Waiting time is just few minutes. It was afternoon time and the sunshine was a bit strong. Maybe the evening time would be even better with nicer view. Staff is friendly and direction is very clear. The staff was very kind and willing to hold camera and take photos for us. Great training and service attitude. The place is kids friendly if you kids are ok with the height. Will come again with my guests from other country!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/89/60/15/davelin-singapore.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r737699191-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html
Singapore Flyer,Rads88,Quiet and peaceful with stunning views of Singapore,50,6-Jan-20,"We've lived in Singapore for over 7 years now but we visited the flyer only in 2019 when guests came. Though we already know what an architectural marvel Singapore is, the panoramic views from the flyer make this ride worth it. We timed it to go up at twilight and come down after dark. It is quiet and peaceful as compared to views from other places and Singapore looks stunning in the night lights.My only wish is that it was a tad longer at 45 minutes.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r737176330-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

It helps to be friendly with strangers so that you can take pictures of each other.The ride is pretty slow and lasts for about 30 minutes.

Singapore Flyer,brodolli83,I loved the entire experience,50,12-Dec-19,The ride takes about 25 to 30 minutes. It's like riding an elevator with floor to ceiling glass. It's an enclosed capsule and it's air conditioned. It's the highest of its kind around the world and it gives great views of practically the entire country and even Malaysia. What I particularly like about it is that there's an audio commentary that you can choose to use during the ride. It narrates about the different places in Singapore and even gives trivia about these places that I was surprised to hear about.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r732072225-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

Also there were only 8 people in the capsule so plenty of room to see the great view of Marina Bay.The ride lasted about half an hour and moves so slowly you can't tell you're moving.I'm not very good with heights so the first part of the ride going up was quite nerve racking but I enjoyed the second half of the ride more and the view is better on this side of the flyer.The most annoying part of the ride is the constant commentary and screen telling you about Singapore. It doesn't correlate with the ride so is pretty pointless really.Otherwise it's a great experience and not too expensive.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/19/65/27/02/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r715300082-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

No, it's not cheap but it's not bad value as the flyer moves very slowly although I can't remember how long we were on for - certainly long enough to get lots of photos.

The 360 views of Singapore are breathtaking. The tube you travel in on the Ferris wheel has air conditioning. Great selfie and scenery picture taking moments.The only reason this attraction was not 5 stars is the very long walk and confusing entrance to the ride. This could be better signed and a more direct way could be helpful when it is so blazing hot outside.Otherwise, the sights and ride are worth the price of admission.

Luckily the lines were fast moving and we didn't have to wait long.

I got some great photos (when I could let go of the bench) but I don't think it was a significantly better view than from the top of MBS.

If you can get a sweet bargain, go ahead, but it's a long walk from public transport and usually a long wait in line, and its a 45 minute ride. I don't regret doing it - but I wouldn't have regretted skipping it and saving the time/money either.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/16/7f/fb/f1/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r695310520-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

(2) We purchased a premium entry package with a Singapore Sling, and it was absolutely awful. Just disgustingly sweet cherry juice with no detectable alcohol.

Singapore Flyer,SusanPerth,Room for improvement,30,26-Apr-19,"I took a first-time visitor to the Singapore Flyer, confirming the actual experience of riding it is worthwhile. My experience of getting to the flyer, however, left me hot and annoyed and the disinterest of the young staff in my comments about the lack of signage didn't improve the situation. The website instructions say to travel to Promenade Station, take exit A and follow the blue signs for a 5 minute walk. I could not spot any signs and although the flyer is visible, a construction site blocks the view of which direction to access it from. On arrival we followed the sign to what we believed would be the ticket booth and entrance, only to find that the ticket booth was the floor below and the other side of the building to the flyer entrance. There seemed to be no logic in this location as it was neither near the carpark or foot traffic.

I ended up not being allowed on the Skywalk and to date Klook have been difficult to deal with and haven't accepted my email with childs ticket photo (claiming they can't open it, when I emailed it to my other email addresses and have no problems). When we were at the Skywalk someone else had the exact same thing happen from Klook as well.The Flyer was a nice slow ride and had great commentary about history and sights to look at.

Although it said the capsules hold 28 people, there were only around half a dozen in ours because it was a quiet time of day.But here's the issue. At $34 per adult, it's comparable with other high rise views around the world. But there's loads of competition. We preferred the One Altitude rooftop bar, for instance, which offered similar views - and at $35 came with two rounds of cocktails.

There were three of us and another Chinese family of 8. I will say only that the whole family were all loud, argumentative and aggressive when it came to seats and standing in front of people trying to look at the view. Not much you can do about it except enjoy yourself otherwise. And I did enjoy the view from the relative safety of my seat, even when we were going over the top of the ferris wheel so high in the sky with seemingly only a few metal spikes holding us up - what was I thinking!!!

This place is designed for people who go there by tour coaches.For those going from the MRT, it's a so-near-yet-so-far experience because of the bad signage. It gets worse when it is a hot day and you have kids in tow and you just wonder if you are going the wrong way. The escalator at the side of car park that leads to the overhead bridge to the Singapore Flyer building has no signs so I won't be surprised if many people end up jaywalking instead. And even if you use the overhead bridge, you will reach level 2, and then you realise that you have to walk a big round to reach the escalator that goes to level 1.There are no seating area at the taxi area, and also hardly any seats for anyone who wants to take a rest without buying a drink.

Singapore Flyer,PoolBarPlease,Hopeless staff unable to resolve a known ticketing issue,20,30-Nov-20,"A simply extraordinary display of zero empathy and zero responsibility of a known issue with their third party booking system.Bought two adults and a child from an approved third party. Received confirmation after payment some time ago, only to be told at the ticket checkin that because the third party hasn't sent the children's ticket (for whatever reason) - despite a receipt and email stating payment and ticket confirmation - staff refused to let us in. End of story. No solution. No assistance. Just 'no'ù. It was juvenile.We were there for my daughter's 5th birthday celebration who was wondering - literally in tears - why the staff were being nice to everyone else and letting them in except us. Even a child could see the horrendous handling of this by the undertrained and hopeless staff.One particularly terrible employee who we initially spoke to - before I asked her to walk away - was a demonstration in entitlement and childish arrogance. Her attitude was woeful and her immediate unwillingness to assist us in any way was bizarre at best. I believe her name was Farah and management should pop her in a back office as far away from customers as possible.The young male trainee - the only one with any sense of customer service who actually apologising for the issue we were facing - stated this has happened before and the previous customers tried the international number 'relentlessly'ù to try and resolve the issue when presented with the same doe-eyed stupidity. An issue which SHOULD have been acknowledged, addressed and resolved by the staff rather than providing us a clinic in short sightedness and idiocy.It took four staff - FOUR - before someone finally came down to attempt to resolve the issue - taking every detail of the purchase down to the point of ridiculous - when we we're finally able to board. By then nearly 30 minutes had passed and dozens of guests had been through ahead of us; the damage was done and our daughter was beside herself, so the entire experience was a complete waste of time and money.Awful staff management, zero demonstration of genuine customer service or lateral thinking, and an entire experience absolutely ruined for our daughter's 5th birthday.Your staff and management should be ashamed of themselves.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/ef/59/fa/nbpmelbourne.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r778191884-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

Our queue was Long and at times not moving at all and I soon realised it was because of large groups of corporate guests (people with tags and special arrangements in the cabins such as wine) who were allowed to jump the queue and bypass the normal guests to board the flyer first. I counted a total of 12 large groups who cut the queue and were allowed to board the flyer first the moment they arrive. Thus, our regular queue was moving at a snail's pace (and along corridors that was stuffy and warm). This is unacceptable.

Singapore Flyer,goose3nbc,Disappointment is an Understatement,20,8-Mar-18,"This was the biggest disappointment of our two week anniversary trip between Singapore, Bali and Taipei.My first activity I wanted to experience and share our special moment was with Singapore Flyer, and that never took place. Two weeks before our trip I received an automated e-mail stating due to technical difficulties the Flyer was not operational. We were given the option to immediately cancel or wait. As this was once in a lifetime trip, I was hopeful and waited. Three days later a second e-mail informing me the Flyer would likely not be operational and they would process a refund. IF YOU BOOK IN ADVANCE, YOU PAY AT TIME OF BOOKING. I have no issue with that to secure special events such as dinner or slings on board. When they cancel, you are informed refunds take 6 to 8 WEEKS. Unacceptable. Airlines refund quicker than this and they are notorious for cancellations.When we arrived in Singapore we learned more about the technical difficulties from locals. We also were informed management has changed in recent years and more ""technical difficulties"" have occurred where the Flyer is not operational. Two different tour operators told us they have recommended against bookings as this has become more recent with financial issues. Initially I would have thought ""that's just tour operators steering visitors to other things."" Then we visited the Singapore Flyer grounds. It was deserted, on a weekend afternoon less than 10 people we saw around the sprawling area of the Flyer. There has to be some validity if everyone is keeping away, and it's a shame. I always thought of the Flyer as an icon of Singapore. Yes, it's still lit at night and that's beautiful (hence 2 star and not 1). There is no timeline to get the Flyer operational, instead the same message is repeated on technical difficulties. If that's the case, be transparent and don't process refunds in 6 to 8 weeks. If guests are required to pay up front for bookings, finances should be in order to reimburse.Overall, extremely disappointed.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/16/b4/2a/5e/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r565268993-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

Attendants was off putting and rude, which is unusual here. Once on the car, the AC was obviously NOT working. Views were great but comfort was not. Shoddy service. Also kind of expensive at $33.

Singapore Flyer,RichardinSG,It's a very slow wheel,20,5-Nov-16,Don't mean to disparage but its kinda boring and too expensive.

Singapore Flyer,Peter S,Over-rated and over-priced,20,26-Oct-16,"The Singapore Flyer is an extremely dull ride, and at $33 per adult it is grossly over-priced.

It's a bit cheaper than the London Eye and it feels an awful lot slower.

I had to use pocket tissue.Also, to add insult to injury, the rotation was too short for dinner. You were rushed to finish dinner before the rotation was completed.

Singapore Flyer,Lindi B,Not as good as expected,20,14-Jan-16,The capsules are nice and of course the view is great but doing one round seems to take forever and it is quite pricey. At $33 per adult it seems a bit meh.You can get a great view from a place like Level 33 or 1 Altitude but have freedom to move around more and have a drink or use a bathroom.I think children will enjoy this attraction and if you want to go try and head there to catch sunset on the way up and night lights on the way down. From probably around 6:50 - 7:20pm as this is roughly sunset in Singapore.Overall it was clean and neat inside the capsule but would not do it again.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r339800188-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

Singapore Flyer,stanleyckw,On the hazy period,20,22-Dec-15,Strongly recommend that you should take it during night if you are supposed to make a visit to the Singapore Flyer.The entire ride will took around 30mins. The night scene is definitely one of the positives for it. It can be quite boring throughout the entire ride if you are supposed to take it alone as there is nothing else to do other than phototaking at the highest point.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r334251469-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

Singapore Flyer,Kelvin Y,whole largest perhaps,20,15-Dec-15,Under rated attraction. Oversee views but nothing historic unlike London Eye. Price is reasonable to upkeep the venue. But nothing amazing.

Singapore Flyer,Travelicious_K,Lots of better ways to enjoy the view,20,7-Dec-15,"We were quite excited about going on the flyer as we read a lot of positive reviews and their website made it seem like this was an experience not to be missed. Unfortunately, it was the total opposite. The place was quite dead on a Saturday night. There was no queue or massive throngs of people waiting to get on the flyer. The staff manning the lines of people getting on or off the flyer looked bored. It was just 5 of us in our pod. While I do admit that the view is quite pretty, it wasn't so stunning that you needed to pay $33 for it. There are many other ways to enjoy the view, like roof top bars or skyscrapers/skyrise buildings nearby. The entire 30 minute ride was slow and boring. Initially, we were contemplating on buying the Premium Champagne Flight tickets 'ì luckily we changed our minds at the last minute. That would have been a complete waste of $69. I wouldn't recommend this ride to anyone and based on the very few people we saw that night (it was a weekend), they don't seem to be attracting that much of a crowd.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r331117257-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

Singapore Flyer,gzau,OK view,20,27-Oct-15,The Singaproe Flyer is an OK way to have a look over the central business district of Singapore. I think it is about an hour ride like all the big ferris wheels sprouting over all the big cities in the world. Personally I think you get a better view going to the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and have a drink at the bar or dinner there. Of course the drinks/dinnner are expensive there but then you are not paying a fee to go on a ride.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/86/bf/3f/gzau.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r321977668-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

Too expensiveAt $33 a pop for less than 30 minutes on the flyer, it feels like burning too much for too little time2. It could do with a little bit more life.The food stalls, shops, even the workers feel loke they're just going through the motions of another day.3. Something moreI feel like there are some improvements that can be made to the place. Don't get me wrong, the place is absolutely beautiful. But there is potential to be unlocked in this place, i believe.All in all, if you're looking for somewhere for photo ops, I'd say Marina Bay Sands view deck is a better choice since you can actually stay for as long as you want and are not limited by plexiglass panels around.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/de/0a/default-avatar-2020-35.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r307966818-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

Seeing another couple come out from a pod solo we asked if we could have a pod to ourselves and were told no and instead they let empty capsules go (we had an empty one before and after U.S.). Aside from this all the staff at the attraction weren't talking to customers and seemed more interested in talking with one another.

Singapore Flyer,Ashwin B,Singapore Flyer,20,31-Jul-15,The Singapore Flyer is good for people who have not been on the other similar attractions. It does have a good view of the Marina Bay Area but that's about it. The booking clerk was very helpful and asked us to delay our trip by about an hour so that we could see the views in daylight as well as post nightfall with the citylights on. It would have been nice had there been some audio visual aid telling tourists about the sights visible as the flyer moved. The area around the flyer is quite underdeveloped with no activities and getting a taxi back after the ride was an hour long wait.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/88/36/6f/ashwinbagla.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r294318822-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html
Singapore Flyer,mattwatson74,The most awful and appalling customer experience,10,1-Aug-20,"On the 1st August 2020 I had a personally awful and quite traumatic experience at the Singapore Flyer (SF).Having waited in an external queue for 1 hour I was informed by the SF staff that it was a further 2 hour wait inside before boarding. Upon which I was given the option to reschedule my visit or wait in the queue.Considering it was now 8pm, the onsite manager did not seem to be concerned about the potential 10pm boarding time or the 1 hour queue which was following me. They had not been informed of the prospect of not being able to board the Singapore flyer within the advertised operating hours.I am appalled by this general disregard for the paying public and would hope the SF revise their operating procedures.In all fairness, upon request I have been promised a full refund, and I do plan to rebook in the future, but being conscious of and taking into account the poor operating procedures. I will allow 3 hours queuing time. With the hope of having an enjoyable experience at what could be a world leading attraction.It's just a shame that the customer experience focus has been lost.....maybe this is due to COVID-19, or maybe not? I will leave you to form your own opinion should you wish to visit the SF.Make sure you plan on a 3 hour queue and don't believe the the online time slots! Good luck!PS you would be better spending your money to have a cocktail at MBS rooftop....it's cheaper and the views are better.... #justsaying.....",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r762533388-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

There was no escape until the door was reopened again, after whole 20 more minutes!! We wanted to enjoy a quite Singapore night scene, not a market! If we wanted market we would visit local hawker food court! That was a nightmare!Look! I am not blamming those Koreans for having fun and party. But the operator should arrange them to another cell instead jamming all 17 people in one cell. (There was no other tourist waiting on the line as I saw!!) All other 6 people are keeping almost silence the whole tour.

Not only is it extremely slow, the views it gives isn't anything you can't see from other places like MBS or the hundreds of other bars boasting views.If you don't mind viewing the same thing for 30 minutes in a car full of other people who are too busy taking selfies to even look around, go ahead. This would not be on my list of things to do if I was only in Singapore for a couple days.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/66/8c/5c/misshur.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r243553223-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

Singapore Flyer,N_H83_38,BORING!!!,10,26-Sep-14,"This was the worst money we spent in Singapore.

Singapore Flyer,sonal0601,Boring and expensive,10,18-Aug-14,"Don't remember how much we paid, but it was quite a bit. Certainly regretted it. A very slow moving ferris wheel with views of the city (which you can easily see from any tall building in the area).

Singapore Flyer,MattBeerBennett,There are much better places to see Singapore from,10,10-Aug-14,"The daily trawl of tourists in coachloads from the package holidays, line up for a 'trip' in the Flyer. Unlike the superb London Eye, this similar looking wheel looks the same from the outside but on the inside offers a different experience. There is no guide to assist you as to what you are looking at, the air con is doing its best to keep you cool but struggles when you are in a sealed glass bowl on the equator and elevated nearer to the sun. Unlike the London Eye which is only surpassed by the Shard on height, you will spend much of the trip looking up at buildings as they are taller ! Several of these buildings also offer you free or cheaper access (except Marina Bay Sands which is $10 more). Also these other buildings offer refreshments, natural air and the option to go to the toilet if you've been over drinking water to keep you cool. Save time and money and do not even consider doing the very cheesy glass of champagne spin for $130. Rumour has it they are doing their best to repay the huge amount they spent on putting it up there. Finally, they put it in the wrong place. For a great view go to Altitude 1, OUE, Swissotel, UOB viewing floor or best of all Level 33 bar at the Standard Chartered Building.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/ce/1d/ee/mattbeerbennett.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r220865295-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

Singapore Flyer,RyanTYZ,Not worth the price and time up there,10,20-May-14,I've heard mix reviews for the flyer and had to see for myself.The verdict:1) The retro looking foodcourt reminiscent of our old Singapore days is good but pricey.2) It is nice to take a photo of the Singapore Flyer at night with its pretty lights (best spot is across the river)3) Your money will be better spent elsewhere if you want intend to pay to sit inside the flyer to see the Singapore skyline as there are better places like MBS skywalk or One Altitude,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/05/e3/f0/9a/ryantyz.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r206291084-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

Singapore Flyer,Rozaine s,Completely overpriced,10,7-Feb-14,"For 30 SGD, the Singapore flyer is terribly overpriced for a view and a 40-minute ride. First of all you need to share the ride with around 15-20 people. If you're lucky it'll be less. Maybe only 9 or so of you will get to sit on the seats in the centre of the compartment and the rest will have to stand, ostensibly at the edges looking out.I cannot fault the view, of course, but paying 30 bucks for this is absolutely ridiculous, considering you can get a similar good view for as long as you like by going to Pinnacle@Duxton at nearby Tanjong Pagar and heading to the top floor. You do need an EZ-Link card though (1 per person, so a little inconvenient) but considering you only pay 5 bucks for a view (and you get to stay as long as you like and sit and stand if you so wish) the Singapore flyer is truly a rip-off.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/40/9f/71/nerissa-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r193310944-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html
Singapore Flyer,Lyn M,Teenage son liked this,10,1-Jan-14,Son went on this & loved it. There are excellent food stalls under it at reasonable cost. Super fresh squeeze juice stall too--not dear. All the Hopon/hopoff buses park here so good spot to check them out & start circular tour from there. DO NOT get the cheapest one (orange colour) as they finish too early. I was surprised when I read timetable after I had paid.

You take photos for about 5 mins, then turn to your friends or relatives and find things to talk about.

Singapore Flyer,SJD1509,Zzzzz.........,10,25-Jun-13,"What a bore. The great thing about say the London Eye is that there are actually landmarks to spot on the way up and down. Singapore does not have these icon and historic buildings to look out for. If your idea of fun is going very slowly round in a circle looking at not a lot then go ahead.If you are going for the view and photo opportunities, best to keep your money (its not cheap for what it is) and head to Ku De Ta at the top of Marina Bay Sands. The money you saved on not going on the Flyer can be used to buy a refreshing drink and you get much better views and much better photos.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r165136749-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html

Singapore Flyer,mfiore10,Nightmare Ride Ended Up In Hospital (and costing me $200+) & If you are scared of heights. Don't do it!,10,11-Jan-13,My experience was single-handedly one of the most traumatic I've had while travelling. It was my last night in Singapore I had an accident at the building of the flyer. The proprietor of the cafe did not offer any assistance as I had hurt myself but after telling the staff on the flyer what had happened I managed (with persistence) to get a manager to talk to. In fact she sniffed her nose at me and continued talking (I did not enjoy the Singaporean customer service).I ended up being wheeled off the flyer in a wheelchair and slugged $200 for the most expensive hospital in Singapore (closest in the area) and then slugged again another $20 (ish) dollars for the taxi to get back to my hotel.This ruined the next part of my trip.Unfortunately there is not much that can be done to get my money back because the Singapore consumer affairs won't touch the matter and the Flyer have washed their hands clean of the matter but that is another issue not for this review...all I would say is don't get hurt on it!Putting aside my personal experiencePROSI had a private cabin with drinks.The Singapore Slinger is nice - but if you are scared of heights dutch courage is not going to help.Reaction time of the staff members.CONSThis is in the title. If you are scared of heights. Do not ride the wheel. I spent my night in pain and bawling my eyes out because I was terrified of the ride and the horrible experience. Not exactly the romantic night I planned eh?The view seems to be blocked by buildings - from the photos I've seen since I was too frightened to look around.Having to literally jump onto the flyer but yet was wheeled out afterwards.I am really glad I didn't pay for the dinner. An hour in pain plus the heights thing would have set me off a lot more.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/12/bc/06/e9/missfiore10.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r149411260-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html
Singapore Flyer,naldr6,So Borring.,10,6-Jan-13,"It was so borring, the line is a trick. They let 6 people out onto the deck so it looks like there is no line, though what they don't tell you is that its a giant building full of lines inside which take a further 30 minutes to get to the front of the line. Once on the flyer you will be amazed.....for the first 4 minutes, the next 26 minutes on the flyer will bore you to tears, and the worst part is you can't get out when you're done. If you're doing it for the views you're better off to vist the observation deck of the C, its about the same price same view and you can leave when you please!

Singapore Flyer,ilovemanhattanNyc,Like throwing $30 out the peak of the ride,10,1-Sep-12,"What a waste of time and money. This is about upselling you stuff to take home.If you want to see Singapore at night or during the day, you're better off with a reservation and eat or drink at top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel or paying the cost to go up there -- it is higher & a better view & you aren't stuck there for 45 minutes.Singapore could have made its rival to the London Eye worthwhile & do what London did - provide you with some information about what you are looking at, about the land reclamation projects, about where the original Singapore ended and about what you are seeing.But, nobody did that.Instead you are riding in a glass bubble for 45-odd minutes with no information on what you are looking at.All they have is a pamphlet in the bubble that is mainly advertisements for fast food (at the park where the ride is), stores & trinkets (you have to walk through a trinket-filled store to exit). The 4 or 5 items per each view (North, South, East and West) are on the bottom of the pamphlet in the corner.The pamphlet's information about ""Top 3 must-try food!"" and ""Top 3 merchandise to bring home!"" is bigger than the information about what you are viewing.No map. Nothing.There were 2 kids aged 8-11 in my bubble, and they were bored to tears & began climbing on everything.The London Eye is so, so, so much better for this kind of thing (there is a lot of history to see from it, but apparently nothing from the Flyer).What a disappointment.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/05/94/8a/04/ilovemanhattannyc.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d678639-r139025138-Singapore_Flyer-Singapore.html
