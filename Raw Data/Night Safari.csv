Night Safari,syuxsie,Great family experience,50,31-Jan-21,"Using the SRV was a breeze and it was the first time my family had come to the Nighy Safari together. It was a great experience and every staff we came across were friendly, professional and beyond helpful. We had come with my elderly grandmother in a wheelchair and the staff assisted with getting her on the tram ride. The tram is definitely a must-do!Special mention to Shu Wen from the souvenir shop who went the extra mile to assist me with a personal problem. Beyond grateful for her help.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/ec/cf/81/syuxsie.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r782062128-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,W599MOkareng,Attentive and considerate service,50,30-Jan-21,"Brought our elderly parents for their first time to the night safari and it was a pleasant experience. Since the last time I went was more than a decade ago, we didn't realise there was a long queue and wait for the popular Creatures of the Night show. Seeing we were probably looking kind of lost and my mum's mobility challenges, an attentive staff, Damian came forth to help us and made recommendations for us to go on the tram ride first and come back for the next show. He kindly helped us to the priority queue for the tram ride and when we came back later for the show, directed us to where my mum could sit more comfortably as we waited for our turn. Kudos and thank you to Damian and the staff at the Night Safari for their excellent service, friendliness and helpfulness!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r782018782-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,Chelsea B,Favourite ever zoo experience,50,11-Nov-20,"The world's first nocturnal zoo, I was particularly excited about this one. I had read many online reviews about how busy it was and how the queues were ridiculous. When you enter the zoo you have the option to go around the zoo by foot or by tram, we chose by foot and we didn't see another person our entire time there!We had so much fun, the pathways were very dark and it felt very eerie at times. The animal enclosures are lit in a way that is meant to resemble moonlight as not to disturb nocturnal animals, and we found we were really able to see a lot of activity from animals that we're so used to seeing napping in a corner.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1c/4d/f5/28/chelsea-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r776945326-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,antlynn119,Unique experience for family,50,26-Oct-20,Great time to visit. No crowds and safe distancing in place only downside is masks are mandatory all the time but it is for our safety! Great view of amazing animals roaming around at night and even touching distance (not recommended) while passing them on the tram ride. Walking paths meander through the park in dimly lit areas where you can see the animals in their nocturnal habitats. Really fun and kids loved it. Always come back and recommend to all visitors to Singapore.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r775637019-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,John_beck_10,Discounted Ticket Prices,50,23-Oct-20,Im going to the night safari is because of the discounted ticket prices.

Night Safari,angelo_govender,Good experience,50,22-Oct-20,"The night Safari was relatively decent. The only animals that were able to roam on the road were deer which was ok. Other than that we were able to see lion, rhino, hippo and a tiger alone with some flamingos. In total the whole team ride lasted about 20 odd minutes.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/11/1c/b1/45/angelo-g.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r775167882-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,Jingpei,World class experience,50,3-Oct-20,"Last visited about 25 years ago when it open as the world's first night safari. No major recollection except being on the tram and a deer chased our tram at one part.Managed to spent a little bit more time here this time round and walked through 1 or 2 of the trails, I must say the trails are more interesting than the tram rides. If you can afford more time to walk, definitely take the trails as there are more interesting things to see. The trip was thoroughly interesting except for the fact that thunderstorm brought an unexpected end. Nice experience to see the animals active at night in person rather than on TV.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/12/8b/af/facebook-avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r772849603-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Great views from the tram and you can even walk around on different trails. Helpful staff to guide you around.If you are not a fan of mosquitoes, be sure to take some repellent or cover yourself.There is always that one clumsy tourist whose camera flashes in the darkness, even though you are strictly told to turn your flash off.Observer the natural beauty with your eyes, forget about your camera.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ef/73/default-avatar-2020-13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r772171475-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,Grover R,Must see - Zoo like you have never experienced before,50,2-Apr-20,"Singapore has great animal parks, but the most unique and something you simply MUST SEE is the Night Safari. It really is the equivalent of the Zoo but a totally different experience. Most animals in zoos are nocturnal but you rarely get to see them at night. Night Safari is zoo experience that is only open at night. The park opens at twilight but quickly turns dark. It offers two great experiences, ride on a tram that winds through the park (some animal exhibits can only be seen by tram like the elephants) or the more adventurous walk along a path between exhibits at night. My wife and I really enjoyed the path and got to see numerous animals that you can only see at night. It was awesome to see the Fishing Cats, Asian otters, Leopards and Singapore natives Civet cat and Pangolin. We saw all 3 animal exhibits at the zoo, but this was a favorite because it was so unique. There is simply nothing like it.If you are combining with another park, you can come to the Night Safari and eat dinner before going in. There is also a sort of dance show before the park hopes that you can watch. In addition along the trail and in the Amphitheater, they do have animal shows that are both educational and entertaining. Again if you can only do one park, be sure to visit this one. The experience is that amazing.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/c0/f9/55/grover-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r752142288-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,neris2912,Still good as ever,50,21-Mar-20,"Visited the Night Safari in the middle of the Covid Outbreak. Good thing was that it was not crowded as I heard that during normal peak periods, it is really packed. Do buy your tickets online as the online prices are usually lower. Furthermore the ticket counter is located very far from the Night Safari Entrance which is rather ridiculous if you ask me. Do go as early as possible as I feel that you need minimally 3 hours to properly cover and appreciate the park without rushing through. Moreover the ticket prices are not cheap so you also want to maximise your value. It is a really unique and special experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone who comes to Singapore.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e6/ea/default-avatar-2020-54.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r751550064-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,yiwenfrsingapore,Wonderful night!,50,17-Mar-20,"I've visited the night safari before and i would say over the years there have been changes to the layout that makes it refreshing to visit again! Some interesting animals that i really enjoyed looking at include the Binturong, the flying squirrel and the Armadillo. The tram ticket was included in my visit so we were able to take a nice 45minutes tram ride, after walking along 2 trails. We visited on a sunday night so there weren't any lion and tiger feeding sessions, so if you'd like to catch those i recommend coming on a friday or saturday night.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/16/0c/af/2f/yiwenfrsingapore.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r751183817-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

The animals seem to come right up to your tram, in the dark you can't see the ditch that lies between you and them!

Night Safari,JDHTraveller,Amazing evening,50,5-Feb-20,"Night Safari is a separate facility from the Singapore Zoo, although it is adjacent to the zoo.

Night Safari,564sanja,Night safari,50,27-Jan-20,The night safari at Singapore is worth seeing. Only thing is that tickets needs to be booked in advance and it should be with tram car ride as it is next to impossible to walk the entire safari. The tram ride takes around 40 mts and the tickets for entry is at 19.15 and 20.15. Secondly a pick up and drop is required as it is some distance away and in the night buses might not be available .

We then did all of the walking tracks. At first we couldn't see anything so were worried we wouldn't get our money's worth but patience is a virtue! We saw nearly all the animals including elusive leopards, fishing cats and pangolins.Even though it is busy, I recommend the earlier sessions as everybody goes on the team first and you can get the walking trails to yourself.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/3f/83/8c/ninjakitten007.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r741082792-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,Patmar2501,Love it!,50,11-Jan-20,We bought the 8.15pm tickets and after entering we were promptly told over the loud speaker as well as as we were moving through the ticketing gate that we could go a certain way to get on the tram or you could go another way if you wanted to walk around. We had a tired tween so we took the tram ride which was informative and maybe we were just lucky but we saw loads of animals. after the tram ride did it's circuit we then lined up for about 15 minutes for the night show. Fabulous. If you've been to a few zoo's it's not the absolute most awesome show I've seen but well worth it and I wouldn't suggest missing it. You could have then walked around again if you wanted to as the Zoo is open until very late but we left after the the once around tram ride and show.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/11/default-avatar-2020-41.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r738371475-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,jjc978,Brilliant Different Way To See Animals,50,6-Jan-20,Really loved it here. Used the food court before going in which was good value and tasty. The land train around the zoo was great and saw most of the animals. This lasted about 30 minutes. Then walking around the zoo and having time to properly see the animals was great. At times a little freaky when hyenas disappear into the shadows not that far from you. Couldn't get into the creatures show as always fully booked and wasn't wasting 45 minutes queuing for it.

Night Safari,angadsinggg,Safari Singapore,50,3-Jan-20,One of the best experiences to see animals at night with an amazing concept of travelling in trams which goes around the whole zoo.

Night Safari,Familyguyandgal,Wonderful experience!,50,21-Dec-19,"Having read other reviews, we weren't too sure what to expect but it was an amazing experience. We were lucky as we had a bright, calm night and so we saw all the animals. The tram ride was good to get bearings and to see the lions in particular which were beautiful. We saw the Asiatic and African lions and they were active and roaring and feeding. The Fishing Cat Trail was great - amazing just to be walking through a zoo at night. It was pretty quiet and we saw the leopards at incredibly close range. The mouse deer were gorgeous as was the fishing cat. We didn't see the shows as we wanted to prioritise seeing the animals as the children were tired. We didn't have to queue for anything including the tram but maybe that's because we went on a Monday evening. An amazing experience and would definitely recommend.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r733859335-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,takeabreakInCruises,Interesting,50,6-Dec-19,"It is very interesting place, like most places in Singapore. Very informative to take the train first and then walk through the park. Most animals are active at night because it is not so hot.Be prepared to spend lots of time in long lines to get tickets, then to get to the point of entry. Arrive there an hour or two before the time you plan to get in. Tickets sold fast! Even if you buy tickets online ( like we did), you still need to get to the ticket booth to get the paper tickets. Remember that after midnight all public transportation is closed and only taxi is available ( double price after midnight) and it is long line for taxi.

It was sort of weird in that it was billed as seeing the animals alive in their natural nocturnal environment, yet some of them were asleep.

Night Safari,Rich4053,Its been 10 years...,50,13-Nov-19,"Its been more than 10 year since my last visit but Night Safari is as good as before if not better. First, complement to their excellent customer service, I booked the ticket online for the visit on 27 Oct but due to the downpour on that day their customer service allow me to change the visting date not once but twice.We finally visited the place on 9 Nov, we booked 8 pm but due to huge crowd we can't even attend the 8.30 show. So we decided to walk the trail first, the fun start when everyone is trying to spot the animal in the dark. Back to the show place an hour later to catch the 9.30pm show, it is very entertaining and at same time educational. After that we move on to the fire show at the entrance, this one is definitely better than 10 years ago, it last for about 10 min. We move on the see the luminal forest, it is amazing, after that we go back to Night Safari again to catch the tram even it is already 11.15 pm but we are glad to do so as now you can easily see many big animals that we was unable to see earlier. We ended the trip at 12pm.

Thank you very much Emmy with your genuine kindness shown to us, you were fantastic and we hope we will again visit the zoo soon. We would highly recommend a jeep tour rather than the train as it's quieter and the animals come towards you thinking we are going to feed them (they recognise the jeep as having Zookeepers ready to feed them).Is was almost like a real safari in the wilderness.

The 'friendly'ù species are even open-range, so that they completely surrounded the trolly as we passed.

Night Safari,junde01,Really great experience,50,4-Nov-19,"We really enjoyed the night train at the Zoo last night in Singapore. We took the 815pm train which loaded quickly despite the fairly large queue. The animals were many and diverse with lions, tigers, deer of several types, hippos, rhinos, hyenas, elephants, tapirs and many more. Our Sunday night was fairly quiet apparently and a good night to go. Buy tickets online first for best access but we had no trouble really. Food options not fantastic - eat first or later. We have never had such a wonderful night time animal experience.

I would recommend planning your time around the two main attractions- the Creatures of the Night Show and also the tram tour of the park. The show was excellently produced, with a great host and magnificent, intelligent creatures. We ended up walking all the trails to get a closer view of the animals- a circuit of the park took around 90 minutes.A highly recommended night out in Singapore.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r723535676-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,michellev415,"Lions, tigers and... oh wait, yeah there's a bear too",50,26-Oct-19,"My partner and I pre-booked night safari before we left for Singapore - and that did save waiting in line for tickets.The later you go the less crowds there are and lines for the bus tour and live show are smaller. Also with less people the animals are more likely to come out of hiding. We got there at around 8.30 and after 9.30 crowds were starting to dwindle. We got a cab to and from the safari. It was pretty straightforward.What I enjoyed most was the walking trails. They're short but you can go at your own place unlike with the bus, where you stop for 20 seconds and then move along.Also, a tip for other visitors PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR FLASH AND TORCH. They're nocturnal animals and sensitive to the light - why are you holding the light up in its face like you're interrogating the poor thing?

Night Safari,MrsShariP,"Safari, so good",50,20-Oct-19,Following the theme of Singapore's respect of animal space and habitats the Night Safari is a perfect example of bringing the beautiful animals of the night to the public without messing with their sleep patterns.This park offers you the option to walk or take a shuttle to see the exhibits. We walked first as the line for the shuttle was so long (it didn't really get any shorter) but you really have to do both. You wont see all the animals on display if you only do one.The dim lighting and forbidden flash photography add a level to the animal's comfort that you don't see too much.I also recommend coming over from the zoo and eating at the multiple cuisine venue at the entrance of the night safari. The prices are reasonable and if you head over before the zoo closes and the safari opens it's much less crowded.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/a1/12/33/shari-p.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r719838709-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,Ztarr89,One of a Kind Night,50,9-Oct-19,"My boyfriend & I came to Singapore for a quick vacation & one of the things I was excited to do was to visit the Night Safari as I had never been to one before. After reading other reviews, I had decided to book the Night Safari Adventure Tour as it was a smaller tour that allowed for a more personal experience & a chance to feed elephants - something neither I or my boyfriend had done before! On our way to the safari, we learned the hard way that Singapore traffic can be truly horrendous & ended up showing up almost an hour late for the tour. However, our tour guide, Lana, was fantastic & rearranged the tour for us so that we would see the show, Creatures of the Night, at a later viewing, while still being apart of our original tour for the rest of the time. She did a fantastic job telling us about all the exhibits & animals & answered all & any questions my boyfriend & I had.

Night Safari,ewsa10,Brilliant,50,7-Oct-19,You'll wait a while in the queue - but the end result is well worth it! The Night Safari is just exactly that - a chance for you to be driven around (or walk - but the wee electric train is really super) and see the animals in their natural nighttime environment. It has been very cleverly designed/put together and it complemented our day trip to the zoo no end. Definitely worth paying the extra for and an experience not to forget!,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0a/c9/aa/4f/ewan-a.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r716009258-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

No queues at all and fairly quiet, the trams were half full.The tram ride was brilliant, it took its time and we got to see all the animals up close. We then opted for the walking trails which were brilliant.The rainforest lumina was a lot of fun. We were the last group to go in (around 11pm) and the whole place was to ourselves. Definitely recommend.All staff were friendly and helpful with very good English.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/a9/e9/61/nay93.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r714281719-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,MVarma,Cool safari with amazing staff,50,27-Sep-19,"We decided to visit the night safari on our first night in Singapore. Our son (4yrs) loves animals so we thought this would be a great family experience. We didnt buy tickets in advance which was a mistake, if you do go buy the tickets online, you will save yourself so much time and avoid the chaos.Our son was excited all the way through the queue until he saw that the tram goes in the dark and he has a complete panic attack, refusing to sit on the tram. The park staff took us off and told us they would put us on the next one once my son had calmed down. But he still wouldn't. But one on the park employees - Damion was amazing, we are so grateful for how he helped us to try and calm down our son, and how he and all the other lovely employees really wanted our family to enjoy this experience.They arranged for our family to have a private buggy, so our son wasn't overwhelmed by all the people on the tram and got to see all the animals he loves and we got to have a really cool experience! Especially seeing the elephants. They even arranged front row seats at the show, but our son was too tired by this point to cope sitting through a show.We have so much gratitude for Damion, Femi, and the other staff who went above and beyond normal customer service. Their care and patients created a beautiful family experience for us that we will always remember. To put it in the word of my 4yr old, that was so awesome...let's go again.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r713224425-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,Pritpal P,Great Zoo,50,20-Sep-19,"Get in early (at opening time) to enjoy it. The first thing we did was get into the queue for the tram ride. It was near dusk so not quite dark when we went in, but the queue was 20-30 minutes and fully dark when the tram started.We saw almost every animal that the tram passed (elephants, lions, tigers, etc). After the tram, we started with the trails. Walking around the zoo at night was a novel experience. I'd say that there was a 50% chance of seeing most things the train takes you past (some animals were still hiding, while others were very visible).We took our time wondering around, and even stopped to listen to a talk being given at the wallaby's.If your going to the Creatures of the Night show, make sure to sit in the middle section. We ended up at the right hand side and some of the animals were out of sight for us.We didn't bother with the illumination walk...",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r711354689-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,343cameronh,Do the adventure safari tour,50,16-Sep-19,After getting a recommendation from my parents to do the night safari I looked online and saw that there was a semi private experience where you get a guided tour of the night safari. Wasn't cheap but 100% do it. We were lucky and only shared the experience with another couple. We were treated like VIP and didn't have to wait at all anywhere. A special buggy takes you everywhere the 'train'ù takes you however at a much slower pace and you can stop right in front of the lions etc for photos. In fact I actually felt guilty for people not doing the experience as multiple trains went past and we were parked right in front of the action. The guide was fantastic. Very passionate about his job and the animals at the park. The absolute highlight was feeding the elephants at the end. Something I'll never forget and I felt way more comfortable doing this than any animal tourist experience I've seen in other countries which I've avoided out of concern for the animals. Would recommend!,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/19/65/71/dd/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r710263469-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,NinaAsia,Very enjoyable solo visit,50,11-Sep-19,"The Night Safari only opens at 7:15pm. But plan to get there early to catch the Thumbuakar Fire show at 6:45pm. As soon as the safari opens, proceed to your right and catch the first show of Creatures of the Night at 7:15pm. Both shows are very entertaining!After the show, do not join the crowds to catch the trams to take the 30 minute ride around the park. Tram 1 ( English tour) has a very very long queue so don't waste your time. Instead do the 3 walking trails first. Yes it can be very dark and scary but there are park personnel at some places to help you. You will get adrenaline rushes from time to time. For me, it was when I realised the spotted hyena was too close for comfort. But there were nice surprises like I saw a little bat sucking on banana juice strategically placed along a path on the fishing cat trail. Unfortunately it's very shy and will fly off when more people come.I caught tram no. 1 at 8:45pm. By then, there was no longer a queue. The tram ride showed many animals you cannot see on the walking trails. Sometimes the animals like the tapir, some deer were less than a meter away from the tram that night.A very enjoyable 3 hour visit!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/f0/4b/7b/ninaasia.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r708693533-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

We enjoyed it tremendously because:1. It was very well organized. The crowd control feels exactly like Disney World in Florida. So don't worry about the large crowds that go there!2. The program consists of two parts (1) a 30+/- minutes tram ride wherein one can see certain animals such as elephants; tigers; african lions; etc and then (2) your choice of walks: either a long, medium or short walks. During these walks one can see other animals not seen during the tram ride; OR, one can also re-visit the animals already seen.3. Both parts of the program kept our young grand kid's attention and motivated him to WALK in the Singaporean heat! The adults were also captivated by the experience.4.

Night Safari,sgsheep,Tips to make Night Safari a good experience!,50,12-Aug-19,"We are regular visitors to the Singapore zoo - and we have in tow a 2.5 years old. We recently braved a visit to the Night Safari the first time (our last time there were when we were both kids - and we have not returned earlier as it is famous for its crowd). All three of us had a great time.I was surprised myself.1) *Find a way to get in the priority queue.* WRS members get priority. Elderly and folks with disabilities are also given priority. If you booked certain tours you are also given priority.2) *Do NOT take the tram. Do the trails first.* You would have waited in LONG lines 2x (ticketing counter, the queue to enter the park even though there is a timing allocated) after you manage to clear the ticket gate. You will see another long line ahead (where 95% of people head to) for the tram. NO do not join that line. Look at your map - walk to the left and right and start the trails.3) *Nocturnal animals are mostly SMALL animals.* The majority of the interesting exhibits are along the trails. You will never be able to see an owl or a porcupine on a moving tram 50m away from the little guy in a rainforest at night.4) *Finding the animals is part of the fun.* This is a zoo, not a circus. Don't expect to easily spot all the animals listed on the map. The flying squirrels live on trees in tropical rainforests - finding something on a rainforest tree at night is definitely not easy. The hyena may decide to hide when you are there. Go with the right expectation and mindset - the keepers are around and they helped us find some animals.5) *There are many interesting animals that are (as far as I can remember) not in the day zoo.* Things like the babirusa, bongo, hyena, tarsier, porcupine, civets, various cats, flying squirrels, cloud leopard - just to name a few.6) *Do not leave when everyone is leaving.* We did not watch the show at the end of our visit - because we do not want to leave with the show crowd. There are plenty of cabs around and we managed to get one within 10min in line.We didn't take the tram, we didn't watch the show - but we didn't feel like we missed anything and we loved it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/fb/3b/7f/sgsheep.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r697820841-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,NICHOLAS T,Unique night safari,50,11-Aug-19,"Buying tickets in advance for Singapore night safari is to be strongly recommended if the enormous queues on our arrival - at 8:15pm - and departure - at 9:45pm - is anything to go by. Luckily we had done just that. We had got a taxi to the zoo, a fair way out of central Singapore - not bad value at 25 dollars, although cheaper shuttle bus and other travel options are available.Having seen the huge queues for the teams which drive people around the zoo, we opted to tackle the visit on foot. I think this was worthwhile, as it seemed to get us much closer to a number of enclosures. There were a few ups and downs but it was not a long walk.There were a few Jurassic Park moments during our walk, arriving at enclosures and not being able to see any sign of the animal it was supposed to house, but not too many and the big animals - lions, tiger and crocodiles were all out and about when we arrived - we were also lucky enough to witness the feeding of the lion (9pm) and tiger (9:30pm). Other animals included wallabies, deer, flying foxes (open enclosure), warthogs, various exotic cats and porcupine.As far as zoos go, they appeared to offer relatively generously sized enclosures, although they could always be bigger.

Night Safari,604lisan,Amazing,50,8-Aug-19,"We opted to do the night safari tour with dinner. We booked through a Tour service and if you don't want to be stuck for hours waiting in line to board one of the trains at the zoo, you need to do this as tour participants get priority. The views of the animals on the safari was up close and amazing. After wards you can also walk around to view more animals or see one of the shows. Dress lightly as it is even more humid at the zoo than other areas of Singapore. A terrific experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/a6/70/1d/lisa-n.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r696771559-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,Patty N,Great Experience !,50,5-Aug-19,"After hearing so much about the night safari in Singapore, I finally have the chance to visit (with friends), and will definitely come back and visit again with my (teens) children.A night experience that indeed show you a lot about the wildlife, and what they do at night. Taking the tour bus (included) was great seeing all the (nocturnal) animals. We also walked all the trails and got closer look at the animals.Remember to get there early, as the queues are always long. Do online booking if possible & you can go straight to the gate.Highly recommended to families.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/51/1f/99/patn201408.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r695625342-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,DP_StL,"A different, and enjoyable, zoo experience",50,3-Aug-19,"My family loves zoos. We have been to zoos all over the world, and this experience was unique. We have been living in Singapore, so asked around for tips before going. We opted for the 8:15 tickets, which meant we were not in the first wave crowd. It made for a late night, but we went on a weekend evening so no one was sleepwalking through the next day. If you are on vacation, then I think the 8:15 is the best slot. We also did not do the tram first, but instead walked around the entire park first. We took water bottles, and the park has chilled water dispensers for free refills. The whole walk is about 2.5 km, with some up and down hills, but we took about 2 hours to do it. It is crowded at first, but the further you walk from the entrance the more sparse the crowds. We took time at each exhibit, and found the animals in most. It is important to realize that a lot of the animals can only be seen on foot, and there are others, like the elephants, that can only be seen from the tram. A docent, Ziyi, started talking to us at the owl exhibit and really engaged our girls in discussions about the animals. He ended up walking (leading) with us the rest of the zoo, and this really enriched our experience! He was knowledgeable about the animals, and also expert at finding them, and explaining what they were doing.After the walking tour, we went to the tram, which had no line and was not crowded at all. This allowed us to take pictures in all directions, and really enjoy the tour. I would definitely recommend walking first (even if only part of the whole trail) to avoid the lines - it makes the Tram experience so much easier and better.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r695140611-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,Ashley P,Fascinating Experience,50,30-Jul-19,"My traveling companion in Southeast Asia was a zoologist, so we went to just about every zoo in the region. I definitely recommend this one. The focus on nocturnal animals is unique and interesting. You can take the walking trails, which are heavily landscaped and feel like walking through an actual jungle, and/or ride the tram, which gets you closer to some of the habitats. A great experience -- highly recommended.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/42/fe/41/ashley627.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r693807180-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,Carolyn C,PLAN AHEAD for a great visit,50,25-Jul-19,"With a bit of research and planning, a visit to Singapore's Zoo Night Safari is worth it for a close up encounter to many animals you will likely never see in the wild.We arrived at the zoo after a long MRT ride during rush hour to the Ang Mo Kio stop, transferring to bus # 138 opposite the MRT station in the AMK (Ang Mo Kio) Hub. This process took about an hour and 1/2. Once we arrived at the zoo we followed the signs for ticketing since I had ordered and paid for the tickets on-line. The zoo was complete chaos. So many people!!! Once we were in the tram line for an 815 pm departure, an employee instructed the crowd to skip the tram line and do the walking trails. He stated that the tram ride was available until 11pm and the crowds would be lighter the later we went. We REALLY should have listened to this advice. The queue for the tram took us 45 minutes to go through in the sticky heat and humidity, surrounded by chattering crowds. Once we got on the tram, the chattering didn't stop until I started saying ""shhhh"" and others caught on. However, we were unfortunate to have one young woman sitting behind us who just couldn't seem to stay silent during the tram ride :-(. BUT, overall the tram ride was amazing, and we saw some exceptional animals, full of activity. After the tram ride, we walked back through the zoo on the trails and this was very special. I do wish that the zoo would do the following:1) Have written instructions on how to get the most out of the experience, instead of just having an employee shouting instructions into a microphone;2) Encourage patrons to be more respectful by limiting loud voices and conversations. The animals don't like it and many of us human beings do not care for it either.3) Increase the message of conservation. The time for casual conversation is over. Our planet is in a climate crisis and human beings are the largest contributing factor.On a side note, I really appreciated the many water filling stations available by the restrooms.

Night Safari,Carolyn C,PLAN AHEAD for a great visit,50,25-Jul-19,"With a bit of research and planning, a visit to Singapore's Zoo Night Safari is worth it for a close up encounter to many animals you will likely never see in the wild.We arrived at the zoo after a long MRT ride during rush hour to the Ang Mo Kio stop, transferring to bus # 138 opposite the MRT station in the AMK (Ang Mo Kio) Hub. This process took about an hour and 1/2. Once we arrived at the zoo we followed the signs for ticketing since I had ordered and paid for the tickets on-line. The zoo was complete chaos. So many people!!! Once we were in the tram line for an 815 pm departure, an employee instructed the crowd to skip the tram line and do the walking trails. He stated that the tram ride was available until 11pm and the crowds would be lighter the later we went. We REALLY should have listened to this advice. The queue for the tram took us 45 minutes to go through in the sticky heat and humidity, surrounded by chattering crowds. Once we got on the tram, the chattering didn't stop until I started saying ""shhhh"" and others caught on. However, we were unfortunate to have one young woman sitting behind us who just couldn't seem to stay silent during the tram ride :-(. BUT, overall the tram ride was amazing, and we saw some exceptional animals, full of activity. After the tram ride, we walked back through the zoo on the trails and this was very special. I do wish that the zoo would do the following:1) Have written instructions on how to get the most out of the experience, instead of just having an employee shouting instructions into a microphone;2) Encourage patrons to be more respectful by limiting loud voices and conversations. The animals don't like it and many of us human beings do not care for it either.3) Increase the message of conservation. The time for casual conversation is over. Our planet is in a climate crisis and human beings are the largest contributing factor.On a side note, I really appreciated the many water filling stations available by the restrooms.

Night Safari,Carolyn C,PLAN AHEAD for a great visit,50,25-Jul-19,"With a bit of research and planning, a visit to Singapore's Zoo Night Safari is worth it for a close up encounter to many animals you will likely never see in the wild.We arrived at the zoo after a long MRT ride during rush hour to the Ang Mo Kio stop, transferring to bus # 138 opposite the MRT station in the AMK (Ang Mo Kio) Hub. This process took about an hour and 1/2. Once we arrived at the zoo we followed the signs for ticketing since I had ordered and paid for the tickets on-line. The zoo was complete chaos. So many people!!! Once we were in the tram line for an 815 pm departure, an employee instructed the crowd to skip the tram line and do the walking trails. He stated that the tram ride was available until 11pm and the crowds would be lighter the later we went. We REALLY should have listened to this advice. The queue for the tram took us 45 minutes to go through in the sticky heat and humidity, surrounded by chattering crowds. Once we got on the tram, the chattering didn't stop until I started saying ""shhhh"" and others caught on. However, we were unfortunate to have one young woman sitting behind us who just couldn't seem to stay silent during the tram ride :-(. BUT, overall the tram ride was amazing, and we saw some exceptional animals, full of activity. After the tram ride, we walked back through the zoo on the trails and this was very special. I do wish that the zoo would do the following:1) Have written instructions on how to get the most out of the experience, instead of just having an employee shouting instructions into a microphone;2) Encourage patrons to be more respectful by limiting loud voices and conversations. The animals don't like it and many of us human beings do not care for it either.3) Increase the message of conservation. The time for casual conversation is over. Our planet is in a climate crisis and human beings are the largest contributing factor.On a side note, I really appreciated the many water filling stations available by the restrooms.

There were many people but the attendants were helpful in how they assisted us to the right location.The Safari show was very entertaining and the host was superb and got the crowd into the experience. The animals were well trained and a lot of fun.The actual Safari demonstrated an amazing layout of a variety of animals. My only disappointment was that we traveled through it a little too quickly. I would have liked it to be a bit slower.I was amazed at how quickly the time went. I also want to encourage Singapore Zoo in its efforts in wildlife education and conservation.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r688706282-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,estokoe14,Is that a pig-dog?,40,27-Jan-20,"We were torn whether to visit the Night Safari or Singapore Zoo but chose this as it seemed like a unique experience - and we certainly weren't disappointed.On arrival, most people head straight to the tram so we walked along the paths instead. This place has a very special atmosphere and it was wonderful to see the animals start to quietly emerge as it got darker. After we'd walked everywhere we saw the show (fun but probably aimed more for kids), and then got on the tram for the drive around. Do try to do a bit of walking as well as the tram - we saw some animals one way but not the other and vice versa.I'd highly recommend this place as I've never come across anything quite like it and it's a much more manageable temperature to be walking around than in the day! Takes about 45min-1 hour to get there in a taxi from the centre.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r688631596-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,cocosmoke,"Walk around first, then tram",40,12-Jan-20,"We had a great time at the night safari during a long Friday evening layover at the airport. We booked 7:15 tickets on online but underestimated the length of the taxi que and busy peak hour traffic from the airport (50min travel) about ($40 Sing Dollars) and got there late. To not spend time waiting in lines we walked around the zoo first, it took 1 1/2 hrs then got on a quarter full tram (no line) for the 40 min ride. Whilst the day zoo is a better experience if you only have time to do one. For repeat visitors, the night zoo was awesome to see animals up and active. Our 10yr and 12yr boys really enjoyed it. We left at 10:20pm. Plenty of taxis waiting at the rank and we're back at the airport 25 mins later.

Night Safari,Docklander20,A zoo with a difference.,40,6-Jan-20,Book tickets on the website as you get a discount but be careful since you can easily book the wrong ticket. Go for the 7.15pm slot if you can get it as you may have to queue for the tram and if you do the walking trails you may run out of time to see the animals of the night show. The tram is a must since you will miss some of the major animals such as elephant and lion.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/b8/default-avatar-2020-26.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r686783931-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

You do need to queue up to visit this attraction and then queue again to get onto the tram that takes you around the complex. The audio was informative but at times poor quality.

What I would suggest is book the 8.15 or even later time for the safari, then do the fishing cats and walking tour that can take as long as you like, then when the crowds have died down get on the safari trams. Park doesn't close till midnight so plenty of time. Much better than cueing for an hour plus. The animal enclosures were quite nice, not a huge selection of animals but it was nice.

My kids (11 and 8) really enjoyed the night safari, they were very excited to see lions, rhinos, and bears. Everyone sits in a tram that drives relatively slowly around the park, with a recording that informs you of what animals are on which side of the tram (there are animals on both sides, though probably the person sitting on the right hand side (when you are seated facing forward) has a better view. You can see the animals, though the lighting is fairly low so it's not great visibility. The tram stops fairly briefly for people to see, then it moves on. Getting good photos is difficult. The whole thing was over fairly quickly, however the kids were so excited and enjoyed it so much I feel it was worth it and a great experience",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/19/a0/47/1d/tanyab1192.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r677528458-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

We didn't know, so we waited for 30-40 minutes for the tram ride: it was nice but the wait took away almost all the time we had for wandering around before heading back to the bus.

Night Safari,Fussy08,Fantastic experience,40,3-Oct-19,For a family with young children book your tickets early in advance but also an early timeslot that will be dark as well to try and alleviate the tiredness setting in too early. It was a really interesting experience going it at night time. When watching shows I recommend sitting at the back but also at the aisle to make a quick exit for the tram. It was crowded when we went and some tourists can be quite pushy. Overall good experience. Also have dinner before you go in and have it not at the zoo or just be prepared for those tourist prices.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/8d/avatar014.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r677382589-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,RobE1155,Enjoyable visit,40,11-Sep-19,"We went with four other friends and had a buffet dinner before the tram trip around the zoo at night. They arranged to pick us up at our hotel and bused us there. Our guide was called Bas(although his name was much longer). He gave us a very entertaining commentary on the bus trip to the zoo. He told us lots of facts about the zoo and about Singapore. Our group of 6 thoroughly enjoyed his banter and jokes. The buffet dinner we were served was surprisingly good. A wide choice of very tasty food. The service in the dining area for drinks etc was faultless. Then Bas led us to our tram, to travel around the zoo. The trip around the zoo took about 45 minutes. The running commentary on the tram was informative and interesting. Obviously the trip was during the night, so some of the animals were a bit hard to see, but i think we saw most of them pretty well. We then had the opportunity to walk some of the trails through the zoo. We did a couple of them, but it was pretty hot and humid, so we made our was back to the exit with about 15 minutes to spare before our due pick up time. Bas then told us which bus to get on for the trip back to our hotel. He again, was very informative on the way back. We then were transferred to a smaller bus to get us back to our hotel. Overall, this was a well organised and enjoyable experience. The only thing I would comment on, is maybe improving the signage on the walking trails. But this is a very minor point. I would recommend this tour highly.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0e/e9/70/b5/rob-e.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r676722849-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,Jirka_Kotek,Nice experience,40,10-Sep-19,"This was I think our best experience in Singapore.We went in at 19:30 and there weren¬¥t so many people. The train ride was nice and you can actualy see a lot of animals. Big advantage against regular zoo is that at night they are usually way more active.We also went for Creatures of the night show and unless you are bringing children you can skip it I think. It is cute and all, but not really that interesting for an adult.After that you can spend approximately 1,5 hour walking through the safari. Some of exhibits are very nice (giant bats, otters, mouse deer), other made me a little sad (jaguar) But overally it was nice experience.Still recommend to do to Malaysia and spend night in actual jungle though :-)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/16/70/0f/de/9jirkak.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r676445775-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,MARK P,Animals in Natural Environments,40,6-Sep-19,"It is rather astonishing how much people think in a place like this that the animals should be arranged purely and entirely for their own entertainment. If visiting here, one has to accept that you'll get to see some of the animals but not others. There's an element of chance, and that's OK.The reality is the views you do get are sensational and magical. The reality is that to see these animals in natural environments in the hours of dark is wonderful.If there was a disappointment it was that we'd bought a package that included a dinner. The Indian food was OK, but not stunning. It also felt very odd to sit and eat in a large space where there were no other people. 'Drinks' basically consisted of water only.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/f4/75/64/markpgurgaon.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r676203110-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

We ended up with the 8:15 slot and many of the animals were hiding / sleeping (which was a little disappointing). We also walked the whole thing (about 3 miles) because the line was long for the tram ride. If you're going to walk, wear comfortable shoes and bring water (they allowed me to bring my own water bottle). Also, it was very hot, even at night - so be prepare to sweat.All in all though, it was a great experience!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/15/7a/27/ea/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r674194284-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,MRS616,Really worth doing - don't believe the critics,40,26-Aug-19,"I had a very limited time schedule in singapore and after reading reviews here I almost didn't do this because there were so many negatives. However friends who live in singapore told us it was a must see and gave us tips on missing the crowds. It was really worth doing but I think it is worth reading the following tips:Tips:1. It takes a long time to get here on public transport (this Is surprisingly information that isn't emphasised anywhere I found). If you are planning to do the MRT to ang mo kio and then the bus there, it does go straight to the doors but the bus ride is quite long (and it's a public bus so it stops multiple times on the way). It takes around 35-40 minutes on the bus (in light traffic) so be aware of this and factor an hour total travel time if doing the above. I personally would just take a taxi if I went next time (a 'grab'ù taxi from the city will cost around 18-20 dollars). We took a standard taxi home (to novena area) and it cost around 35 bucks, grab is much cheaper (Uber equivalent in singapore which is pretty good).2. GO LATER (perhaps aim to arrive between 2000-2100, go watch sunset first somewhere else) and aim to do the tram ride later when most people have gone. We had this advice from friends and basically we took the last tram ride (2215) and the queue was minimal (maybe 10 minutes). Friends have said definitely don't queue up for the tram rides before 2100 as it is packed (note queuing is the cause of most of the negative reviews).3. If you decide to go a bit earlier than 2100 then do all the walking trails FIRST and then the tram ride later. There are a lot of great animals you won't see on the tram at all, and you will see much closer up and have time to appreciate including tigers and leopards. Also on the tram there are animals that you don't see but then I ended up seeing on the walking tracks (eg. I saw the lions and the leopard which I missed on the tram). Factor around an hour at least to do the walking tracks at pace, more if you want to dawdle and read all the info etc. I think it's actually more enjoyable than the tram....4. The tram ride is not that enjoyable, as it is ruined by Chinese tourists talking loudly and incessantly so you can barely hear the commentary. Also the commentary is a real Disney style pre-recorded blurb, it's sad they don't choose to have the driver do a live commentary. There are a few (not that many) areas that you won't get to see on walking tracks though, so it is still worth doing.So in conclusion it's a really good experience and you see some great animals - just take my advice and- arrive later- do walking tracks first and tram after to avoid huge queues for tram- factor at least 2 hours for the whole visit- factor in an hour to get there if using public transport (I would take a grab taxi!)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r673717013-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,Pereira_JC,A great attraction that is slowly getting let down by majority of its on ground staff.,40,19-Aug-19,"I visit the Night Safari at least 2-3 times annually. We love the facility and the drama of the night zoo. It's evolved so much over the years and it's the only attraction I proudly bring my overseas guest to (even those who have gone to S.Africa to see the big 5).On my last visit in July (8:15pm slot) we were still excited to go however, upon being told to move forward to the 8:15pm (by someone who already validated my ticket) I was shouted at by on of the Q - minders whom I flashed my ticket too. He shouted ""Hello?! What's that?!. I was puzzled and told him this is the e-ticket on my mobile phone. He then said, that's not the ticket. I was puzzled and then realized that while I was walking forward, the tickets had scrolled to the Rain forest Lumnia (It was a package - so the RFL ticket was before the NS ticket and we has 6 tickets in total). I told him, oh of course its the correct ticket, it was checked already and it must have moved.... He then replied curtly, I cannot touch your phone. So I showed it to him again. All this despite being checked to enter the 815pm Q earlier. I know he was making sure but, he could have asked nicely or been trained to identify how a packaged e-ticked was displayed.The other disappointment aspect was all the staff on ground. At least 80% looked and sounded like they did not want to be there.... This was not the attraction I was used to visiting. Smiling and welcoming on ground staff.. waving at the trams as they pass by, all I saw and heard were glum faces, and shouts at everyone (yes it was very crowded) but, shouting at guest to hurry up and move and fill up the tram seats was uncalled for.... it was noisy and unprofessional. They were obviously untrained and stressed. 80% of them would not be fit to work at a Disney resort! We made our way to the East Lodge only to find vending machines... of poor quality... melted and refroze ice cream filled with ice crystals... no water only soft drinks... Then we walked to see the giraffes near the reservoir just by memory of their location as we missed them during our previous visits and saw everything been boarded up. I asked the staff near the tram stop where were they moved to and to my horror and amusement his response was a simple ""Dead. Dead already"". All in all the animals saved the day of the visit. The fire dancers was entertaining as always and so was the Creatures of the night staff. Please up skill some of your ground staff.

Night Safari,Neil P,A different approach,40,5-Aug-19,"We visited the night safari as a group of 9. We got tickets on line through a 3rd party which worked as quite a bit cheaper. The safari was good fun, the highlight was the tram ride. Below a quick summary.Getting there- difficult, give yourself plenty of time. NS is quite a bit out of town and involves MRT and bus (we went for the safari shuttle which is super confusing about how to pay/whether your MRT is valid etc) in the end the nice driver just let us on. getting home... if you can afford it I would advise taxi, bit ques lots of people, general chaos late at night. Once inside we opted to do the tram ride, it was a big que but it went down quickly, good opportunity to see lots of animal up close. After this you have the opportunity to do some walks which were nice and see some shows, which we didn't see due to time. Overall good experience, well worth doing but be prepared for lots of people.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/10/5f/d3/da/neil-p.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r724824178-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,LeanneCirencester,Animals at night,40,2-Aug-19,It was interesting to see animals at night - not doing a lot to be fair but there was a range of wildlife to see.

Night Safari,mollyQuel,Fun!,40,2-Aug-19,Wasnt sure what to expect if this due to the mixed reviews however I'm glad we went. There was a long wait in the queue for the tram- however it wasn't too hot and the long queue was moving steadily along. We enjoyed the tram ride and saw most of the animals.

Night Safari,BusTravVie,Great tour - lots of waiting,40,31-Jul-19,"The night tour is really a good experience as soon as you are aboard their coaches (although they could think about electrifying those - less noise and smell... - but that is a different topic); nevertheless the waiting time until you are able to board one of the coaches is VERY long, thus reducing the fun of the overall action.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/af/30/df/bustravvie.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r722693922-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,TravelingBbusFun,"As far as zoos go, it's a 4",40,29-Jul-19,"So this is one of the more interesting things to do in Singapore. The lines are long and it is worth paying the $10 for the short line express pass. There is an ok amount of animals, and they put them in areas that that makes it easier to see them. It is however hard to see them.

Night Safari,873jeremyw,Different but still a zoo!,40,15-Jul-19,Got tickets for 8:15 and went straight in to get seats for show at 8:30. (They let you in about 8am). After the show we avoided the tram queue and went and walked the 4 trails (takes about 60-80 mins) and then got on the tram for the tram tour about 10pm. Need to keep in mind that last shuttle from Zoo->Khatib MRT is 10:40pm if you want to use that one. We got tickets for the rainforest Lumina but ran out of time to do this as well this visit. Was a bit of queuing but was worth the trip.

Night Safari,enthusiatictraveller,A bit disappointed,40,12-Jul-19,"I was thrilled when my boyfriend told me that we are going to night safari. I guess I expect too much about it. Honestly speaking, I did not really enjoyed it. But I was happy seeing those animals that are new to me.

Night Safari,harpreets930,Unique and must-do,40,8-Jul-19,"Definitely a very unique experience of combining a safari experience, with the safety of a zoo and the thrill of the night! The tram ride lasts about 45 minutes and takes you through a series of animals including lions, tiger, hyenas, wolfs, multiple types of deers, elephants and rhinos! We were lucky to see almost all of them, except maybe one. The animals are pretty close to you but some have smaller fences around them or a water stream between you and them.There are 2 shows that happen, one fire show outside and another interactive animal show inside. The tricky part with these shows is that they are dependent on the weather. At the slightest of rains they can be cancelled. We were not able to see the shows as it was drizzling when we were there.The safari is very far away from the main part of the city and you will need to dedicate a full evening to do this (a full day if you do the other zoo attractions as well). Also, the price seemed a bit too much keeping in mind that it was more than any other attraction we had gone to in Singapore, except Universal Studios which is a full day attraction! Also, if the shows don't happen, your ticket price still deosn't change.Worth attending for sure but definitely seems expensive!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r702376535-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,Banany73,Busy,40,4-Jul-19,We came with our 2 kids (6 and 12). We bought discounted tickets online the same day and weren't able to pick an entry time until we got up to the zoo at 6.30pm. By then the 7.15pm and 8.15pm entry times were gone so we chose 9.15pm. We hadn't realised at the kiosk that we were selecting entry times and thought it was tour times. When we then tried to enter figuring we'd walk some trails first we were surprised to find out we'd have to wait 2 hours. I think they felt sorry for us and our genuine shock so let us in anyway. There was a huge queue for the tram ride and the show was full so we got a stamp on our hands and came out to get some food. Not the best food but ok. We went back in at 8pm and just got a seat at the creatures of the night show as people had already been queuing and everyone coming off the earlier trans heads straight for the show. The show was ok but nothing great. We did some of the trails and the got the tram at 9ish. By this time there was no queue so if you can wait. Most of the animals are on the right hand side so sit there for best views. We got grab there and back S$22 and S$16. Worth it as it only takes 20 mins and no queuing.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r701280964-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,thejourneysofar,Great place to visit,40,2-Jul-19,We enjoyed our visit. As expected it was busy but this didn't dampen the enjoyment. We caught the Tram first and then walked the whole zoo. Not many people seem to walk it so it lets you linger longer at the enclosures with less people. The animal show was worth seeing as well. Unfortunately some animal feeding only happens on weekends. The only thing we found that was disappointing was the food on offer. Not that enjoyable. That aside it's a must visit.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/14/a6/aa/22/thejourneysofar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r700943122-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

The lobby area is nice and has a sit down restaurant as well as fast food and some gift shops and an ice cream shop.The actual tram loop goes by pretty fast. I think we were only on the tram for about 40-45 mins. The rest of the time we walked 2 of the trails. The trails were good and offered better views of some of the animals.We caught a bit of the fire show at the end just before closing.

Night Safari,He Who Likes Tr... L,"not the usual zoo trip, for sure",40,30-Jun-19,the queue for the tram itself is more arduous than the actual safari. Fast lane people taking their time did not help. Overall it was an enlightening (pun intended) experience-had no idea Singapore had its own elephants!the inability to take flash photography (understandable) meant I had no pictures to take back with me other than the really overpriced photo taken by the staff.

We took direct bus from Suntec city for SG $12 round trip. Arrived before 8pm. We were luckily to jump right on the tram ride. To my surprise, many animals showed up and my teenage boys enjoyed the whole ride. Then we continued to see 9:15 animal show.

Night Safari,aademalde1,Don't count on the animal show unless you like to line up,40,28-Jun-19,"Today my family and I visited the Night Safari. We were very disappointed that both animal shows (8:30 and 9:30pm) were full. We lined up for the first show right after the fire show outside and for the second show at 9:10pm. By that time both shows were full and we left the facilities without having the opportunity of enjoying the shows. I find this very frustrating because it is a non-sense that you pay a ticket, get to the entrance and then need to line-up for at least 45 minutes to get a chance to come into a show. Please take into account that we were there 20 minutes before each of the shows and they were already full.The rest of the experience was very good.

The tour was really good and got very close to a lot of the animals which we didn't expect. It was nice to see so many of the animals so active and there was a great variety.

It is divided into seven geographical zones, which can be explored either on foot via four walking trails, or by tram. The naturalistic enclosures simulate the animals' native habitat. Animals are separated from visitors with natural barriers, rather than caged. Flash photography was strictly not allowed. Cultural performances are a regular feature at the safari, and include tribal dances, blowpipe demonstrations and fire eating displays. Creatures of the Night Show is a performance presented by the animals in the Night Safari.

Night Safari,fabbydabbydozzy,Busy,40,3-Jun-19,"We thought this place was hectic. Everyone clearly arrives at the same time.

Night Safari,Heidicross,It has changed over the years and I preferred it 10 years ago,40,2-Jun-19,"It seems like the Night safari is busy no matter whenever you visit. I have visited many times since its opening and I don't think it's as good as it used to be. The Creatures of the Night show featured lots of animals but the one I saw didn't feature the surprise snake which was a shame. The automated voice now on the tram is a real disappointment because other guests don't respect and listen to it like they used to when it was a human speaking and sharing their knowledge. The walking trails have changed as well and I miss the Bridge of Suspense. The Night Safari is still a great evening out, but some small changes I think have meant it's not as good as it used to be.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/e0/98/43/heidicross.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r692757185-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,Amita P,Singapore Night Safari,40,30-May-19,"Overall an interesting experience. You do get to see a couple of animals, but, the tram moves and it doesn't stop near the enclosures. we just get a glimpse of the animals. Moreover, its dark, hence one has to really focus your eyes. Secondly, enclosures are on both sides of the road , hence we don't get any clear view on the other side .Its an enjoyment trip for kids . So, if not doing anything in the evening, take this night safari. Do wear comfortable clothes . There are eateries there , so you can eat after the trip . They do click your photos with an interesting background and sell it for $20 hardcopy.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r691749304-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,mda97tsc,"Excellent, near perfect",40,29-May-19,"The night safari was excellent. My wife, 4 year old son, 7 year old daughter and I were not disappointed by the animals large and small that were actively walking and eating during our tram ride. Since my kids were rested through the day they could walk the trails to see the other animals like the leopards etc. The only criticism I will give is that the food available outside the park is terribly expensive and of small portions and is a poor reflection on the park. I suggest you look at improving the price, portions and options available.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r688631783-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

This also ment we got dinner before the tram which was OK but we didn't feel too great a few hours after, be wary of the spicy foods. Its a good set up in all, the tram takes you through sections of the park you can't walk through and it's lovely to see animals that you wouldn't in a regular zoo. The tram was also very informative and we got very close to some free roaming animals which was unexpected and lovely to experience. All the animals seem to be well looked after and have relitively good size enclosures from what we could see. The walking bits were also very good, however it did feel a bit crowded at times as some of the pathways were quite narrow and a lot of people were pushing and shoving past.

Later they ask you to take safari which will show all animals on right and left not so close pretty far ... it's a zoo.

Nonetheless, the animals we kept in an open space so that they can move freely, no captive animals, that's the great part of Night Safari.

Night Safari,Ambar_Amit,An Average Zoo Experience,30,12-Apr-20,"Night Safari is over-rated. It was a big crowd around the New Year and it was like quite a mechanical experience. Started by trudging in a queue, being thrown in an open bus/cart, and driven around the park, with pre-recorded audio playing over our heads, looking at shrouded figures of animals and finally being herded back to the exit! Most of the animals looked strangely slow and as if sedated. The views are obscured and dull. The pre-recorded audio guide is unimaginative. To have a pre-recorded guide for a safari was strange in itself. It all looked pretty scripted. Even the show that we wanted to watch got cancelled.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0e/29/73/a7/madhu-ambar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r700831717-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

We then did the walk but rude pushy people aside most animal were either sleeping or trying to get into their areas to sleep.Perhaps it was the time we goit the tram at 8:30pm and walked arounf from about 9:20pm but it was a let down from what the day trip presented.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0e/86/4f/f1/scott-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r700469863-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,ThiBRtravel,Nice experience to see Nocturnal Animals,30,21-Jan-20,"I went on this safari few days ago.This was my first ""Night Safari"", so I don't have anything to compare this to.However, I am going to describe my experience.We went on a week day thinking that there would be less crowd. However, we experienced very long queues.The safari trip was interesting and got the chance to see many nocturnal animals active. This was difference from my past experiences in day time safaris.It is a good thing that the Zoo promotes the environmental conservation.The total ride was about 40 - 45 minutes excluding queuing times and the animal show.After that we went to have the dinner and there was an Indian buffet which was highly overpriced. For the amount they charge, they could at least double the options they offer.Anyway, the food was in acceptable condition.I think this is a good experience to have.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r698229121-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,rkmkdm,Try the Singapore Zoo,30,20-Jan-20,"The Night Safari is not worth 50 SGD if you have ever been on an African Safari. The animals, which may or may not be visible, are mostly viewed from a small tram you are herded onto. They are mostly eating their evening meal or laying about. The demonstration show would be fun for children, but not so much for adults. After doing the above activities and waiting in the long lines we decided not to walk one of the trails so can't tell you if better animal viewing was possible.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r698190343-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,schmidtmg,could be so much better,30,16-Jan-20,"My daughter enjoyed her night safari experience; I had made the experience back in 2007 and enjoyed it much more then. This time we booked online well in advance, for the 9:15 pm entrance. As the trip to the night zoo from downtown takes at least an hour with the MRT and a bus, we arrived very shortly before 9;15 pm. There was a huge queue and we got in around 9:35 pm. There was then another queue for the tram, so we decided to skip that and walk the four well mapped routes through the night zoo. That option is more enjoyable than the tram ride, which is noisy as many tourists (especially Chinese and Indian ones) disregard appeals for quiet. Many of the enclosures are poorly lit so you will have to make a big effort to spot the animals, provided they are night active and pace around their enclosure. Many of them aren't so you won't see them. Can't help feeling that the entire operation has become big business.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r697442225-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,AdaMF3535,Cool but . . .,30,14-Jan-20,"Because the Night Safari at the zoo was recommended to us, we were excited to go, and we did enjoy seeing the zoo & animals at night. The trip (by taxi) took longer than expected, though, and there was a fair amount of waiting in line--but these were managed fairly well. The one thing I really objected to was the exhaust from the car in front of us on the long trolley: the smell made me dizzy. Such emissions aren't good for passengers or animals. In this day & age, the zoo should switch over to solar electric power. There's so much sun in Singapore that the long term should easily cover the initial investment. Every organization (and every person) should do its part to fight climate change.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0f/67/ac/d8/ada-m-f.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r695596143-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,Alethea1984,Great concept but a little disappointing,30,2-Jan-20,This experience had been recommended to us by everyone we know that has visited Singapore and potentially had set our expectstions high.We decided to go on an organised tour due to hearing stories about the mega lines of tourists when going solo. I recommend this as we were guided straight onto the trolley tour.The concept of the night zoo is great but I have to say I was a little disappointed. We didn't see as many animals as I'd expected and the tour only went for 30ish minutes.I probably wouldn't recommend this as a must do for a visit to Singapore.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/77/7a/c7/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r695204811-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,brothermattos,Well designed but...,30,2-Jan-20,"I purchased the tickets online and selected our entrance time. Naively I thought, oh with pre-determined times there must not be a lot of people. Wrong! The queue to the tram was huge. The tour is nice, well put and designed. They do a good job ensuring the animals are visible. There are 2 beginning trails - fishing cat or wallaby. From there you can decide to continue onto other trails or return. The park closed at midnight so we couldn't do it all. There is a creature of the nights show which we watched but I don't recommend. It was a waste of time. Nothing special about it. I wish the trams stopped more so we could take decent pictures. All in all, ok activity to do with the children but make sure you plan it well.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/c5/36/eb/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r694817724-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,rosiedidit,Queues,30,30-Dec-19,"The zoo is quite a long way from the city centre (approximately 30 minutes by taxi) and has more of a theme park feel than most zoos I have visited with no shortage of fast food and lots of retail opportunities.I asked for one adult and one over 60 concession but was told that the concessions were only available to Singapore residents! This is clearly a zoo policy - at other attractions such as The Botanic Gardens, Maritime Museum, Asian Civilisation museum, Indian Heritage museum etc etc we were invited to make use of the concessionary rates.So, after paying $57 each (over ¬£30 each) we were told that the next block entry would be at 8.15pm - a wait if around 2 hours with nothing on offer other than shopping or eating.After queuing at our allotted time we decided to do the walking trails first as the line for the tram was very long. The trails were enjoyable and we got to see a lot of animals in their nocturnal states.We then queued for the tram ( the walking trails do not cover all the enclosures). Quite a long wait made longer by staff bringing several rows of people behind us forward!The tram ride was enjoyable and informative.The zoo says it supports wildlife conservation indeed the tickets tell us that for every $57 ticket sold they donate 50cents to conservation.In summary this is a different experience and one that I enjoyed but the cost, the queues and the theme park feel means I really can't recommend it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r693149269-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,Z S,Nice once you can get in but be prepared!,30,29-Dec-19,"We booked a slot that we thought may be less busy but my goodness the reviews we had read were very accurate!We had an awfully long wait and there was NOWHERE to sit. In the blistering heat we had no choice but to buy drink after drink to stay cool and have something to do in the meantime, which was walk round & round - there is a performance that takes place on the stage near the bar - but I couldn't tell you what it was as you cannot see through the crowds, I assume it was fire breathing or something similar perhaps due to the smell of smoke and spirit.The place is RAMMED. There are simply endless people walking at / around you.The organisation of (or lack of) for entry through a ""flash your ticket"" system is dire and means that people flock to the available staff - usually two - to show their ticket and start queuing. Once you get through this bit you then queue to go through and queue again for the transport. This is chaotic, busy and there is lots of queue jumping. It's highly annoying and terribly organised so be prepared!Having said that, once you are in and on your way, it's actually lovely but again, be prepared for the ignorant tourists who choose to talk so loudly that you can miss the whole audio element of the tour.You need a really good camera for pics and once you start your own tour by foot it is great. We also did the Rainforest Lumina at the end of the night, which was absolutely wonderful and much quieter.Overall, it's fairly well priced but the lack of organisation and facilities was a let down. If you go as a family, with an elderly person or a person who is less able bodied then you will struggle here - before entry particularly.Staff are lovely and most helpful - our phones ran out of power whilst we waited - but just a shame that a lack of organisation can be enough to put you off before you even begin.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ef/9c/default-avatar-2020-14.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r692573333-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,JessicaG6273,Good experience,30,28-Dec-19,"We went on a Thursday night during the Christmas/ new year week. Extremely high people traffic!Night safari in itself was enjoyable. I would give the trams a miss if you have comfy walking shoes and don't mind following trails and map guides.The whole park takes about 1.5 hours.All the animals were out and about.A few pacing animals which were concerning.Creatures Of the night show not too spectacular... the safari itself is more of a highlight.The disappointment was that the show's messages are about reuse reduce recycle: however all the night safari eateries serve their food in single use plastics everywhere!!Seems very tokenistic to say that, I would love to see more action!Super long queues for taxis at the end of the night. We waited 40 mins for a taxi!

Night Safari,459travellove,Felt it was maybe a bit hyped-up,30,24-Nov-19,"We did the 7:15pm after the Singapore Zoo and Boy! was it crowded. There was a performance at the entrance while we were waiting for the gates to open and we did the Creatures of the Night show in the very beginning.. Do try to sit somewhere in the middle and avoid the corner benches if you can, as there are mosquitoes and the trees and shrubs block much of the corner views .. The arena is sprayed with bug killers and I believe Eucalyptus oils too but the corners do not get much coverage. The tram ride that followed soon after had such a maze of a queue and we spent around 30-40 min just moving around in the queues.The ride itself was a bit harrowing as we were quite straining to see the animals against faint lighting and didn't quite enjoy the same except for the lovely night breeze that was incredibly calming... it could also have been early for the night animals at our time and maybe visitors to the park after 9 pm may have had a better experience.Overall felt that the Zoo and the River Safari offered a much better fulfilling experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/1e/8d/5a/459travellove.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r682576946-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,95femkem,Go as late as you can,30,20-Nov-19,"Our first impression wasn't very good. We did the night safari after visiting the Singapore zoo. The zoo closes at 6pm and the night safari only opens at 7.15pm. That leaves you with over an hour to fill with nothing but bad food options. When the night safari opened, the performance at the entrance and the creatures of the night show had been cancelled due to weather conditions (it had been raining slightly all day). So we queued to take the tram around the park. We ended up in a tram filled with very loud, rude and disrespectful people, which totally ruined the experience. After 20 minutes of getting increasingly annoyed, we got off the tram and did the walking trails around the park. This was much nicer and quieter. The park is only dimly lit, so there were a lot animals that we didn't see as it was too dark. You do get a nice feeling of walking in a moonlit park. When we walked all the trails, we went on the tram again. This time there were no queues and only 10 people in the tram. Which made for a very good experience, we could clearly see the animals on both sides of the tram and hear the recording with information on the animals and the park. This was at about 9.45pm. So in my experience it's definitely worth waiting until after 9pm to enter the park. You will still have enough time to see everything.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r679351664-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Most animals were not nocturnal and were either not there, too dark to see them or were asleep. Many we had just seen at the zoo in the day in a much nicer environment.Persisted with the 3 walk trails and again many not nocturnal and many missing or asleep and very dark walk..Disappointed in this and after a hot day at the zoo the tram was that boring I almost fell asleep.

We attended the 7:30 pm session and don't know if the time made a difference to the animals and there interactions with the tour.I would recommend this attraction to people but suggest you search other reviews to see if there is a better time of night to ride the train.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r677597434-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Last transportation bus to MRT leaves at 10 40pm, just all didn't work out. In my opinion it's just far overbooked and we left feeling very disappointed.

Possible to do the safari on foot but with two tired kids, we waited almost an hour in the queue. Tip: go on the tram first and the night creature show after.After having seen a few animal shows (birds of prey in Alsace France, China, Manila) I wasn't impressed. It's a very simple show but I won't spoil the surprise.The actual safari takes about 35 mins, there's no wow factor. Getting to the zoo from downtown then queuing for so long zapped my energy. However for kids it's ok. The souvenir shop is totally generic (I already had a few of the items). SG is expensive so the tickets were also expensive. There's a short fire show that's impressive just after the entrance.Hope you will have a better time than we did.

Night Safari,ThoreWienike,Nice to see animals outside cages - but are they doped and trained?,30,22-Sep-19,"We went to the night safari as kind of spontaneous act, as the city centre is occupied by F1. Besides the fact that it takes a long time to get there, the night safari exceeded our expectations.We unfortunately arrived there rather late, but got to take the tram ride and see many of the animals up close. Next time we will take the walk to have more time at the individual animals. It was very nice to see that there we no actual cages.Next up was the creatures of the night show, and though it was a great show, it still hurts to see ""trained"" wild animals - how do you think they have been trained. My appeal is simple: Stop animal cruelty and let the wild animals be wild.Last but not least we went to the rainforest lumina, which is truely awesome made and had some very funny initiatives.While writing this review I am very torn, as I dispise animal cruelty but could also see that there has been done things to give the animals there space and the rainforest lumina is a must for everyone young and old.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/03/e7/fc/69/facebook-avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r667533726-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

There, we were introduced to nocturnal animals grazing peacefully in their "" natural"" habitat. After that it was too dark to go wander around.

However it was a short trip costing around 46 SGD, not worth the price.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r664793660-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,AtulRane,a different experience,30,4-Sep-19,a Zoo safari...you keep wondering why the animals dont cross their borders...and definitely dont behave as in their natural habitat. Visibility is somewhat poor. Long queues so be prepared to wait.

Night Safari,anniewulan,Short Tram Ride,30,1-Sep-19,"A zoo is place where we could teach our kids what elephants look like, rhinos, flamingos... etc (otherwise it'll be just a place for animal captivity!). Well, night safari is not the right place to do that. At the entrace, we were greeted by lines of gift shops, and then restaurants (is this a mall or something?)Then there's this queue for the tram ride. We didn't queue for a long time since I've read the review and so we arrived there 6.45pm (on Friday).The tram ride is so so.. I feel like duration is too short, too many deer-like animals (my kids even said 'why are we seeing deers again?'ù) and the tram's length itself is too long so that the passangers at the rear end couldn't even see anything!After the tram ride ended, we went to see the night show.... which was also so so. Nothing impressing, animals appeared less than a minute (like they're in rush or something). Owls appeared just once.... sorry, but super boring.And that's it. For 46SGD, tbh it's not worth it. Our journey ended with the night shows, unless you want to walk the trail (in the middle of the night with very small chances to see anything) - no thanks. Better to do something else , just go to river safari or singapore zoo instead.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/b4/39/a3/anniewulan.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r661817334-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

So, the queue for the tram is horrendously long and in a really warm environment. Standing in line was not the major issue, but screaming kids in the quiet habitats of the animals was really bad. There should be a reminder for parents to educate their children to be more considerate.Staffs of the night safari were really helpful, patient and nice!

Night Safari,pamncraig,Give It a Miss,30,21-Aug-19,Firstly the zoo is a LONG bus ride through very heavy traffic only to find that a significant percentage of the population of Singapore is also at the zoo. It was a mob scene. Thank heaven we had priority tram passes and entrance tickets because there was a 1-2 hr wait for admission then another 1-2 hr wait for tram boarding. That being said I would skip the tram ride. It crawls through the exhibits that you could see much better by walking the trails. The exhibits were nicely done but not in the league with say San Diego. Some of the animals were exhibiting confinement stress by pacing back and forth; rather sad. As would be expected it was hot and humid but there was also a smell of petroleum that was very unpleasant. The trams appeared to be electric powered so perhaps it was a mosquito treatment. The concept of nocturnal viewing is interesting but the zoo needs to refine the product and limit the number of tickets sold. If you do go book a tour. The tour guide is entertaining and the priority status a must.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/74/default-avatar-2020-68.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r656874523-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

We had to wait for over 45 minutes to catch the tram which took you around the zoo. When we had finished, the queue was just as long as when we had started. We couldn't wait to get out of the zoo.

Night Safari,helenchapman02,Night safari,30,19-Aug-19,We had a lovely evening but it was totally disorganised. I booked tickets for 6.30pm but when we arrived it was not clear exactly what the tickets were for. There was a show at 6.30pm but also a large queue was forming for the tram. Nobody could really advise us what to do. We opted for the tram ride and waited 40 minutes even though we were members. This was disappointing. The ride was excellent with lots of animals on show. However when it finished we were hoping to go to the show at 7.30pm but it was full. We went on one of the trails and watched the 8.30pm show.I just think it could be so much better organised and more infuriation should be given on what's there to do.

Night Safari was undergoing some form of renovations, during the June/July 2019 period when we visited with overseas friends, probably to make it better.You cannot stop at the East Lodge, on the tram ride, get off, and walk around, to see the giraffes, which were missing, as their enclosure was undergoing upgrading/renovations.Also in the middle island, there used to be a nice swing bridge, but that's gone now, and it's being replaced by waterfall, like we need more artificial waterfalls.Overall, I thought a few additions and upgrades to the park were nice, especially for the tram rides, but for overseas friends, they wanted to take some time to walk the safari, and soak in the nocturnal feeling of it all, which they could not due to the renovations.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/73/3b/52/facebook-avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r653584774-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,christopher s,Very different for a zoo but somewhat disappointing,30,18-Aug-19,"The whole idea of seeing nocturnal animals is a great one but the one problem is you are viewing them at night. In many cases it was difficult seeing the animals because it is dark. We were a group of approximately 40 people and after the walk in the nocturnal area you are offered to go on an a extended walk or go to a show. I think just about all 40 people had enough of the nocturnal animals, possibly because of what said above.The highlight of the evening was a show that they had in an arena with birds and other animals that are well trained to perform. This part should not be missed if you are here with kids. There are many food selections at the zoo with fast food as well as family style sit down eating.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r652007767-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,Pitmans4,Late night and queues,30,16-Aug-19,"Wouldn't describe this as a must do on a Singapore trip.Buy tickets online for sure if you do come otherwise -Queue for ticketsQueue to get inQueue for tramCan quite easily be 20 mins / 30 mins / 45 mins and you haven't seen a thing! Tram trip is ok, but you don't see lots and over in about 25 mins. Queue takes longer than ride. You see more from walking the trails for sure. We did both. Entry tickets are staggered starting at 7.15pm / 8.15pm etc, big needs to change. Once you have entry the tram queue can be massive. If it is when you go don't bother - walk it!Can get there on MRT / bus from city but allow lots of time. Good 40 mins to park from MRT station and then time trip back to avoid missing last MRT (around 11.30pm / 11.45pm). Taxis can be difficult to get hold of at end as everybody leaves at same timeOther things to do instead of this in out opinion - think about it but if you do go be patient and enjoy the queues!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/15/8b/1a/87/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r651441185-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,KunalSingla77,Not as exciting as anticipated,30,13-Aug-19,The tour is done in a open buggy train at night with animals to watch from a distance. While booking the tickets there are time slots mentioned but it's free for all once you reach and there is a huge queue to get to the buggy. Also the queue is in open so it's quite hot and humid. The actual tour duration is less than the time in the queue and there are fewer animals to watch in the night.

Night Safari,Kevin86-bjj,Hard to see animals and need knowledge to enter earlier,30,12-Aug-19,"<Before enter>Although purchased tickets on internet in advance, need to stand in a long queue to collect tickets. Be careful the ticket's condition. Moreover, one counter staff rejected my ticket collect request although I waited for long time in a queue while aligning another staff's indication after my consultation with him. Staff quality depends on each staff, but appreciate if the zoo encourage staffs.There are 4 time-slot to enter Night Safari such as 7:15pm, 8:15pm, 9:15pm and 10:15pm, but earlier time-slots were sold out soon on consecutive holidays. Thus, I could collect tickets for 9:15pm although I arrived at this zoo around 4:30pm.However, there are express pass as multi language tram ticket by S$10. When we have this pass, we can enter the zoo immediately even though I have later ticket. I recommend this way if you accept this cost.<After Enter>Honestly speaking, hard to see animals since they were hiding or lying on the ground and also darkness when I had been walking around the course.But, I could see while I have been riding the tram.My experience which I could see white lions was great for me.We saw a animal shows, and there were cute animals, so we enjoyed......We have been to Singapore Zoo before Night Safari. Singapore Zoo was soooo nice, thus we expected Night Safari is also so good as well.

Night Safari,13happycamper,"Nice well-maintained zoo, very poor queue management",30,6-Aug-19,"I want to give this place a higher rating but they definitely need to improve their queue management. We bought tickets via Klook but it took us almost an hour to enter after they've opened the gates - the queue was very long (our tickets were for the 8:15 PM entry). We were supposed to line up for the tram but after being in line for several minutes and seeing how long the queue was, my husband decided that we should just do the walking trail. This turned out to be a good decision. This allowed us to go around the park and see the animals up close. The zoo seems well maintained and has a good selection of animals - very enjoyable particularly for young kids. We brought a stroller for our 5 year old son, so we were able to move him around quickly when he would tire from walking. While we enjoyed the walking trail, I was also concerned during this time if we will be able to catch the tram and see the show before the night was over. After going around for almost an hour to complete the walking trail, we were able to line up fairly quickly for the tram ride. At this time though, we had already missed the creatures of the night show (930 PM show) and the park was nearing closing time (already past 10 PM). From our experience, if you enter at 815 PM, you will not be able to see all the attractions - in our case, we just did the walking trail and tram but missed the show. The zoo needs to manage their queues better, maybe limit the tickets sold so their guests can still get a good solid experience and not feel like they need to be rushing to cover the entire place and enjoy all the attractions. Or maybe they can also adjust the timings so the park closes at a slightly later time and people can enjoy the place better. In terms of customer service, I didn't find the attendants very friendly, some were unsmiling or curt when you ask them questions. Suggest better training for them as well - they are part of the experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/a5/db/02/13happycamper.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r649426105-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,WiseTreeOwl,"A good zoo but over hyped, not worth the queuing.",30,4-Aug-19,"Our expectations were very high for the Night Safari, we had been told by travel agents back home what a unique experience it was and many of the reviews on here really hype it up too.We found the experience to be quite different in reality.Firstly if you have booked online tickets you need to queue when you arrive to collect these tickets, this was over 20 minutes of queuing for us.We were then advised to start queuing for the entrance which I was surprised by as we had timed entrance tickets, so we queued for another 30 minutes to get in.Once we were in we queued for nearly an hour to get onto the train that takes you around to see the animals.So that was nearly 2 hours stood queuing before we saw any animals. We did have the opportunity to walk around parts first, but the trains stop at a certain time and there were so many people there that we were concerned that we would not get a ride on the train.The ride was shorter than I expected and we found after that you get a better chance to view the animals by walking around. A lot of the animals, lions, tigers, elephants etc you do see in most zoos in the days time, but there are some when you are walking around such as the sugar gliders that you don't.When leaving we found that there was a massive queue for the taxis and it was impossible to get a grab taxi to pick is up, but getting a bus a little way from the zoo and getting off we were easiily able to get a grab taxi to pick us up.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0a/e9/06/8e/cheltenhamchappie.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r648411134-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Also there is the hour and a half return trip from town to the zoo. I would recommend if you don't mind queuing but otherwise forget it.

When we arrived, there weren't any staff to show where the line started, and were wandering around the entrance for about 10 minutes.We waited in the line for an hour and a half. The line was long because they mixed both 7pm and 8pm groups. When that was done, we went to another line for another hour. By the time we got inside the tour car, we were already tired, and sweating.That being said, the attractions and animals we saw were amazing and I was able to see new animals I'd never seen before.I hope to be back as soon as the problem is fixed.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r645080993-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,Sian W,Ok but so so busy,30,9-Jul-19,"So when I bought the tickets online as part of the 4 parks in 1 deal I chose a time slot. Little did I know the the rest of Singapore would be in at that time aswell !!!It was so busy it was quite overwhelming. We headed to the night show creatures of the night.. which is cute. But really we should have gone for a walk around first (which I recommend), then head to the show (8.30) then tram ride.We did show then stood in the tram queue for an hour and still hadn't got on. So decided to walk... but you don't see everything on the walk so need to do both! When we got back the queues were smaller.Nice to see Animals at night but this has a real zoo feeling and money making .. just mobbed with people.the leopards are in a tiny area and we're pacing back and forth and looked really sad. People were banging on windows and shouting loudly. But no staff around the trails to keep an eye out.We headed to the Illumination rainforest walk after this in the zoo part which we absolutely loved !",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r644047710-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,AnnaLisa764,Nice tour but long waiting time,30,4-Jul-19,"The night Safari itself is amazing. It takes 32 minutes, not 40min. The tour is highly recommend, but the waiting time NOT. We didn't expect such a long queue. We booked the safari on a Wednesday at 8.15pm. After the entry was a very long queue for the tram ride. We waited for 45 minutes. This is even longer then the tram ride. You can also walk through the zoo by night. You have 4 walking trails, each takes about 20 minutes. Last entry is at 10.15pm and at 11.45pm they start to kick you out because the zoo closes at midnight.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1c/03/1e/62/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r641859721-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,KapilKotak,Little Over Rated,30,27-Jun-19,We recently visited the Night Safari . If you imagine Safari to be like Nepal or South Africa then just stop dreaming . It's a zoo Maintained nicely for the inside tour in Tram to watch the animals having their food . The food timings are Maintained such that all the animals can be visible . The quantity of the animals is not huge . Some countable in small numbers each breed .We had an iternary of Night Safari after checking out from the Universal Studio .I would suggest '' This is not at all Must Visit Place'' Compared to Thailand Zoo this place needs lots of improvement .You can visit if you have spare time in the evening . Otherwise no need to leave from the Universal Studio early in the evening .Travel agents have convenient pickup and drop accordingly so they would set this iternary but it's ok if not visited .The light show in the beginning and the night life animals show in the last was nice to watch . Full marks to them .One good thing ... they allow outside food with you .Tram ride has all the time waiting of 30-40 minutes so keep patience . No need to hurry . All the times mostly same waiting is there .Hope it's helpful .Thanks,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/eb/c9/5b/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r640008804-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,CindersS25,Average,30,18-Jun-19,"Our group of 7 attended the night safari. With plenty of food options available we all had Dinner before our 8.15pm entry. The fire show just before entry was very good and entertaining. After finally entering the zoo we decided to walk around the zoo for a while before jumping on the bus tour as the wait was 45minutes long!! We headed back to the bus after a while when the line was still 35mins long. As the wait was so long we missed a couple of shows. The bus tour was really very good and the highlight was passing the wolf enclosure to have them howling to our hearts content!! After the bus tour we finished up with the night encounter show which was o.k. I'm only giving the night safari 3 stars because there were too many people which meant waiting times were too long and therefore not possible to attend everything on offer. I must disclose that we went during Singapore School Holidays, but a cutoff should still be applied in my opinion.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/37/9b/85/cinderss25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r633881916-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,Uktraveller492,Interesting but very busy,30,16-Jun-19,There are two parts to this activity - a ride that takes you round enclosures and then the opportunity to walk on paths taking you past other animals. If you can it's worth getting priority boarding for the tram ride as it lets you skip the queues which can be very long. The tram does not stop so you don't have the opportunity to stop and observe those animals and the continual movement makes any photography in dark conditions impractical. Having said that there is a fair chance of seeing some great animals like tapir fairly close up. Just ditch the camera for this part. More interesting are the paths where you can take your time and watch the animals. The high point for me was going into a large enclosure and seeing fruit bats just inches away - with no glass or barrier - eating and active. If you want to observe the animals at leisure the paths are less crowded and much more interesting than the 'safari'ù ride.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r633714808-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,cl41r3,A little bit boring for a solo traveller,30,15-Jun-19,I was originally visiting with a friend but plans changed so I ventured alone.Being a solo visitor I was directed to take the walk and not access the vehicle that drives around the zoo. This means there is an area that's not accessible.Although the walk was pleasant and not so crowded. Many of the viewing areas were too dark to see the animals.I would recommend to families as lots of children there seemed to be loving it.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/ed/10/3c/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r632110674-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,Starr5,Great to see the animals,30,12-Jun-19,"I found the night Safari a little confusing.I had to ask for a map when I got my ticket and glad I did.When you enter you get out on a train for a tour around the gardens. I feel like the right side get most of the higher profile animals.When that is over, we arrived to hear the 8.30 night creature show was full, which meant I could not see the show, due to my departure time.There are two walks that they refer to but what you don't realise is you can walk behind those areas. I'm glad I found out (although a little late as I had wandered slowly in first area).

Night Safari,601cheryle,Too busy,30,10-Jun-19,Night Safari was good but its too busy. Dont do it with a tour group as you dont get long enough to do any of the walks. It would have been great a few years ago but now there are just too many people and the queues are unbelievable. Theres not much seating unless you are in one of the restaurants. We did a combined tour of River and Night Safari but they dont tell you that you have a couple of hours to kill between safaris where there is nothing to do but sit in the heat.

Night Safari,meinschatz225,A NIGHT TO REMEMBER,30,3-May-19,"If you're looking for a thrilling adventure, then you should visit this place. The Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Singapore. It is divided into seven geographical zones, which can be explored either on foot via four walking trails, or by tram.THE GOOD PART:Up close and personal with the wild animals like lions, we actually saw giraffes, monkeys, zebras, and tigers almost a 100 meters away from our tram. But we are not allowed to touch or be near them even if the other animals come near us.THE BAD PART:Before we rode the tram we were told not to do flash photography or make inappropriate noise. The wild animals might be disturbed if they hear us if we make some noise, and prowl unto us. I was so scared and nervous the whole time during the ride, because the other guests inside the tram doesn't follow what the instructor told us to do.They were talking so loud and calling the animals by whistle.It was a fright night for me, an unforgettable experience Indeed!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/16/1a/d8/69/meinschatz225.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r614370974-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,lilcorm,Disappointed,30,1-May-19,"Great and well-maintained site, fun tram with a nice proximity with the animals, but still you do not see the animals that much in the evening, some are sleeping or hidden in the dark. The major negative point is that you're paying for waiting in lines. It took almost one hour to get in the tramway. And even when it's finished, you still need to wait in lines to take a taxi or bus, about 30min of waiting.Also the taxi to get there doesn't cost 15-20$, as I heard and read everywhere. It cost us 30$ to get there and 45$ to get back (same place).

The tram ride was decent and it gave us glimpse of some of the rare nocturnal creatures.We saw the tribal dance performances, blowpipe demonstrations and fire eating displays. They were quite good. The best one was Creatures of the Night Show where there was a performance presented by the animals in the Night Safari.There are a few food outlets in the Night Safari like Ulu Ulu Safari Restaurant, Casa Italia, Bongo Burgers, etc. One can also dine in the ""Evening in the Wild"" at Night Safari's only Tepee tent.

Night Safari,Gints K,Good ride and not so much to see,30,25-Mar-19,"This is good way how to finsh zoo day after visiting main zoo and river safari, but not worth to pay extra or visit only alone. This was the most haotic park and least organized - people must wait around one hour before opening and when thay open then they start fire performance which you can not see but must stand ir another queue while they deside to allow people get in arena where some kind of show later is performed (weak). After show you get a ride along park - oportunity to see animals, but if you spent already whole day in zoo then this will not impress. No flash so pictures will not be good as during day.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/07/87/fd/a0/gints-k.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r735694578-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,indianlil,This part of the Zoo which shows off its animals at night was not one that is nothing with nothing event!,30,24-Mar-19,Large crowds all shuffling around and queuing to get onto the trams that go round for 45 mins. Animals are obviously fed and therefore have no need to go hunting for food.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/99/default-avatar-2020-57.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r735288017-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,CarolABooth,Interesting but possibly over rated,30,21-Mar-19,"I was rather disappointed with this visit, given the glossy advertising. The information regarding how the train system worked was not clear until we got there. We ended up doing the walk around the zoo first, but had to get all the way back to the start to get the tram/train, whereas we'd have preferred to have had a rest and been able to get on part way. I was also concerned about the limited space that the animals had - to ensure they would be ""in the spot light"" for tourists.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r735182112-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,DavidR11759,A Bit Disappointing,30,19-Mar-19,"I preface this by saying I have been to some truly impressive wildlife parks and shows so perhaps I've been spoiled. But, my overall impression of the Night Safari is....meh!The park itself is out of Singapore proper, but a Grabcar was only $18 to get there from downtown and a taxi back was about $25. $48 for park entrance seemed high. The park reminded me a little of a Disney park - very crowded, bad overpriced food and a bit hokey. It just seemed more like an amusement park than a wildlife or nature park. Included with admission was the Creatures of the Night Show. Lame. A good portion of the audience left half way through. I think there were 5 creatures that they managed to stretch out for what seemed like an hour. Simply overplayed, not particularly informative. The 'audience interaction'ù was painful. Also included was a tram ride through the park. Again, my beef is that many of the animals are the same as you would see during the daytime. The problem is that , obviously it is dark, and many were out of site despite the also-painful canned narration that would describe them whether they were there or not. Most of the enclosures were lighted, so if you could see them, it was the same as viewing them in the daytime just a bit harder to make out. They were not active. You can also walk through the park which at least gives you adequate time at each enclosure, but again, nothing I would say that was extraordinary or noteworthy. At least there were not a lot of biting bugs. If you've never been to a zoo, or had little experience with nature parks, maybe this would be interesting for you. If you frequent such places, don't bother adding this to your list.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/12/5d/54/ab/david-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r735135864-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,Julie F,Bit disappointed,30,16-Mar-19,We were so looking forward to the safari having had great feedback from friends who had done it. Unfortunately we left a little disappointed. We had taken time to have camera set up to take photos (without flash) but tram moved far too quickly to capture a lot of the animals...we also had no help when tram ride finished to guide us to the walking areas on the site..instead we were just left at food court area and exit.Day trip to the zoo would have been better ....,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r734391238-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,bobl864,"OK, but maybe overrated",30,15-Mar-19,The night safari tram does take you past a number of habitats but the animals for several are not where they can be seen and others may be difficult to see well in the low light.

Night Safari,Escape42520080706,It's a bit of a gimmick and you cannot see much anyway,30,14-Mar-19,"I can appreciate that some animals are more active at night and would thus be better observed at night, but the problems are 1) A human cannot see that well at night and coupled with the zoo's (correct) use of less intense lights, even less is visible; 2) Photos don't turn out that well; 3) There are more mosquitoes than during the day; 4) It is more humid at night(?); 5) It is relatively more inconvenient to get there in the evenings; and 6) You can fall asleep due to the lateness of the activity. I would advise visitors to just go to the Singapore Zoo and skip the Night Safari, or skip all of those shows and secure the earliest trams to be able to see the animals before it is truly dark. I would advise the zoo to concentrate on animals that are only active at night (hence, not elephants), including marine life, thus making this zoo truly unique and worthwhile for visitors.

Most seats had restricted vision and it was just not good.We then went on to the train ride, which was the best bit. It lasted around 40min (so did the queue for it, however it did move very quickly, they are soooo efficient!) we then embarked on the walk...which was OK but the boys wanted to see the lion fern and tiger feed and we really struggled to follow the signs as they weren't very well sign posted and not many rangers on site to ask for directions :( so we ended up missing both so boys were disappointed.We didn't try the food there because we were rushing to get to the transport back to city as it is about an hour away.Final note?

On the tram rides, there was no social distancing. Everyone was at most 0.5m away from each other. Hand-sanitiser Dispensers are placed at the exits, and none were placed at the entrance.

Night Safari,Serial_Traveller,A Complete Rip-Off. Cheated.,20,15-Jan-20,"After dealing with various situations in Singapore where people were so honest about correcting their mistakes, it came as a shock to feel so cheated by the ridiculous Night Safari Singapore.If you really must go, then add it on to an afternoon trip to the zoo. But it would be a waste of money to do the Night Safari by itself. It's going to take you around half an hour to get there by taxi, and the taxi will cost around SGD 25, and then back again to your hotel.Hundreds, if not thousands of people arrive for the 7.15 ... and then again for the 8.15 entrance, and so on. Fortunately the queues move fast, and the staff get you on the trams quickly.You would think as dusk fell you would get a reasonable view of the animals. But you don't. Most the the animals you will see will be various deer and hogs. Let's be honest, what people really want to see is lions, tigers and magnificent beasts. Does anyone care about seeing hogs in the dark ?Many of the animals have dark fur .. so what you might get to see is some white or pink in their ears, and that's about it. Other impressive animals like the elephants, you can see them a whole lot better in daylight. So there's no point looking at them at night.We were also told the tram ride was around 45 minutes. It was over in 30 minutes.They save the best for last. A tiger, properly lit, in a small enclosure so it paces back and forth behind glass. Not entirely sure that's one happy tiger. And that's it, that is your highlight right at the end, the last 5 to 8 seconds.Also, irritatingly there's a horrible recorded American cheesy narration. They constantly ask people to be quiet to not scare the animals, but the Chinese and Indians don't listen or understand and jabber the whole trip, so ruin any atmosphere. Would have loved to have fed some of them to the lions.I also have my doubts about some of the animals in the main zoo. The beautiful leopards and cheetahs constantly pace back and forth in a very small space.

Night Safari,F6852IOgustavog,Felt like a waste of time,20,9-Jan-20,"There's one thing that's important to understand: the night safari is a ""tram ride"" through the zoo... at night. Not really a safari. Although we did ride pretty near one or two animals, we saw most of them from the same distance as you'd see them if you just visited the zoo during the day. The fact that it's a ""night"" safari means you don't see the animals so well, as it is dark. Getting there is a bit of a hassle as it's not near a metro station, so you need a bus, and there were MASSES of people. We spent for more time getting there and queuing up than looking at the animals. Visiting the zoo during the day would have been a better experience, but in hindsight we should have skipped it altogether.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/15/de/f4/b5/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r636459136-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

Night Safari,chwaa1,Expensive for a ride in the dark,20,1-Jan-20,"With so many great reviews we followed the masses of people in Dec 2019 to see animals at night. There was about 20mins wait in line to buy tickets. There was about 40mins wait in line to get into the night safari. There was then another 35min wait in a zig zag line to get a tram ride to see some animals in their enclosures. We would have liked to go around again but weren't willing to join the line again. For over $200+ for a family of 5, I don't think it was worth it. They let too many people in the zoo even though there are set entrance times. There are still people there from the earlier entrance time.Great place to see some animals and lots of people queuing.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r635372394-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,OzJohnno,Not Worth the Money,20,12-Dec-19,"As a part of the Park Hopper package we went off to see the Night Safari at the Zoo complex. Our entry time was 7.15pm and we arrived, by tax at around 6.30 and joined the queue. Whilst there appeared to be many taking part on the night it was only on a couple of occasions that we felt pushed out of the way.We were somewhat disappointed with the Night Safari for a number of reasons. The tram trip to see the ""nocturnal"" animals was average at best. The recorded commentary didn't always reflect what we were supposed to be seeing and the animals we did see, with the occasional exception, were not interesting. We did the tram trip twice, once at the beginning and once much later in the evening, but there was no difference in the experience.The Creatures of the night show was, pathetic. According to the blurb this was ""one of the world's finest animal shows"". In fact it was 15 mins of mainly talk and the occasional animal walked through the stage. That was it. The night walking trails were not bad but just because an animal is nocturnal doesn't mean it is sitting there waiting for you to come by. The food. though a tad expensive, was good and the staff were exceptional. They were always smiling and interacted with everyone answering all the usual questions.To sum up IMO the Night Safari is not worth the time, effort or cost to attend.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/4a/28/0d/ozjohnno.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r635146442-Night_Safari-Singapore.html

It's short, and the animals are barely visible in the low light. Not all animals were nocturnal, eg lions.The walks sounded good, but the way our visit was structured, we only had time to walk for five minutes.Advice?

Night Safari,Nicky L,Very overcrowded and difficult to see animals,20,17-Sep-19,"I booked on a tour to get skip the line tickets for the tram as i had read many reviews that standing in the line if doing it yourself can be along time. The tour was well organised but was extremely rushed. the tram ride was nice and relaxing but not many animals to see and of course poor lighting as this is a night zoo. After the tram you can see the shows, one is fire dancing and an animal show which is about conservation more than a show about the animals. To walk around the zoo at night, tracks can be misleading and paths uneven in poor light. I personally would skip this attraction.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r623398907-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,Paul_L_Donno,Disappointed,20,15-Sep-19,Because our daughter is in a wheelchair we were advised to get a guide and at ¬£150 each for the night safari it was not worth the money. The sound track for the guided trip through the zoo was out of sync so we were told about the animals once we had passed them. When you are looking at a Lion and being told about an elephant it is a bit annoying. Our cart broke down which was a major thing for the staff and no one really knowing what was going on. The fire show was good and the animal show ok.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/b5/48/76/paul-l-donno.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r622636321-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,misterBigP,To much waiting and therefore to little to see,20,4-Sep-19,"If you like us, just, visit the nightzoo without making an reservation for what time you may enter the zoo, you can wait more than and and a half hours before entering. I never had the feeling I'm in a zoo, more I'm at Disney or some other parc. Everywhere ques. Everywhere fastfood and everywhere you were spoken too like you are a kid in Disney. TERRIBLE. About ten years before we visited the Zoo and then it was great. Now it was one big dissapointing.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r620580479-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,YJacklin,Expect to queue!,20,1-Sep-19,"Expect to queue if you make the trip here. We arrived early for the first timed admission at 7.15 but didn't get on the tram until an hour later! The experience was a bit different fro. A daytime visit to the zoo, the animals all appeared on queue and I couldn't help but think that they were somehow being kept in place! At the end of the tram ride there was a show but the next show was fully booked so we would have had to wait for another hour so didn't bother. It's a long trip out from the centre by MRT and then Bus.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/c5/40/60/yjacklin.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r620525323-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,Trevor Y,Good idea gone badly wrong,20,30-Aug-19,"(no subject)TTrevorto me4 minutes agoDetailsLet me start by saying I love animals and enjoyed a day at the Singapore Zoo - not so the Night Safari.Like a lot of good ideas, this one appears to have been hijacked by greed for inordinate profit.Was it a peaceful, engaging, educational experience? NO Was it more like a crowded shopping mall? YES. Was it worth the money? NOHaving read reviews about long queues, we arrived at 6:30 for 7:15 time slot (bought on line). As you enter the park, the music blaring and shops give you the idea you are entering a ""Gold Coast"" style theme park, not a place to quietly encounter animals. By chance we were ushered to a new queue so were able to get on the first tram at 7:05 but I noted lots of people waited heaps longer. The tram ride was ineffective - instead of the driver having the ability to stop and spend time where the animals are visible, he is forced to keep going to fit in with the tacky pre-recorded commentary- why? Because just behind is another packed tram'¶..and another one'¶..(Note the tram commentary is not live as stated on the official website)I had hoped walking the trails might be moe enjoyable, but alas'¶.many of the enclosures are very small and lots of the animals appear bored or distressed. The most distressing species however was the humans - the park seems to be packed with people racing around (mostly with screaming kids) noisily calling to each other when they spot an animal, taking photos with their phones (I wonder how many of them turned out in the dark) and then racing off after a few seconds. I found myself telling a few people to be quiet and turn off their camera flashes, because no one else was. In fact some of the tour guides were the worst offenders. In the end I gave up. By the time we had fought the crowds back to the Creatures of the Night section it was full, so I can't comment on that.As I left, I read a notice that the park welcomes 1.3 million visitors a year, but I am not sure that is an achievement to boast about. The only way I can see this place improving is if visitor numbers are restricted and staff are visible and willing to regulate people's behaviour. In the mean time don't waste your money. Spend it at the mall instead - at least you will come home with something.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/b8/default-avatar-2020-22.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r620380558-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,The2vMartins,Ok if you've never been to a zoo!,20,27-Aug-19,Really don't understand the amazing reviews. It's a zoo that you take a tram ride around at night. Horrendous queues to board the tram even with a booked slot. Kids were boiling and restless while we waited an hour after our 8.15pm booking just to board the tram. Ride took about 45 minutes so less time than the actual queue!! Yes you see some lovely animals but the tram keeps moving so you've gotta make the most of that 10 seconds you get to see it! Some enclosures are either empty or the animals are cleverly disguised as trees! I'm sure it's fun if you've never visited a zoo before!!,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/63/avatar041.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r615242993-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
Night Safari,annbK5260LE,One for kids,20,24-Aug-19,Had high expectations as had heard great things about night safari. Definitely would recommend booking a tour with priority boarding for tram as queue looked horrendous. The tram does not stop in front of animal enclosures so very hard to get photos. We were lucky enough to have front seat of tram so guide was whispering explanations to us. All in all think children would enjoy this but we were all very underwhelmed for price we paid.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ea/2e/default-avatar-2020-67.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324761-r614720958-Night_Safari-Singapore.html
