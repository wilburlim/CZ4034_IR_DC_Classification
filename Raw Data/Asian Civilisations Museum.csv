Asian Civilisations Museum,shinf2016,Worth Visiting,50,43841,"We came here on 2 January. We were not sure if the museum was open or not. But open! First we entered the wrecked ship part. It was really interesting to know the sea lane to link the east and west even hundreds of years ago. At he same time we could get chances to know Asian civilization. Though this may not be regarded as the spot for tourists, I believe worth visiting for tourists as well. In addition we got kind guidance from a volunteer although she was off officially.

Asian Civilisations Museum,NYKGMGTGSG,Another amazing museum in Singapore!,50,43826,"I've noticed that the museums in Singapore are housed in historical staid colonial style government buildings that provide utter surprise when you visit. The National Gallery, National Museum and the Asian Civilisations Museum, we visited on three afternoons and each one provided us with wonderful exposure to cultural and historical treasures. Though we had a scant 1.5 hours at the ACM, we spent time visiting the Shipwreck which was on display in NYC several years ago.

Asian Civilisations Museum,Stephen U,"The ""must see"" museum",50,43814,"This is what you could call a 'proper'ù museum: full of fascinating objects, arranged to tell stories, intelligently displayed in context and properly captioned and designed to illuminate and educate rather than 'entertain;'ù though, by illuminating and educating, it also entertains. One could tag on to a free guided tour or just go where the flow takes one. Subjects covered included the development of religions in the area and the history of Singapore and surrounding area in the time before Raffles turned up.The artefacts from the Tang Dynasty shipwreck were impressive by their numbers and quality. The shipwreck was not exactly in Singapore's waters but showed the extent of the trade that came through the area back in the day. The Scholars gallery, devoted to the Chinese ideal of 'the Scholar'ù showed items of exquisite quality. We visited at the time of the 'Living with Ink'ù exhibition which displayed a superb collection of Chinese scripts and paintings.We spent an afternoon there and should have found time for a return visit, but didn't.

Asian Civilisations Museum,dheersanghi13,Asian Civilisation Museum - The Raffles Exhibit and the Tang Shipwreck,50,43574,"The Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM), located near Clarke Quay, is dedicated to exploring the rich artistic heritage of Asia and gives great insight into life before the 20th century. It highlights Singapore's history as a port city and provides informative exhibits that will change your perspective of people, places, and processes. I did 2 different tours of the ACM. The first one was about Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and his time in Java, and the second was about the Tang Shipwreck.Sir Stamford Raffles is known as the founder of Singapore. There are schools, roads, and various monuments named after him. But who was he really? According to our volunteer docent, 'Raffles is a man of many monikers; scholar, scoundrel, administrator, plagiarizer, reformer, statesman.'ù This tour gives a peek into the life of Raffles from different perspectives. It details his thoughts, feelings, and mindset through his collection of art. Most Singaporeans remember Raffles due to his brief 10-month stay in Singapore but in reality, he rose to prominence during his residence is Java, Indonesia. The story of this man has been interpreted and misinterpreted hundreds of times. This tour also described the great empires of Java and the intricate relationship between Britain and its colonies. Additionally, displayed at the museum are several collections of art, trinkets, masks, puppets, gamelan ensemble, and more by Raffles. As a Singaporean Resident, this tour gave me a new understanding of the man who is so cherished by locals and foreigners alike.In 1998, a shipwreck discovered near Sumatra islands, south of Singapore, was found to contain a remarkable cargo of ceramics, gold and silver objects. The story started about 1100 years ago, during the time of the Tang dynasty in China. Trade was flourishing between China, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The objects recovered show us the strong demand for rare objects, and the artistic skills possessed by craftsmen back then. This gallery, with its stunning artifacts and displays, tells a story of lost civilizations.There were also some interesting quotes by the guides at the museum:'Raffles is a man of many monikers; scholar, scoundrel, administrator, plagiarizer, reformer, statesman.'ù'The Tang Shipwreck helps us understand arguably the most important period of human history, the time of the trade.'ù",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310896-r667511904-Asian_Civilisations_Museum-Singapore.html

I felt the curators invested a lot of effort in the design and selection of the exhibits and it contributed to a great viewing experience.Admission was $20SGD with discounts for those over 60, students and children. I was given a sticker to wear which showed security I was paying guest.I joined one of the hourly guided tours which covered an overview of the museum but other tours specialized in specific topics. The original intent of the building was to be a courthouse but was mostly left vacant or used as a warehouse until it was repurposed as this museum.On the first floor we were introduced to a Tang Dynasty era shipwreck found in off an island in Indonesia that was full of well preserved ceramics and a small cache of gold and silver. In the rooms next door we explored the different styles of ceramics with Asian themes from around the world. A small cafe was also located by the rear entrance.On the second floor we walked through displays about religions in Asia, Islamic and Christian Art, cultural artifacts dealing with rituals and a retrospective on Stamford Raffles. The third floor contained one room with musical instruments laid out in front of a mock up of a local home and the others contained more contemporary artwork or ceramics.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0c/cd/31/6c/wireless-in-ca.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310896-r655938818-Asian_Civilisations_Museum-Singapore.html

Asian Civilisations Museum,Christine_B-77584,Very nice museum,40,43620,"I learned a lot during my visit.What I liked the most: 1. The lighting is very well done; at the same time dim enough to be comfortable but focused in the correct locations so that the pieces are put forward. 2, The building is pretty both on the inside and the outside and the rooms are very spacious. 3, There is ample space between pieces and very clear written descriptions. 4, The museum has benches to sit on in most rooms, which is very appreciated during a long visit.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because there is no clear traveling direction. I understand that this may be difficult to plan in such a building but we ended up going into dead-ends and retracing or steps multiple times. But that is a very minor negative. I highly recommend this museum!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/63/8a/10/christine-b-77584.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310896-r678635628-Asian_Civilisations_Museum-Singapore.html

The trade room had paintings depicting scenes of early trade days along with some very good pottery from different places. The religious diety exhibit is core Asian religion. Everything is marked well. I recommend the free highlight tour before or after you stroll around for what should be a total of 90 minutes.

We did argue a little with the front desk, but they were adamant that we did not qualify for the discount.

Yes, due to renovations the current exhibit is somewhat small, though certainly enough to engage and delight the viewer for an hour or more. I will acknowledge that when I visited several years ago they displayed a much broader collection of regional art whereas the current display focuses primarily on Buddhist and Hindu art. Yes, there are certainly better and more extensive collections in other major world cities, but if you're in Singapore this is the place to go for some quiet contemplation away from the heat and humidity. There are a number of marvelous and unusual pieces here, especially of Buddhist art from the 2nd century on. If patrons want more detailed explanation and contextualization, they can read a book, I go to appreciate the art of religious expression not to get a history lesson. I would add that, while it will not blow you away with beauty, the artifacts in the Tang Shipwreck display do cause one to ponder the incredible extent of trade in the region more than 1000 years ago.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310896-r554036390-Asian_Civilisations_Museum-Singapore.html

Asian Civilisations Museum,AyushBasu,(Min) 2 hours are recommended for this place!,50,43879,"The Asian Civilisations Museum is meant to showcase the rich art and culture of not only Singapore, but also the SE Asian region. The building itself is lovely and has a strong presence, even though tranquil. The Khoo Teck Puat Gallery is an exhibit for the cargo recovered from the Tang Shipwreck, a sunken 9th century trading ship and gives an excellent overview of porcelain and other ceramics. Upstairs galleries house religious statues and idols of worship. This place is easily accessible from Raffles Place and City Hall MRT Stations. The permanent galleries are free for citizens and permanent residents. I would recommend a minimum of two hours here!

Asian Civilisations Museum,Jim_atl,Interesting Museum,40,43875,I spent a couple of hours exploring this museum. You start with what was found in the ship wreck. It was interesting to see how many items they packed on the ship and how they packed them to maximize the quantity. The rest of the museum has interesting galleries with good explanations of the objects.

Asian Civilisations Museum,Malbena,Ceramics are not my thing,30,43873,"I went to the Tang Shipwreck with high expectations, unfortunately I was disappointed. The exhibition consists almost entirely of pottery. There was no remnants of the boat itself. In other similar museum exhibits e.g. Mary Rose in Portsmouth, the highlights have been the everyday items of the crew. None of these items were recovered with this shipwreck, probably because the crew lived on the deck.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/e1/89/a0/malbena.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310896-r302691176-Asian_Civilisations_Museum-Singapore.html

Asian Civilisations Museum,Robyn O,Fabulous specialised exhibitions,50,43861,Whenever I am going to Singapore I always check to see if there are any new exhibitions at this museum. I have seen several very interesting and varied exhibitions over the last year. I am never disappointed when visiting here. The Asian anthropological exhibits and the Tang Shipwreck are also very interesting. I can spend hours here looking and the wide range of artefacts available. It is definitely worth visiting and is a very short walk from Raffles MRT Station. I have also had lunch here several times as well.

Asian Civilisations Museum,shinf2016,Worth Visiting,50,43841,"We came here on 2 January. We were not sure if the museum was open or not. But open! First we entered the wrecked ship part. It was really interesting to know the sea lane to link the east and west even hundreds of years ago. At he same time we could get chances to know Asian civilization. Though this may not be regarded as the spot for tourists, I believe worth visiting for tourists as well. In addition we got kind guidance from a volunteer although she was off officially. It was really kind of her.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310896-r134887866-Asian_Civilisations_Museum-Singapore.html
Asian Civilisations Museum,Gillian L,Well laid out museum with good variety of exhibitions,50,43839,We loved this museum because of our private interest in early pottery & porcelain so we thought the Tang Shipwreck exhibition was superb.

Asian Civilisations Museum,NYKGMGTGSG,Another amazing museum in Singapore!,50,43826,"I've noticed that the museums in Singapore are housed in historical staid colonial style government buildings that provide utter surprise when you visit. The National Gallery, National Museum and the Asian Civilisations Museum, we visited on three afternoons and each one provided us with wonderful exposure to cultural and historical treasures. Though we had a scant 1.5 hours at the ACM, we spent time visiting the Shipwreck which was on display in NYC several years ago. Here we saw the full exhibit and I would easily go back to just spend more time in these galleries. The heart and the soul of the museum is the Works of Ink, a private collection that is among the best collections in the world, maybe outside of China.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/51/cf/11/nykgmgtgsg.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d310896-r358351676-Asian_Civilisations_Museum-Singapore.html
