Singapore Zoo,HerrSuman,Amazing Zoo,50,8-Mar-21,"I love this place because of the way animals are kept, they look healthy and relatively happier than any other zoo I have seen, allowing them to live is relatively closer to their native living place and not like a cageMust visit place in Singapore",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/d6/c8/e3/herrsuman.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r784151723-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,KYHENG,Best zoo I have ever been,50,8-Mar-21,"Haven't been here for years and after visiting several zoos around the region, must say that this is the best zoo I have even been to.The absence of cage and well designed moat around most enclosures allows us with unobstructed view of the animals in their natural habitat, albeit man made. The animals looked comfortable and well fed.The grouping of the enclosure and the pathway leading to them make for a joyful trip of discovering. The wordings are just sufficient to introduce the important points about the animals.Staff are helpful and happy. A great 3 hours trip.In terms of refreshment, lots of drink vending machine can be found with small food kiosk and a food court. Oh, there's also a KFC at the end of the zoo before you turned back and head to the entrance/exit.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1c/c4/8b/75/kyheng.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r784149024-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,Rhiannon H,Beautiful!,50,27-Feb-21,"A beautifully kept zoo! The range of animals was fantastic! It sets itself apart from other zoos with the free roaming animals, orangutans overhead and experience exhibits.

Singapore Zoo,Blackmentos94,Really the best!,50,19-Feb-21,"Singapore Zoo is really a gem. Can't say how proud I am to have such a world class zoo in our city.Love how educational our zoo is and the amazing variety of animals we have here.Easy to get around, I think it's worth a visit just for fun if you haven't been to the zoo for ages like myself.Keep it up Singapore zoo team!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/12/cf/08/31/blackmentos94.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r783158199-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,tromboon1220,Fun and Convenient,50,14-Feb-21,"It was rather exciting and a very personalised private tour! Really big thanks to our wildlife experience guide Neetha and Gen :) Had a request for mandarin speaking guide and they really they tried their best to explain to us in Chinese haha. They were also able to make an advance booking for us for animal presentation and allow us to go in without any booking in advance made by ourselves. Fuss free!They were also really patience despite having my dad not being able to catch up and corporate at times. However, the private buggy tour were really fun ! Will definitely come back for more.Personally I would recommend coming in the morning slot (930am) as you would get more time to walk around and taking a look at the zoo. Also, a properly planned itinerary will also make the tour a lot more fun as well.Overall, I felt that my 2nd day of outing to zoo was well spent!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/97/94/4e/bibb223.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r782808538-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,Kelly0831,Truly a Wildlife Experience!,50,13-Feb-21,"Used our SRV (rediscovery voucher) and was so glad we did that. Having been to massive zoos in China, I think WRS is truly a WILDLIFE zoo. Great diversity of nature and the beauty of all kinds of wildlife. Also a very enriching & knowledge-filled place , allowing us to appreciate nature at her best. Thanks for reminding us that size of the animals is not the only yardstick of beauty !My husband did however noticed that we were pretty far from the animals , he would loved if we are closer. Also an itinerary of performance time slots at the e-ticket email or a flyer at the entrance area would be handy. We didn't get to watch any performance while we were there, I was too tired to google for the time slots.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/f4/88/74/kelly0831.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r782782660-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,Hasnah1962,World's best zoo!,50,20-Jan-21,"Singapore Zoo is listed as one of the world's best zoo not for nothing. It has all the traditional zoo animals like elephants, tigers, lions, monkeys, and crocodiles, but it also has many unique and endangered animals like the alligator shaped turtle and the babirusas, also called deer-pigs. It is in the swine family found in Sulawesi, Togian, Sula and Buru. Singapore zoo is also home for giraffes, zebras, warthogs, rhinos, lions, cheetahs and many others. There is also play and activity area for young kids to have fun.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/b2/5f/88/hasnah1962.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r781464301-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,William C,A Heartwarming experience only at Singapore Zoo,50,19-Jan-21,"It was indeed very heartwarming to visit Singapore zoo especially with their conservation programs ensuring the protection of some endangered species of which they house 34% of it. Built in 1973 and set on a 26 hectares land in a natural open rain forest environment in Mandai Lake. It has over a million visitors annually and houses more than 30 species of animals. If you would like to relax, take some good photos and videos, escape from the hustle and bustle of the big city and most of all contribute to the conservation and rehabilitation of threatened species then have some time to visit SG zoo. If you book online tickets are cheaper than walk in. Also, if you will avail their annual membership you will get discounts and privileges. The zoo is part of the trip of parks called Wildlife Reserves Singapore together with Jurong Bird Park and the Night Safari. The zoo is pretty big so if you wanna spare walking then you can take a tram for a quick drive by tour of the zoo's different areas. The zoo is divided into 11 zones namely Australasia, Elephants of Asia, Fragile forest, Great rift valley of Ethiopia, Primate kingdom, Reptile Garden, Wild Africa, Treetops trail to name some of those I've visited. In addition they have numerous shows and activities. As you enter the zoo you might get overwhelmed but my tip is to just follow the flow and to help you can download their Digital Map guide. You could go right and you'll pass by the African Penguins which is currently closed which will lead you straight to Ah Meng Restaurant or go left via the Tree top trail and will lead you to the Rainforest. Either way will give you access to different zones in the zoo. I personally walked my way to different zones and took my approximately 3 hours. Be mindful with the Show timings and audience since there is crowd control measures during the pandemic. Facemasks are also required whilst you are in the zoo. I loved everything - how they designed the zoo in an open natural environment which is really remarkable. A lot of animals are securely placed in their zones, moats were provided to some and they have ample space. Some you could even interact with like the Fragile forest where you could be up close to the Flying Fox, Birds, Butterflies, and Deers. My favorite attractions are the Bengal White Tiger, Elephants of Asia, Hamadryas Baboon, Nubian Ibex, Animals in the Fragile Forest, Giraffe, Orangutans, the Otters, Pygmy Hippopotamus, Grey Kangaroo and the funny cute Meerkats who are always on the lookout. The Bengal white tigers (2 of them) are housed in a huge open space mini forest enclosure with water filled moat. They showcased elegance, strength, confidence and beauty especially with their furs in white and black stripes. Elephants of Asia showcases Asian Elephants all five of them female coming from Sri Lanka and Sumatra to name a few. They have a very earthy enclosure and I loved to see when their being fed. Despite their huge sizes they eat slowly with the help of their trunks before gently chewing the grass. The Baboons and Ibex are placed in the Great Rift Valley. It was designed like a rock mountain cliff similar to the environment where they live in Ethiopia plus an Amazing waterfalls. It's surprising to to see this mix of 2 species side by side showing no conflicts. The Baboons of course are very proud and confident as always especially displaying their pink faces, fluffy grey furs and huge fangs. The Ibex on the other have no problem maneuvering the slippery rocks even with those long sharp horns. The Grey Kangaroos too where such a lovely animals. Their enclosure have huge space for them to leap, feed and interact with each other. I really felt I was in Australia. When I reached Wild Africa it was already sunset. And it was such a scenic scene specially with the Giraffes. 2 of them while standing against the sunset is such an epic scene. I took a couple of photos and it was marvelous. Just across the Giraffes there is a small Earth mound with small pocket holes. And inside these holes lives the Meerkats, cute little stripped Mongoose from Southern Africa. I could see 2 of them watching the skies for predators which is really really natural. I took a photo of one peeking his head from one of the holes. Finally, the Orangutans from Sumatra or the Great Apes with their striking red orange furs are housed in a magnificent enclosure with trees, vines and resting places. Here the family could be seen interacting, resting, feeding, sleeping and gently swinging way up on the vines and trees. Native to Malaysia and Indonesia, Orangutans are critically endangered species but glad that Singapore Zoo is here to ensure the survival of this species. You can have a 360 degree view of them as you walk your way on the platform just outside their enclosure. As I walked along my way in the zoo I couldn't help but noticed that it is very clean, well managed, follows the social distancing guidelines, and very informative. There are plenty of toilets, drinking fountains, and vending machines for food/snacks. Ah Meng Restaurant also provides a lot of food options, coffee and snacks. I finished my day arriving at their souvenir shop just on time before they close at 6 and I bought a small shirt for my nephew. Outside the entrance there are plenty of food shops and KFC, which I had my lunch. If you wanted to visit the River and Night Safari they are just right outside the zoo and the latter open at 630 PM. Getting here I took the Mandai Khatib Shuttle but there are many ways to get here. It was indeed another heartwarming experience to visit SG zoo and each visit I take has its own story, witnessing how these lovely Animals live like in their natural environment. One of the best zoos in the world!!! I couldn't wait to come back again :=)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/81/default-avatar-2020-43.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r781365692-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,alwaysonvacay20,Always enjoyable!,50,16-Nov-20,"I've been to the Singapore zoo a few times and always had fun. Animal enclosures are well maintained, but most viewing areas are unsheltered and is scorching on sunny days.Food wise, there's an aircon restaurant and a non aircon bistro inside, selling mostly local foods like chicken rice, laksa and indian food. Honestly, prices are rather steep, but what do u expect from a touristy place? Good thing those with annual membership get a 20% discountThe park has numerous drinks vending machines & a fresh orange juice machine as well, but 1 cup of orange juice priced at $3 is $1 more than what is sold outside. We also saw a kiosk manned by a friendly staff selling drinks, pizza and snacks. There's also a KFC & a small cafe selling ice cream in the kids play area.It's quite a large park, so tram rides come in handy, especially if you are bringing small kids.Items sold at the gift shop are quite affordable and cute too",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r777267445-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,Chelsea B,Best zoo ever!,50,11-Nov-20,"We ended up spending about 7 hours at the zoo, from 9am to around 4pm. There was so much to see and do. Sometimes you visit a zoo and feel the animals don't have enough space, or that the space provided to them just isn't appropriate for their needs but Singapore Zoo had a really nice naturalistic feel to it.The zoo has chosen to house their animals in open environments, choosing to restrict movement through things like moats, rather than cages and it just seems to provide a better environment for both animal and visitor.Despite visiting in a prime time the zoo wasn't crowded, I never felt I had to fight someone for a space to see something and we were able to take our time leisurely strolling around.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1c/4d/f5/28/chelsea-b.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r776945176-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

The animals are well looked after and its just a fantastic day out!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1b/b6/5b/bc/littlemisssimmse.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r763495125-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,Ashley L,Fantastic and safe zoo experience,50,4-Aug-20,"My wife and I are animal lovers. We fell in love with the Singapore Zoo all over again, after decades since either of us step foot inside! We long to show some love to the animals there after the months of closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When this iconic attraction finally reopened, we signed up for the limited slots available on a Sunday. To our pleasant surprise, there were no crowds despite it being a weekend. The zoo has done a great job in terms of safe distancing: staggered limited entries, shows limited strictly to 50 pax (with ample separation between groups), and ambassadors around at popular exhibits to ensure there is no overcrowding. Not all the exhibits were open, for example Frozen Tundra was closed, I assume due to it being an enclosed space. However, we enjoyed the vast majority of exhibits that were open. We especially loved that the animals had ample space to roam around. We were so amused by the friendly monkeys and beautiful butterflies that came really up close to us too! This zoo is very kid-friendly too, so we saw lots of families. Just be prepared to spend several hours there to cover all the exhibits; there can be a lot of walking involved but at least the tree cover provided good shade. We hope to be back again!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/ad/69/ff/ashley-l.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r762940479-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,terisan2018,Such a GREAT zoo!,50,31-Jul-20,This is such an awesome zoo! Highly recommend visiting often. The tram is great but it's an easy zoo to walk and explore.

Singapore Zoo,Snagly99,Miss the crowds during the Covid-19 outbreak,50,22-Jul-20,"One bright spot during the Covid-19 outbreak is the lack of crowding at popular attractions. In July, 2020 my wife, son and I booked a mid-afternoon start time (caution: the Zoo closes at 6 p.m.) and risked getting rained on. On a Tuesday afternoon, we never had more than five people within view (sole exception: Reptile House). The animals were less spooky, with the highlight being two giraffes which walked up to within five meters of my son. It was a great viewing experience.Not everything is great, however. The tram doesn't run, so wear comfortable shoes. Almost all F&B outlets are closed, too, so drink water before you enter (or carry it with you). About 5% of the exhibits/animals enclosures are under renovation and the animals aren't on display. But none of those drawbacks detracted from an overall great experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/8f/67/c9/snagly99.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r760988309-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Had a great time petting tortoises and feeding giraffes. Will definitely recommend. Guide helped us to take photos and also provided wet wipes and sanitizer for us each time after we pet the animals.

Singapore Zoo,robertgaxiola,"Four Adventures, One Endless Story",50,26-Jun-20,"There are only three places to visit in Singapore and the Singapore Zoo is one of them. I visit the zoo about once a year and every time I am there I ask myself why I don't visit earlier. It is hard to find a zoo that give the animals under their watch so much care. They are healthy and treated with respect. The shows are fun but what really is great is just walking around and soaking in the environment for yourself. It is great for the kids and always worth an early morning visit if you're short on time. There is a tram if you want to give the legs a rest, but if you are able just take your time and visit the animal enclosures one by one. Speaking of walking, the River Safari, Bird Park and Night Safari are all within walking distance should you want a super adventure and visit all four.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/14/22/24/7f/robertgaxiola.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r758215434-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

We haven't visited many zoos, but of the ones we have visited, this one was by far, the BEST! We opted to walk around on our own during the late morning/early afternoon and spent about 3 to 4 hours at the zoo. We could tell the animals are so well-cared for. We fed the elephants, which was such a neat experience given that we didn't have time to go to the elephant sancutary while visiting Phuket (next time!). We had the opportunity to see so many ""different"" animals that we've never seen at any other zoo we've been to in the U.S. (such as the Bronx Zoo and Phoenix Zoo). The grounds of the zoo are truly GORGEOUS, and we wish we could have spent more time here.

Singapore Zoo,Grover R,"Great zoo, but not necessarily unique",50,31-Mar-20,"Our visit to the Zoo was part of Breakfast with the Orangutans. We loved the Zoo, but unless you have small children, I'd skip the breakfast and spend more time in the park. It is a great zoo and we saw nearly all of it. It has great open exhibits, including a couple like the Australian Outback where we had Wallabies hop right next to us. The animals were active and the environment was open that provide you great opportunists to see them as they live in the wild, especially the hippo and naked mole rat. In addition the setting of the zoo is a beautiful rainforest on the banks of a water reservoir, where you can see native animals that aren't in cages. Coming out of the reptile exhibit we saw a wild 2.5' monitor lizard that was a highlight for us.Still, while great, I can not say it is a lot better that other zoos. I will say if you only have time to make one visit out to the zoo area, go to the Night Safari. The experience you have at night is unique and can not be replicated other places. The zoo is just as good, but the experience at night is so unique and different.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/c0/f9/55/grover-r.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r752051094-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

The enclosures were scaled to the natural, specific needs of each creature. Sections have been created to reflect the wildlife of countries or related species in different locations worldwide. The individual and enormous creative attention given to the creation of enclosures such that every visitor has ample viewing, the easy walking paths with resting areas providing toilet facilities as well as food and drink options, the diverse methods used to convey information, the obvious contentment of the animals, and the helpfulness of staff are most impressive.

Singapore Zoo,simmo_smp,Fun zoo,50,10-Mar-20,"We've been to zoos all over the world, and this one is definitely up there. For admission, we got the 4 park pass (includes the river zoo, bird park and night zoo) which seems to be good value. As you walk in, they give you a map and it's pretty easy to find your way around. Given the time of visit, there was screening for coronavirus, which made us feel a bit safer.It's key to line up the times with animal feedings. They have a 'tour' where they go around and feed about 5 different animals in a 30 min window. It's great, as you get a commentary on the animals you're looking at, while looking at them up close and while they are active.The animal variety was great, saw an awesome mix of all kinds of animals. It's great that they seemed to be well taken care of. The highlights for us were the elephants (they have so many!), chimps and orangutans.To get there, we got the SMTR (train) to khabib and then the shuttlr bus from there that comes every 20 mins. Would advise buying the card if you're going to use the SMTR often while in Singapore. With the card, it was $1.60 ish to get there, and another $1 for the shuttle, and the range coming back.Overall it's pretty much a must visit while in Singapore, they have the river cruise next door so if you get the multi pass, beneficial to do both on the same day. Go early to make sure you see everything though!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r750224894-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,kikirilala,Beyond Expectations,50,5-Mar-20,"My boyfriend and I visited Singapore Zoo on Feb. 28th, 2020. We arrived via Mandai Khatib Shuttle bus at around 8:30am and purchased tickets for the Park Hopper Plus (SGD95). This included entry to all four parks which are: Jurong Bird Park, Night Safari, Singapore Zoo and River Safari. Our visit included everything except Jurong Bird Park since we found out at the ticket booth that this area was not actually on site with the other areas, but about a 20 minute drive away. We plan to visit again sometime this year to see it.Upon entering the Singapore Zoo, the first thing we noticed was how clean and well maintained it was, despite there being lots of people and animals there all the time. It's hot and humid most of the time in all of the parks so wear light, breathable clothing. Mosquitos live in the zoo as well so if you're prone to bites like me, I highly encourage you to apply some sort of repellent before entering. You could also do what I did and bring a small bottle of OFF! spray to carry with you for touch ups through out the day. We saw plenty of animals and got our fair share of walking done in this area. The River Safari had lots of marine life to see and we enjoyed the Amazon River Quest ride a lot. The 15 minute Reservoir Cruise was an enjoyable way to relax, take in the scenery and learn a bit of history about the area. At the Night Safari, it was very difficult to see things but we enjoyed the experience of doing a late night walk while taking some photos of the animals we could see. Some of our favorite animals to see from each zoo were: Cheetahs, penguins and white tigers from the Singapore Zoo. Giant panda, red panda and jaguar from the River Safari. Tiger, giant hippo and servals from the Night Safari.Overall, we loved our first trip to this zoo and would definitely recommend it as a wonderful place to spend a day with the entire family, friends or partners. Other zoos will find it hard to compete and this zoo will always be one of our favorite places to recommend for travelers who are coming to see Singapore for the first time.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/7a/a4/17/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r749160022-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,Jason894,Best Zoo Experience,50,3-Mar-20,"Really loved this zoo. So many different animals but not just that the experience you get in different areas and the views were fantastic. Its a must visit location, there are areas where you can roam around inside and the animals are loose walking and jumping around you. There was a bat eating just a metre away from where we stood. The butterfly dome was also amazing where they would fly around you. Lots more other areas also. The restaurant food was also very good and reasonably priced where alot of zoos charge a fortune for sub standard food. Separate to seeing the animals alot of the areas talk about the cruelty animals suffer in different countries. Please take time to read some of the postings, as an animal lover I really appreciate that the zoo has taken steps to educate us in animal cruelty. I really hope Singapore does more to help animals.

Singapore Zoo,NormadicLife,Singapore Zoo is one of the Best Zoos in the world,50,29-Feb-20,"This zoo is amazing! IT has so many different variety of animals from all around the world. Despite the limited area of the zoo, the representation of the species is truly global. Animals on the endangered species list are well supported and even bred offsprings. The visit is not just about expecting to see many animals of the same species, but it is about being an engaging experience as much as possible for each and every species where permissible. This is not a safari, yet the environment is brought to the visitors as close as possible. From a visitors point of view is fantastic. (Put must have dolphins or the polar bear that lived for a very long time there aside) However, from the animal itself living in a controlled habitat has its advantages and disadvantages. Protection of the species survival is the utmost, however, this seemed to cost the animal the required area for roaming, thriving and animal socialising within the animal species and inter-social with other animals. Although well, looked after, the animals seemed to lack enough space/area - after all this is a form of captivity. Most animals have lost their ability to hunt and find they home for survival.Still, this zoo is one of the best I have seen. All continents are represented. Making fun out of the zoo is also Singapore's greatest gift to attracting visitors to a calm, safe and hassle free zoo environment. Worth a visit and certainly all the attractions cannot be seen in a day - such and amazing design to a small area. With the adjacent attractions, allocate at least three good (weather) days to wander the zoo and surrounding attractions.This visit is highly recommended. Start the visit when the gate opens to get the most out of it, even for multiple visits.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r748282361-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,jeremyliew2018,Great for a nice little outdoor walk,40,6-Mar-20,The Singapore Zoo has always prided itself for maintaining a well laid out zoo with sufficient animals to interest set within a natural space next to a reservoir. They adopt good zoology principles like ensuring that the animals receive good nutrition as well as stimulation.There are sufficient rest points and the natural setting enables the visitor to appreciate the lush jungle surrounding it.

Singapore Zoo,ThiBRtravel,Good place to enjoy,40,21-Jan-20,"I visited this zoo few days ago.This was my first visit to this Zoo. Compared to many zoos I have visited, one thing I noticed is that the animals in Singapore Zoo are very well treated. They have more space and also the zoo is very clean.This zoo does have decent number of species. We went on a weekday so it was not crowded as well. Which allowed us to roam freely relaxing.We experienced a bit of rain, but it stopped in about 10 minutes, so it was not an issue for us. If it had rain longer, it would have been an issue for the visitors because I did not notice much shades around the zoo to find a cover.There were some nice artificial animals with some movements, which is a nice addition too.Overall, I think it is a good place to visit, specially, if you like to see and learn about animals.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/10/default-avatar-2020-8.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r740373000-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,Strayanadvisor,One of the Better Zoos Ive Been to.,40,11-Jan-20,We spent about 3 hours walking the Singapore Zoo and were constantly amazed at its fantastic set up and design.

We arrived early and were given a good seat. The breakfast itself was excellent - many things to choose from. Seeing the Orangutans was a bit disappointing. We weren't very close to them at all and it was hard to get good photos as they just wanted to eat. I think visiting their enclosure is just as good.The zoo itself is amazing still.

Singapore Zoo,misterperfect,A taste of the Wild,40,2-Jan-20,"A nice day trip away from the city. We took a cab there around ~SGD 30 each way. ParkHopper + pass was worth it since we did three parks in one day (primary zoo, river safari, 7:20pm night safari, rainforest lumina). We got there at 1pm and left around 9pm. The zoo is terrific - the open design is pretty cool, especially for viewing the primates. River safari worth it just for seeing the manatees and pandas. Thunderstorms closed down the boat ride. Night safari a unique experience, especially seeing the big cats at night. Rainforest lumina a waste of time - best to avoid.If you don't have mobility issues avoid the tram at all costs. The zoo is not that big. You could probably walk to the other end in around 15-20 minutes with kids. If you wait at tram stop 1 and the line is full, you will waste 45 minutes standing around, and you can't see much from the tram.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0e/3c/57/d6/thomas-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r736278703-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,ZohraD1984,Great zoo set in a forest,40,31-Dec-19,"We really enjoyed our day out at Singapore Zoo. Theres a lot of animals to see, and a lot of ground to cover, although not as big as we anticipated, definitely manageable. We found that the enclosures were very animal friendly and were much more open and animals looked free compared to other zoos. In terms of conservation they still need to do a bit of work with education. We found information about the animals quite minimal, and could do with more information (think London Zoo). The general organisation of the zoo was quite chaotic. We visited on a Monday, got tickets online to avoid queues, arrived at noon and found that a lot of people were arriving at that time and people were also finishing up their visit at that time. We found the staff at the restaurants to be quite miserable, and ran out of all vegetarian options. We also bought the tram pass but was unable to use it as the queues were quite ridiculous, people had been waiting 45mins, we tried several time to get in line and enquired about waiting times and was told 45mins at least. It's quite disappointing that they didn't have enough trams to deal with the demand. We also noticed that people were treating the transportation as a guide and not getting off. Often at the tram stops people were not getting off, so a tram would come by and no one could get on. This was frustrating and for us that we spent money on a service that was not properly organized. We also found that several drink / ice cream sellers had sold out of items along the way, we walked half way around the zoo and couldn't find ice cream at any store. I think SZ is missing a trick there. All in all it was a great seeing the amazing variety of happy looking animals in a great home. Definitely worth a visit.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r735747045-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,Sydney S,Fun,40,31-Dec-19,I was pleased to see that there were water refill stations. This helps combat single use plastic. The grounds were well kept and I enjoyed the zoo very much. The animals seemed to be happy.We did came to both the zoo and the night safari. We did both the same day.

Singapore Zoo,Kimmicruise,Lovely zoo,40,20-Dec-19,"We started with the breakfast with the orangutans at the zoo. We booked with safari gate on line. Once at safari gate at Suntec city we boarded an open top bus to the zoo, $84ea was our transfer to & from the zoo, breakfast, zoo entrance & zoo tram. Unfortunately we got there just a tad late & the orangutans were already out, so it was rush to hurry & get in line for our photo. luckily it wasn't to busy so we didn't have to wait long. The professional photo is $35 in frame. While we were there the sunrise program was filming so we got caught up in that as we from Australia too. Breakfast was nice with various foods. After breakfast we headed straight for the giraffe feeding, $5 ea , this was so cute. It was hot & we did use the tram for some of the way as we skipped kidzania as our children are teenagers & we opted not to see the Australian animals. It's wonderful to see the monkeys roam above, on signs & in trees. We left about 1pm again on the safari gate bus as they leave every hour back to Suntec city.

Singapore Zoo,Thomas J,One of the world's finest and well-kept zoo - for the whole family!,40,16-Dec-19,"Normally, I personally am not that fond of zoos; most are on human terms and are just for enticing visitors to see spectacular animals in captivity. But then there are some who care about the survival of all species and who work actively for a living planet and who also teach as much knowledge as possible about the animals you take care of. This particular zoo seems to be among the better ones and they have an impressive content with all imaginable animals, mainly from tropical and subtropical sites, as well as a very educational design with elements of fantasy animals and even the occasional extinct species. Singapore Zoo is a little outside the city center, but you can get here by subway and bus in less than an hour.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/27/ea/a4/thomas-j.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r732854127-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,georgiar2310,"Best zoo, poor shuttle bus service",40,13-Dec-19,"The actual zoo is the best I've been to; it's well worth the high end price to see so many animals roaming in large areas without nets and cages. The lack of barriers means you're closer to the animals and can get some great pictures (they use slopes, ditches and moats of water to prevent the animals from leaving their area).We also did the night safari which we didn't know was a completely different zoo! (Right next door). So if, like us, you're unsure whether to do one or the other- DO BOTH!The only negative I have is the shuttle bus service. We had to seek advice from the SMRT staff after so much confusion with the private zoo drivers. If you plan to use to shuttle service from the SMRT station here is how- You get on the bus WITHOUT a ticket (this is likely difficult as the drivers don't let you on until you argue and point at the sign saying 'pay on arrival', they speak no to little English so be persistent). When you arrive at the zoo, you pay for your ride there (and purchase a ticket for the way back). If, like us, you'll be returning for the night safari later, I'd suggest also buying the bus tickets for those rides to avoid the ticket hassle again. This is an extremely confusing and counter-productive way of operating a shuttle service and it leaves many tourists stranded and forced to pay high prices for taxis- please change it!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/19/f4/5b/47/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r732328273-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,OzJohnno,Well Laid out Zoo,40,12-Dec-19,"I suppose you could say that if you've seen one Zoo then you've seen them all. Not so in Singapore. This is a very well laid out Zoo that in the main is pretty flat. At this Zoo you get quite close to the animals and at times it seems like you could just reach out and touch them and you can at certain feed times - for a fee of course. We didn't. We left that for the young people to experience. There are animals from all over the world including a large Australian exhibit. I'm a big fan of Meerkats and Otters and I spent quite a bit of time at their exhibits.We used their ""tram system"" to get around the ground because this option not only helps the legs but it also enables you to see the entire zoo in segments We spent the entire at there starting at Zoo opening time and not leaving until around 4.30pm. Food is not cheap but quite tasty.It truly deserves a full day to gain the most out of this Zoo. We bought the park hopper option to see all four parks with a saving of 50% off the price of all four parks. Quite a bargain and you have a full week to use the pass.This Zoo should be a must see for all age groups.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/4a/28/0d/ozjohnno.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r732116569-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

The only area of improvement is to at least put up signs on where and what time the feeding trail will be as the area is large so that visitors will not be looking around and guessing where it will be and ended up missing out altogether.

Do note that there is free admission if it's your birthday and this deal is valid for 7 days from date of birth, actual date inclusive. Do refer to the website for more details.We have not been to the zoo in a long time and we were glad to see that the programs have been refreshed. There are now keepers' chit-chat sessions and animal feeding times scheduled throughout the day. This gives the visitors a more interactive experience rather than just looking at the animals going about their routine. The keepers' have good knowledge and are a friendly bunch.Rainforest Kidzworld: A must visit if you're bringing young children. My little one loved the pony ride, feeding the goats and bunnies in the buddy farm. Not to mention the ice cream break after that. However the young zoo staff at the buddy farm seemed a little jaded.We had time for 2 shows: The elephant presentation was educational but light hearted. Our children loved the way the elephants were playful with each other and when they could swallow an entire watermelon.The Splash Safari show was a disappointment though. The script was predictable and the jokes outdated. I remember that this was THE show at the Zoo but I suppose things have changed over the years.Access: We rented a wagon so the kids could last longer at the Zoo. If not we'd be hearing endless complaints about being tried from walking. So to a certain extent letting them ride in the wagon was also about their parents lasting longer in terms of sanity.Our day out is best described in my uploaded pics.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1b/52/06/2f/jattapy.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r728507471-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

It is, however, worth doing (four to five hours will cover it).There is an express link from one metro station, but unhelpfully you need a cashless card that typically only the locals have. Other public transport is possible, but very time consuming.So some tips.A taxi is a very affordable option, especially if there are two or more of you.Peak travel in the morning from city hotel cost about S$26, and off-peak travel back to the city $18 - back in 20 mins.Yet on our return there were no taxis at the rank, so you have to get lucky. Your backup should be however the express bus (mentioned above). If you are at the zoo, you can buy a one off ticket (S$1) and use this service, but no-one mentions this as an option.

By purchasing a ""Singapore Visitor Pass"" at Orchard Rd MRT for use on rail & Buses, it makes travel around Singapore so easy. $52 for 2 adults unlimited travel & a refund of $20 on return of the pass.We found the Zoo expensive for tourist charge being $37 each. It is huge and found the lay out very confusing going around in circles at times from one animal look out to another. Wear good walking shoes and take water with you.

Some were cash only, some didn't want to take passengers to where they wanted to go, some got hijacked by people from the drop-off area before they could get to the taxi stand.

Highlights are the Panda couple (Kai Kai and Jia Jia) and the live shows.Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari, and Jurong Bird Park are adjacent to each other and must be done on the same day. I visited Singapore Zoo, River Safari, and Night Safari in one day. These places can be visited on the day you arrive in Singapore but not the departing day as Night Safari gets over quite late in the evening.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/19/bf/63/1f/debashish1988.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r719756377-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

The few shows that we attended were entertaining and a good opportunity to sit for a bit. Paths are all sealed so safe and clean walking. The tram is a good way to get around for those with mobility problems or just plain tired.It was a hot day but there is plenty of shade. Lots of toilets, water refill stations and places to sit.

Singapore Zoo,RichardStevenson1960,Nice day out,40,9-Oct-19,"It is a very good zoo, but having also visited the San Diego zoo and even Chester Zoo in the UK we were a little disappointed by the lack of information about the specific animals they had. Other zoos give you a family history of the animals and their names so you can feel involved. Having said that the interactive feeding sessions were excellent and very informative. Overall a good day out, follow it up with the Night Safari which is also very good.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r716562361-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,Karen Y,Still one of the best plcs to visit in Spore n in the world!,40,9-Oct-19,"I visit the Spore Zoo almost yearly or bi-yearly. It is always well maintained and I love the variety of animals here. The 1st half of the visit was usual n nt as exciting as the displays remained unchanged. However, i was delighted that the Reptile Hse was v interesting with close up views of various lizards n chameleons. The Fragile Forest was sadly under going partial reno, but i still managed to see a few free roaming ring-tailed Lemurs, mouse deers, ducks and parrots. Was v happy to see my favorite Meerkats and the close up glass view where i came face to face with 2 Cheetahs! Most enjoyable part of the River Safari was not the Pandas (where 1 of them was kept due to reno) but the huge tank of Manatees. V relaxing to see them swimming gracefully at the end of the day. The Spore Zoo is definitely a great plc to spend the entire day out, esp if u love animals like me!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f0/48/default-avatar-2020-15.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r716492755-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,Vishal S,Must visit in Singapore,40,6-Oct-19,"One of the best zoos that I have ever visited. Nice place for all age groups. If you have plan to visit all the 4 parks (Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park), you can probably buy a park hopper ticket, which makes sense.Singapore Zoo is big enough a place and you can spend at least half a day there (many visitors spend a whole day). While the tram option looks good, keep in mind that if you want to explore the whole of zoo, you will have to walk a lot even if you get down at just the tram stations (4 in all). I would suggest better walk down instead of taking tram. Yes, it takes time and is a bit tiring. But you can plan to retire for the day after this.Kids would love the animal shows. Orangutans are a major draw. You can also have breakfast with them by paying some charges. Please check for timings of the shows before visiting. There's also a wet play area for kids which they would love.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/2f/ac/24/vishal-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r715515550-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,jamestX4338LY,"Lots of good, some not so",30,20-Jan-21,"We had an overall enjoyable experience, but for the price I thought it was good value, bit very good value. This is swayed by the fact we were advised to focus on doing the zoo first given it shut at 6pm (we arrived around 2:30pm) and the river safari shuts at 7. We had a good look through the zoo to start and other than the polar bears being off display due to renovations (a shame for us but understandable in any good animal attraction) it was nice. We the. Headed over to the River Safari side at about 5:30pm. The staff member at the entrance said 'you do the boat ride first' and pointed us to the left of the entrance. We followed the path that seemed to go on and on with various displays along the way. We were enjoying looking around but I was wondering where this 'boat ride' was as it certainly wasn't first. We then arrived at the Panda exhibit which was slightly confusing as it had a 'currently off display' type sign near the entrance - I was disappointed as it's rare you see Pandas so I continued up the path only to find it was indeed open and the Panda was in clear view which was great. We then continued in the journey to the next stop - the River Cruise, only to find it closed at 6pm (it was now 6:03pm). I explained our 3 year old was very excited to see it but was told no sorry it closes at 6pm. We were quite dejected at this as the ride was the only way to see the Jaguar - another rarely seen zoo animal. We then continued on our journey to find the squirrel monkey Forrest walk also closes at 6pm. If we had been told the timings of these closures or there had been announcements we absolutely would have rushed through as they are the key highlights (it's called River Safari after all). I mentioned in my way out that this was disappointing but was simply told 'yes they close at 6pm'...shame as otherwise we had a very satisfactory visit and these sorts of disappointments could so easily have been avoided.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r781460551-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Booking must be made online because of entry timing - due to new measures because of COVID-19. To ensure safety of visitors n minimise crowding. The weather was hot even on a cloudy day. The exhibits of animals looks more leisurely - again because of the pandemic. Some places you still need to queue. No more polar bear n the famous Ah Meng. Still a good place to spend the day with other places like River Safari or Night Safari after that. Be early for the shows - again limited n lesser seating due to safety measures.

Singapore Zoo,TallPaulLondon,Disappointing,30,23-Mar-20,"I had read reviews of Singapore Zoo as a must see and that it was one of the top three zoos in the world.Unfortunately I have to disagree. Although there are a large number of species at the zoo some of the cages/ enclosures are very small and I do not believe they are suited to keeping animals in captivity. The enclosures for the Lions, Tigers, Penguins and Rhinos were far too small and the creatures themselves looked very sad and depressed.I have been to a number of zoos around the world and this would not even feature in my top 10.Also the zoo is no where the main part of the city. I thought the trip involved a journey on the metro and that would be it. However this is not the case and it takes approx an hour to reach the zoo from the CBD. 30 minutes on the metro and then a further 30 minutes on the bus.Overall a disappointing trip and there are better things to do in Singapore if you have a limited time.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r751618041-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,Nitwit2015,Great expectations!!!',30,9-Feb-20,All these years I had heard highly of the Singaporean zoo so when I planned a trip to Singapore this was one place I was really excited to go with my little daughter. I must admit that it's quite systematic and organised and it scores high on the overall presentation but I failed to see a lot many animals and a few of them looked poorly nourished. Though this could be a subjective statement but I have seen zoos with better well kept animals. On all the other aspects the zoo scores full marks. The shows were not very interesting and the one I really liked was the splash safari. Rest are just okay. You need to walk a lot in the zoo premises so I suggest that you buy the ticket inclusive of trams. Keep yourself well hydrated as you stroll around the zoo since it's quite hot most of the days. You have plenty of water stations to fill your water bottles. Take a zoo map along with you so you can organise yourself better off and be able to watch all the shows. Food in the zoo premises is decent and a meal for two could be wrapped between 20-25 SGD. For those who have the opportunity to have seen better zoos elsewhere can consider skipping this one if you are short of time.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/18/9c/e7/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r743911952-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

To be honest apart from the meal which was of a very high quality especially for a buffet we found the trip a little underwhelming. Maybe we are too worldly wise and have seen many good zoos but this was a poor experience. We were taken of a little train through the park but a lot of the animals couldn't be seen which is why they had keepers in certain ares to wake up and handle the animals so we could see them. The commentary was fine and interesting it just that we couldn't always see the animals and you couldn't take photographs with flash, When the tour was over we were recommended a couple of trails to wander around or go and see the animal show. We opted for the latter as we hadn't much time and it was so dark neither of us fancied attempting the trails in the dark on our own.The show was OK but nothing to write home about.

Needs a more clear trail to lead you by all the animals. They make a lot of effort in making the park look neat and natural. It's not nice to see that most of the animals are in very small enclosures. Although I'm sure they are very concerned about the animal welfare, a lot of improvement can be made in that department. It feels like the commercial aspect is more important.The zoo is located in a quite remote area, so if you didn't pack any food, your only option is to eat the bad food offered in and around the park.Also did the night safari on the same day, I would recommend the night safari over the zoo, as they have a lot of the same animals and the night safari is a totally different experience than an average zoo.

They have a bus that runs every 20 minutes to a nearby train station, and unlike every other bus you rode in your life, you CANNOT buy the one dollar ticket on the bus, you must make the 8 minute round trip walk back to the ticket stand where you will likely be walking back up to the bus just in time to watch it pull out making you wait another 20 minutes for the next bus. I'm not going to lie, I almost want to give 1 star for this...

Singapore Zoo,travellingurolfellow,Breakfast with orangutans - do u like animals?,30,11-Sep-19,"Was highly recommended by friends for our kids and our kids loved it so it was worth it. However there are plenty of 'meh' reviews.Let me tell you what does the experience involves and hopefully u can make your own mind up.Prepurchase tickets in advance online- two parts: entry to zoo and 'breakfast'- our children didn't have to pay for breakfast, no breakfast ticket was issued though which was a little disconcertingArrived at zoo at opening - 830.Taxi from orchard around $20-255-10min walk to Ah Meng restaurant. Highly recommend renting stroller ($15/d) if your kids don't walk well.Lined up for breakfast and then guided to table. Slightly disconcerting that some people were able to prebook 'prime' tables but it doesn't matter in the end.Breakfast is pretty average - think 3 star hotel buffet. Plenty of water, juice and fruit though. Some hot food - bacon, eggs, kaya bao, siew mai, toast.Orangutans come out at 930 and sit on a platform. You can't touch them. Line up to take a picture in front of them ... plenty of time, NO RUSH. Everyone gets a turn.A couple other animals came out - two eagles, a snake and a cockatoo. U can touch the snake (if u want).That's it.

Singapore Zoo,BobSt23,Didn't Meet the Hype,30,1-Sep-19,"Singapore Zoo and the neighbouring River Safari are must visits when going to Singapore for longer than a stopover. The multi-park tickets are good value even if you don't go to all 4 (the other 2 being the Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park).Having said that, your experience cannot be guaranteed. A lot depends on the weather, time of day and luck.The weather was hot and humid for our visit so rain wasn't a problem. But overall our visit was disappointing. Animal enclosures were being renovated and in the open exhibits, many of the animals were invisible or immobile. I took 18 photos at both parks, compared to 87 at Gardens of the Bay. There was a decent variety of animal species and the parks are well laid out and attractive. I don't regret going but there was a wow factor missing. The Zoo has a big reputation and while good, isn't great. We didn't go to the Night Safari so cannot judge whether that would be a better option or whether you need to do it as well to appreciate the overall experience. We completed both parks in half a day.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/a0/81/e5/bobst23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r705128899-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,tham2015,Very different from years ago,30,7-Aug-19,"I used to be a Friend of the (Singapore) Zoo when my children were young. We had enjoyed visiting the zoo almost every weekend to see the animals and watch the animal shows. I remembered we would encounter animals at almost every turn of corners and my children had learnt a lot about the animals from the commentaries just by pressing a button at every exhibit. But that was many many years ago. I haven't gone to the Singapore Zoo for more than 15 years since my children had grown up. Last week i took my grandchildren (ages 2 and 1) to this zoo and i found it very different from years ago. First we were given a rather badly designed map of the zoo at the entrance. The map gave confusing directions to the various animal exhibits. The animal enclosures are far apart and the animal shows were not as captivating as before. The trees are so overgrown the whole place looks like an abandoned jungle. There was also no more recorded commentaries at the exhibits. Overall, quite a let-down especially considering that the much higher entrance fees compared to years ago.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0a/55/cc/2e/tham2015.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r696569393-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,mkerner2018,Expensive but well cared for animals,30,22-Jul-19,"We visited on an overcast day, although it was still very hot and humid so I would definitely recommend using the tram service as it's a long walk all the way around.The zoo has 'open' enclosures so the animals have more space and they have clearly taken care to give the animals a variety of enrichment ideas in their enclosures. We spoke with one of the keepers while walking around and he told us that the animals are all away at night (from 5.45) particularly the dangerous ones because all it would take was a tree to fall in the night and they could escape. Apparently one of their ring tailed lemurs has taken to leaving the area he is supposed to be in and likes to go for a wander but he always comes back of his own accord :)There is an amazing array of animals including orangutangs, white tigers, elephants doany more. I'm told the zoo works alongside other zoos such as London zoo in their conservation and breeding programmes.The zoo is split into four areas; the main zoo, night Safari, river safari and bird zoo.While we enjoyed the main zoo and all it had to offer including the kidzone, which has a giant water climbing frame and all the wonderful animals. Sadly we didn't enjoy the river safari so much, I guess if you like fish it's the place for you. In truth those only went to the river safari because that's where they have the giant pandas, the giant otters and manatees where a happy coincidence we were only in the river safari for 45mind. The night safari was amazing great to see the animals at this time of day, although definitely worth getting the first time slot of the evening as we had to question for around 30mins to get onto the tram. Each section is charged separately so well worth buying the multiple park tickets.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r691571758-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,DJL3131,Disappointed,30,30-May-19,"The zoo has had great reviews so I was expecting something amazing .. it wasn't .. Maybe for standards across Asia it may stand head and shoulders above other zoos / not sure as first time I have visited a zoo in this continent . It was easy to get around but felt there was something lacking.. at the end of the visit the only thin I felt and knew was that I would not go back to a zoo again .. I have no time animals are being well looked after , but I left with a feeling that some were in pens too small - the wolves were pacing back and forth in small space , the lions area seemed far too small and as for the few elderly elephants out in parade in the arena .. (which itself offered little shade for the people watching the 'show') it felt contrived and uncomfortable to watch. Though zoo is well kept of course the animals all seemed to be kept in areas too small . There was a homage to the polar bear (that had lived there )who died last year ... glad I never saw him as to think about an animal like that being kept in a city averaging 29 degrees daily , is truly horrifying( no doubt he had been well looked after ) but for me just emphasised that some of these magnificent creatures should not be kept in such false surroundings .. sorry not for me ..",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-a/02/e0/13/8e/djl3131.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r677506929-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

It's just not possible to enjoy yourself outside for more than a couple of hours in this climate.Also, I encourage you to take your lunch as soon as the cafeteria opens at 11am or whenever it is because if you wait for a proper lunch time you will be packed like a sardine in a half hour queue holding your tray, face to sweat armpit of every tom dick and harry's duck dog and you'll have a panic attack. Same thing will happen if you go to see the elephant feeding. If you go, go 20 min early so you can actually see the elephants while you're huffing those armpits, unable to move and trying to catch your breath.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/b8/7f/6d/windom-e.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r677495282-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

We have been to Auckland and Wellington Zoo in NZ and Taronga Zoo in Sydney and I would highly recommend any of those ones!

Singapore Zoo,Ammara A,In terms of the services there but the animals are love,30,7-Apr-19,We went there and everything was just amazing but the staff and the management is always more interested in taking pictures of people rather than noticing what better they can do to make it a better experience for people especially for babies. As Singapore is always hot and humid we went with our babies and booked the buggies and the staff failed to explain that this buggy will only take you to the stops not to the cages since it was the first time we went their it was staff's responsibility to explain us everything so we buy tickets if they suit us. So we were dropped at stops and we had to walk to the cages which were quite far from each other and because of sun my babies cried the whole time that we left in the middle of our tour and went back to our hotel Shangri-La... the buggy was also very luggage un friendly because the bigger strollers could hardly fit in and yes you have to fold the stroller each time you ride on the buggy so it was instead a painful deal for us to open and close the stroller after every 5 minutes.. they should put in some air coolers and a shaded pathway for people who are walking our heads and hair were heated like anything and we soon got a severe head ache.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r664327141-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,get2phil,Night Visit - Over-rated and poorly presented,30,17-Mar-19,"This is a popular trip, which probably explains its shortcomings. Hordes of people are put into 'trains' to drive through the enclosures. The idea is great, but it needs to be slowed down just a little bit to appreciate what you are seeing. It is like being on a very fast conveyor belt. The recorded commentary is also really, really bad - two very whiney American accents, with a script that is often really patronising. This could be a great experience but they seriously need more attention to quality over quantity, and to de-americanise - its Singapore! One practical tip: This is in the dark and flashes are not allowed, so if you are looking for a good photographic opportunity you will see less but get better photos in the day.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r658956092-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

There are not so many animals (usually only a couple per species, sometimes one individual only, with not so many species represented). We found that many other zoos in the world are better, especially Beauval in France. A disappointing and pricey experience.

Singapore Zoo,alwaystravel8873,Miserable place to see animals feeling like jailed,20,11-Mar-20,"50% of this place felt so miserable with only 1 or 2 animals. They are all looking at the feeding gate. It felt like they are all jailed. The animals are not as lively compare to many others I been to. No doubt the facilities are of certain standard buy the food and drinks they charge init is throat killing. This felt they are so purposely out to earn the money, suggestion you purchase your own sandwiches or drinks outside before entering this place where they are not friendly to guests. Example a plate of chicken rice cost between agd2.5 to max 4.5 at coffeeshop to food court, here they slap you with the price at sgd9.90. so obviously they out to kill. Basically you have no option when you enter this place of hell. Also we all seated to watch the elephant show ..the rain wasn't too heavy and yet they did not inform the cancellation until 10 mins later after the showtime, and by then the rain had stopped. This call service ? Real bad experience. There is no shelter in between if rains which means you will be stuck in one area.

Ironically, the zoo is filled with donations from ""foreigners"" - if they did the same for children's pricing it would be equally abhorrent.

Singapore Zoo,pekboon,very few animals,20,8-Jul-19,"Its been decades since I last visited. This time I thought my 3 year old son will enjoy it as much as I did when I last came. Truly disappointed. There is only 1 white tiger as compared to 3 whites and 3 brown the last time. 1 cheetah, 1 lion and 1 lioness, 1 warthog lying motionless, 1 sleeping wolverine. Most enclosures have only 1 animal of its type and some, no animals in it. 2 elephants, 2 giraffes, 2 zebras. Its a scorching hot day, so maybe the animals are hidden somewhere.We ended up spending most of the time at the Water Play Park. The park has a few setbacks too. The rubber flooring, on one side of the park, is covered with algae and makes it very slippery. There are some torn rubber mats that can trip you over. A broken slide that has been covered using a green mesh. One broken water sprout. The only fun part, where most kids hang out, is where the big bucket of water pours down onto you.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/67/avatar045.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r687659564-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,aquiloindia,Misguided while buying tickets or non guidance regarding park.,20,17-Jun-19,"I like to share my experience visiting the zoo on 16 th of June 2019. This is the first time we came to Singapore and visited the zoo.I am totally disappointed by the misguidance or you say say non appropriate guidance while buying the ticket. We reached around 11:30am to 12 noon we approach the ticketing counter and ask about the tickets and park details. We was informed that the zoo will cover in 3 hours and river safari in 2 hours. We bought the two tickets in combined, rest no other details was shared regarding the time of the park at the counter nor regarding any extra tram or amazon river tickets to buy additional in park.First we decided to go to zoo area where we found most of the shows are done in morning time just we got one show and rest 3 are around 4-4:30-5 pm around. We went off the zoo in flying as we seen in map of zoo that the river safari was closed at 7 pm so for us we need to finish this very fast but unfortunately we missed all the shows and ran for river safari and we couldn't be back to complete the zoo and we missed all the shows at zoo and half of the park as we were misguided that would cover in 3 hours.Secondly when we went to the river safari we went for the boat which you called cruise, we just see the wait time is there and when we check in at boat it was just a boat ride and no animals to be covered and what they show we already covered in the zoo. Later we found to know that amazon river have charged with wait time so we rush to panda as panda will close at 6. So we rushed but we missed 80 percent of the zoo.So would like to complaint about the misguiding while buying tickets and non guidance of how to cover and when all the activities and even mislead us by telling the zoo will be covered in 3 hours and 2 hours.

Singapore Zoo,Nav1224,Overrated,20,24-Feb-19,"I visited this place with my family and frankly I think this place is overrated.Firstly, the place is quite big and you'd be better off taking the tram ride with your tickets.Well, that's one thing, next the animals are so scattered you'd have to walk quite a bit. And even on doing so, you'd see 3 elephants, one lion, a couple of hippos and giraffe among the more exciting animals and then it's pretty much the same animals as you'd see in any other zoo really. So my point being, the zoo being reviewed as the best in the world is overrated. I would not call it that. It's just another zoo.If you've got kids, then you might consider visiting.

However when we arrived we discovered that you cannot just buy one ticket, you need different tickets for different areas. We decided on the 'River Safari' and the main Zoo.The River Safari is mainly a walking activity with a short boat ride on the reservoir at the end. We thought it was informative, and it concentrated on the importance of conservation. We enjoyed seeing the pandas.We paid extra for the Amazon river experience, this lasted about 10 mins and you don't really see many animals just lots of empty enclosures.We then visited the Zoo. We did not enjoy it at all. Some of the animal enclosures are really small. The exception is the orangutan enclosure where they have more free range. The giraffe space was very small and the hippo area even worse. Some enclosures seemed to have missing animals for example 5 were advertised but there were only 3 there and staff could not explain where the rest were. We know the polar bear had died but the area was still open.Some animals look distressed, the ostrich was pulling its own feathers out of its back and one of the white tigers was pacing backwards and forwards.We left this 'attraction' feeling quite sad for tha animals and could not recommend it.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r652007423-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,HobbledGrubs,Rundown and dissapointing,20,4-Jan-19,"Most exhibits were aged and rundown. Many animals were solitary and others appeared unhappy, staring at walls. Exhibits were behind scratched or dirty perspex making it difficult to see or photograph animals. The advertised water bottle refill stations were few and far between, cheap and ugly refreshment trucks were much easier to find. There was a tacky dragon exhibit with plastic model dragons around and a 'Sponsored by Game of Thrones' section that really felt out of place in a zoo. The trams for people who don't want to walk are annoying, very frequent and make it dangerous for kids as they share the main circuit route of the zoo. There is a new section being added to the zoo which will be finished in 2020, I can only guess that once finished they were being an overhaul of the existing zoo.

The daily animal shows were at over capacity and they had to turn people away at the entrance, even if you showed up 5 min before the showtimes.3. The 'Ah Meng' restaurant had atrocious crowd and service management. They rolled down the shutters and turned off lights a mere 2 minutes before they took the last order. If you are not going to provide patrons with a place to eat, please warn your poor customers before they buy food in your restaurant!4. We give 2 stars for the diversity of animals in the zoo.

Even worse, the standard of cleanliness of the main restaurant was dreadful, especially for such an otherwise clean country as is Singapore.

Singapore Zoo,jayplay135,Some very sad sights :(,20,23-Jan-18,"To start on a positive, there are some animals that are treated really well at this zoo. The smaller monkeys for example. It is nice and clean and the maps etc plotted around are very helpful. Now for the negative.... the majority of enclosures are too small and boring, and have further cemented my hate for zoos. The polar bear looked SO sad and had absolutely no privacy - this was probably the worst enclosure we saw on our visit. The cheetahs had a tiny area to run around in - not enough to satisfy their pace. The lions looked sad and had a very boring enclosure. They need much more room to roam around - and judging by other comments, I'm GLAD I didn't stick around for the show. WHY OH WHY can visitors pay to feed, touch, and have photos with tortoise?

Singapore Zoo,Sharad A,Zoo should consider how to manage crowd / capacity better,20,11-Jan-18,"We visited the Zoo as part of a trip to Singapore. Unfortunately, the day we visited, the Zoo had a very large number of visitors, way more than the Zoo's capacity.There was a rush everywhere we went.1. They ran out of wagons, and given we had two little kids, we were counting on that.2. We had paid for the guided tram. However, lines were so ridiculously long that we gave up and just walked3. The lines at the food kiosks were really, really long. We had to wait 25 minutes to get a smoothie. The food line was even longer, and we didn't go there.Eventually, we gave up. What little we saw showed promise of a good Zoo we'd like to see. But the rush was so bad, we couldn't enjoy anything. We left after seeing very little.We suggest to management that they have a capacity cap. It's better to turn away people at the gate. At least those who are in can fully enjoy the Zoo. I would have been much happier if either I was not allowed to purchase the tickets online (as Zoo is already at capacity) or even if I was turned away at the gate.We ended up getting in, trying to make a day of it for a couple of hours, and then giving up and heading back dejected and disappointed. More than the cost of tickets/taxis, we felt the pinch of lost time. Given the rush, we (and so many others) would have better used the day to visit something else in Singapore.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r552956202-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Do take time to locate the areas where these live shows are conducted and believe me you would take time to locate those areas. The mapping of the Zoo is so pathetic that it is very confusing to locate any area.The only highlight of the Zoo is the 3 live events that they have - Elephant show, Sea-lion show and Rodents Show. Don't miss these as you can be up close and personal to the animals.There is too much to walk and though you might take the tram, still there is nothing much to write home about.

Singapore Zoo,Mikki S,A bit disappointing,20,25-Oct-17,I visited the zoo 27 years ago and loved it. This visit was quiet disappointing.

Singapore Zoo,michaelp993,Money grabbing,20,24-Oct-17,"One of the main reasons why we stopped off at Singapore was to breakfast with the Orang-utans. We had been before and then they actually took tea with us, we fed them and one even sat on Michael's knee. Now the whole attitude has changed and there is no contact with the animals - it is considered demeaning. Elephants can no longer kick footballs and parrots cannot ride bicycles and Orang-utans can't be fed. Shame but there it is. I actually think that on the previous visit the animals actually enjoyed our company. So, dear friends, no more stroking the cat or taking the dog for a walk! The underlying principle is good and worthy of support but in practice a bit over the top! Google it and you will see some folks actually feeding then Orang-utans - forget it, there was no contact that I saw. All that happens is that about two hundred folk are shepherded into an average buffet breakfast (no criticism of that) and then in turn groups stand in front of the rather bored looking animals, have their photo taken and then spend the rest of the day trying to avoid the sharks waving their prints in front of them and expecting an exorbitant price for the privilege! Blatant money grabbing!Having said that a lovely zoo and we will visit again. Next time we will take a better breakfast in our hotel, avoid the hotel to hotel tour on the way to the zoo, see these magnificent and lovely animals in their normal enclosure rather than during their humiliating exposure!Overall the animals appear happy and loved, especially the polar bear, though even he or she (which? I couldn't understand the Singaporian accent of the guide) seemed lonely, but not so the visitors many of whom echoed these thoughts. I am disabled and remarked to my wife that it was pity that mobility scooters did not seem to be available. She investigated and found a large group of them parked behind the reception centre. I am not surprised there were so many parked for the price they asked to hire them was so ridiculously excessive that I preferred to brave the agony of my osteoarthritis rather than line the pockets of this money grabbing organisation.The food outlets were all good and varied and certainly prices were very fair and they certainly weren't money grabbing!Will be back in the future but in the meantime would like the organisers to know that I am fortunately not penniless and happy to pay my way but I do resent being ripped off!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2a/fd/9c/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r535588010-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Don't think that your the only tour to do breakfast, as we did, there would have been at least 200 or more people on different tours to have the so called breakfast with the primates. Then you line up for photos with them. You can see it in their eyes they look so sad. Its all money, creed, and it's just not in Singapore, it happening everywhere.

Singapore Zoo,konstandy,Not Fantastic,20,16-Sep-17,"Just went to Mandai Zoo on 16 September 2017. The last time i have been here was over 15 years ago. Came here to accompany my wife.Pros:1) animals you won't be able to see in a city like Singapore2) the animals in glass enclosures were better as you can see them up close3) was able to see the animal show about monkeys/apes & snakes - the highlight for me was the snake handler walked around for audience to touch the snake: i was able to pet the snake for 2 seconds which i never had the chance to do in my life - that was very interesting!Cons:1) It was raining on & off. The entire place though it has covered walkways was not all covered so we were wet: the management should think about upgrading the place since Singapore is always raining. They didn't have umbrellas for sale so we had to wait for 1 hour for the rain to stop2) Many of the animals were just sleeping or very far off so we couldn't see much. About 50% were like this. The design of the zoo was not good.3) There aren't many signs so we won't able to tell where the next exhibits are. Very confusing. Bad map.4a) VERY lacking in variety: if you see the map - a lot of animals are MONKEYS lol4b) Missing animals: camel, tiger, seal/walrus, horse, deer, different kinds of goats, buffaloes, wolves, foxes, bats, etc, etc. The big cat sections was also SO disappointing5) The dinosaur section got to be the lamest thing I have seen.6) the snake / reptile sections is VERY lacking: there are so many snakes species out there lol!!I really do not know how this zoo gets its award. Certainly not world class lolIf i am the in the board of directors, i will fire the CEO. Don't waste time unless you are a city dweller & never seen animals before.

Singapore Zoo,Gingercat_2010,Breakfast with Orangutans dissappointing,20,7-Sep-17,Don't get me wrong I didn't expect to sit shoulder to shoulder with an orangutan. However this was a tourist circus with little opportunity to see the Orangutans other than queue to have your photo taken.Breakfast was very good plentiful and lots of options but I expected to eat my breakfast and watch the Orangutan s have theirs. Instead they wait until most people have had breakfast and then the Orangutan sit on a tiny platform so you basically end up watching humans queue to have a photo taken.My advice have breakfast elsewhere and see the Orangutan s in their enclosure for better viewing and photos.Must say I preferred the night zoo somehow you don't notice just how small the enclosures are....,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/e3/c2/de/gingercat-2010.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r521921765-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,Ippy47,Waste of both time and money....very disappointing.,20,22-Jul-17,"We purchased out Parkhopper Plus tickets online, which worked out well. The tickets entitled us to entry to both the Zoo and Jurong Bird Park, a River Safari Cruise, a night safari cruise and travel around the Zoo and Jurong Bird Park onboard a tram. Firstly, the tram, Queues were long at most of the tram stops. From the trams the only animals we saw were giraffes and a few primates. It also seemed that most animals were sleeping, which made them hard to see or find.hile the Zoo is well laid out, it is a very long walk to try to see everything. Next, the River Safari... the brochure/zoo map indicate it was a 1 minute walk away (see photo). Beware... that was only to the entrance to the very long and hot walk to the pier for a 15 minute cruise partly around the reservoir. The only animals we saw were a glimpse of a rhino, a giraffe's head and some birds. Chatting with other visitors, we found out that the night safari is the same as the day cruise, but in the dark... and with that very long walk to the pier and back, and no guarantees that you will see any animals. We are both in our late 60s, and thought we were at least average fitness, but that walk was very taxing in the humidity.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/04/a9/26/41/ippy47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r504415885-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,DrCookie154,Was supposed to be special. Not anymore.,20,20-Jul-17,"We paid $300 + for two families, for the breakfast with animals. The Ah Meng Bistro. I wanted to treat my friends, but I had to pay the zoo entry fee AND the breakfast, so can't just pay for the breakfast as it is in the zoo itself, so you are required to pay both. That was just annoying! I just wanted breakfast at the zoo and they had me pay for the zoo fee! Completely ridiculous. So the breakfast was really nice. Then a guy in a green shirt started speaking and made cheesy jokes. Such as: ""I know you kids don't think suagr looks like a vegatable, but guess what, it does (Shows a sugarcane)"". I think his name was BOBBY. He started telling people that we can take pictures now with the orange monkey. Dunno what they were called. We went up to take pics. Orangetans?? Then a lady who worked at the zoo helped take some photos for us which didn't come out that well, but in the end we got clear pictures. You also had to buy the pictures if you wanted them. Then BOBBY took out the ball pytron thing/snake/whatever. He showed it to the front row and but didn't show it to the back part of the restaurant where we were sitting. You also couldn't choose your sests. So overall, I was pretty disappointed. I feel that this wasn't that kind of special breakfast. It was sorta regular.

Singapore Zoo,Akshat_Mor,Appalled by the small enclosures !,20,23-Jun-17,My wife & I are absolute animal lovers and hence were hesitating in visiting the zoo as the sigh of wild animals in enclosures puts us off. But Singapore does things differently & we thought the Zoo here must be a nice one where the animals are treated with love & care. But to our dismay we found that most of them were in really tiny enclosures and the red bottom baboons looked like they had some sort of disease with some having really really tutor like bottoms. Unfortunately there was nobody from the zoo around for us to get clarity on this. There is too much walking involved and the signages are confusing so you will find yourself walking in circles on numerous occasions. There are Elephant & Sea Lion shows which we skipped as we wanted to see them animals in their natural habitats and not in a circus where they are torture in order to get them to perform tricks.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0f/a2/93/6f/akshat-mor.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r495364873-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Also i dislike that for most animals there is only one public feeding the whole day. If you miss this, you will watch the animals lying in the sun doing nothing. The animals seemed to be not energetic and i felt sorry for them sometimes.Also i dislike how for examplr the lions are next to the zebras and even have eye contact!

The management of the zoo obviously failed to organize the crowd. We wasted too much time standing in long queues, first one was to purchase the tickets to the night safari, 2nd one was to enter the zoo are, 3d one was to take a van which we finally still missed. Then too little time left for us to see the animals because we had to go back to our bus. We paid a lot of money just to run on the zoo paths and see a few glimpses of a night animal life.

Singapore Zoo,269arnel,More vending machines than animals,10,16-Feb-20,"If you like a zoo to have more shops&vending machine than animals, cheap buffets, loud music attractions, depressed animals in small habitats and an expensive entry, this is the place to go. Observe the huge collection of plastic animals. Stuff yourself with pop corn and crisps and sugary drinks whilst watching some depressed sea lions do their trick under the shouting of an overenthousiastic animator. Compared to the domes&botanic gardens, which are epic, this was the most depressing visit in Singapore. A zoo should be about animals not about using them for the amusement of visitors in outdated shows. Many of the habitats are shameful, which is illustrated by the frustrated behaviour of the animals. Time to rethink the whole thing, in the mean time I won't be back.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r745351781-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,TracySian15,DO NOT VISIT,10,10-Feb-20,"I'm NOT an animal lover but as I'm in Singapore my friends said they wanted to visit the zoo as they had been told how amazing it was.WRONG!!!We went on the Night Safari tram. OMG those poor animals. Well the ones we could see. The elephants, lions, deers, bears etc looked depressed, sad and to be honest drugged up. The poor elephants looked like they had been attached to the tree stumps.When we got off the train we were all so upset, disgusted and overwhelmed we decided we couldn't stay any longer. A member of staff asked if we were going out and we said yes because we couldn't look at the sad depressed animals. He said they are depressed because it is raining. REALLY!!!We asked to speak to the manager but he wasn't bothered and told us to fill in a feed back form. I told him he wouldn't do anything with it so we won't bother.I couldn't take any pictures as it was so distressing.I wouldn't recommend this disgusting place to my worse enemy.STAY AWAY",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/5b/default-avatar-2020-61.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r743919217-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Different not less mate.... I can see clearly you haven't had to experience what it is like to raise a child with a disability.Water park area was very run down and dirty.

Singapore Zoo,SammyTse,Unpleasant Experience,10,12-Nov-19,"I had visited the Singapore Zoo October 2019 with my family, wife and 2 young children.I had exited the Singapore Zoo after completing the River Safari at approximately 5pm to 5.30pm. We, as a family, then queued accordingly to take a taxi. There was a long queue at the taxi stand which had the Regular Taxi using metered fare and the Premium Taxi at S$50/trip. The first 3 bays of the taxi stand were occupied by Premium Taxis. The staff of the Wildlife Reserves Singapore who were managing the crowd and another lady who seemed to be a promoter for the Premium Taxi service, were trying to convince passengers to take the Premium Taxi, which the people in the queue did not want to. For some reason, they were not allowing passengers to move down the queue to the Regular Taxi neither did they ask the Premium Taxi to move when there was no fare available for them. After almost 15 min to 20 min, passengers in the queue decided to walk down the lane to take the Regular Taxi. The staff of the Wildlife Reserves were not helpful towards these passengers.When I decided to also walk and take the Regular Taxi, I enquired from the staff, a male, as to the reason they were not helping us to get the Regular Taxi. In response to my enquiry the staff started raising his voice and shouting at me. The said lady promoter also joined the staff in shouting at me and my family. When I requested to see the name on their badge, they blocked my view and when I asked to see the manager they became belligerent with me and started shouting and using abusive language towards me and my family as well as showed threatening behavior. This caused my children to become afraid. I then walked on to take the Regular Taxi and several taxi drivers refused to take my fare. I boarded one taxi, and the taxi driver actually refused to take my fare, was rude to me and insisted I get out of his taxi. When I finally obtained a taxi, the staff, the lady promoter and the other taxi drivers blocked the path of my taxi, refusing to let the taxi move and trying to detain me. This went on for several minutes until finally a senior person of Wildlife Reserves Singapore approached the scene. Unfortunately, rather than solving the issue, it only got worse as the man, who is a Senior Manager, exacerbated the situation and accused me of being rude to the staff and causing problems. They threatened to call the police and I requested them to do so as at this point I was afraid for the safety and security of my wife, children and myself. They did not call the police to solve the issue and continued to harass us badly. The Senior Manager angrily gave me his business card and rudely challenged me to report him if I wished to do so. After much harassment our taxi was finally allowed to move.I have complained to the Tourism Board of Singapore and Singapore Zoo. I am still waiting for them to answer me properly.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r725803909-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,kassie_49,Save your money and energy!,10,16-Aug-19,Was very much looking forward to seeing the zoo but very disappointing! Incredibly hot and muggy (not their fault but nowhere to escape the heat for a breather) as the small crowded restaurant was not air-con and absolutely uncomfortable. At $42 entrance fee then another five for the tram very poor value. Worst of all though were the very small areas for the animals. Totally inadequate especially the larger animals. Not surprising was the fact that the pandas and the polar bear no longer exist. Very hard to get easy public transport out to the zoo so paid $30 each way via taxi. Total waste of money and time.

The two worst were the leopard and the Pygmy hippos, both were suffering with zoochsis (repetitively pacing) and both seemed to be in a huge amount of anxiety.There are other things to please they claim huge success with the orangoutangs and that is to be applauded, but the whole African area is not good, one zebra and a wildebeest in too Amal an enclosure and the giraffe is another, why not combine the two areas.Will I ever go again no not.Would I recommend it very much no",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/05/e6/1f/28/jonathan-t.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r678817633-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,Scaussieian,Tired and old,10,30-May-19,"Singapore zoo rightly is famous throughout the world. Indeed, the Safari adventures are great ! However, the old zoo is showing its age. We visited over Easter / ANZAC day holidays and found a lot of the animal attractions closed or 'unavailable' with apology signs up offering free Safari visits. The clientele consisted hugely of school day trips; so snakes of 30-40 children duly trooping round each exhibit and totally clogging the KFC restaurants and toilets. The one show we did 'catch' started 40 mins late and lasted 10 mins. Large areas of construction were underway for new exhibits, so expect construction noise and traffic until complete.

We queued for an hour and were told to go past the carpark and circle back to turn in. When we reached the front of this ""second queue"" the traffic warden turned us away and said there was a change of plan and that they would only allow one queue going in. I protested and said I was in that first queue and was turned away but the warden said there was nothing they could do. Thus we had to leave the zoo without going in at all. It was an incredible waste of time and my children were very disappointed. Needless to say I was frustrated and upset, this as nothing short of shameful.The zoo should also consider some form of notification / signs leading up to the zoo to indicate that the carpark is under renovation so people driving have some understanding of whats going on. The notice on their website disappears after a short time so its easy to miss; just make the warning permanent until the carpark is fixed.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/84/avatar005.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r667575308-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,travelerSingapore,My toddler say do not want to go zoo anymore,10,3-Mar-19,"First of all I need to thank your management for your tasteless marketing efforts to scare my 3 year old toddler not once but twice leading to endless cries and great fear shivering for her life. Having nightmares at nap time and bedtime.She was looking forward to the anticipated zoo visit today to see her favourite animals she read from books. We had been flying her around a few good zoos and farm stay in a few countries to give her that childhood experience.She entered your zoo entrance excitedly only to be scared of your fake dinosaur roars and scary looks. Immediately the crowd could hear her screams as if she had entered a haunted house fearing for her life grasping tightly to me yet screaming with fear when we HAD NO CHOICE but to walk through the scary creatures for 5mins. And before we left we HAD NO CHOICE but to pass by the stupid creatures again and she was shivering and screaming for another 5mins.Then she began to calm down and enjoyed her animals exploration and had a happier moment walking in zoo when it was time to leave the zoo, she suddenly jump up. Yes she JUMPED and fell down on ground and running for her life clinging to me when she heard the scary dinosaur roars and haunted looks.She had always like to imagine dinosaur world to be fun and interesting. After today visit to the haunted zoo. She told me "" Mummy I do not want to go to zoo again"".We had visited a few reputable zoos in the world like few states of Australia and few province in Japan and she will really enjoy the wildlife getting close to kangaroos and animals. Zoo is the happy word she reads from books and television cartoons. She had enjoyed around 5 to 6 zoos around the world since she began flying since 8 months old infant to visit wildlife.Thank you Singapore zoo for letting her fear going to zoo and scream for her life when she saw how scary zoo is.Have your marketing team not have the basic understanding that the zoo are for kids as young as infants to toddlers to children and adults? It is supposed to be family friendly creating that fun and welcoming factor for especially children?Have your marketing team not thought that the scary dinosaurs may scare younger children maybe below 5 years of age or not every child may adapt to the dinosaur? To have dinosaur world is a good idea but forcing ALL your visitors to accept them by placing at your zoo entrance and exit after 1 big round around the zoo is really tasteless in promoting zoo.You could have created a separated space just for dinosaur fans or older kids for their imagination to run wild. They HAD A CHOICE whether to step in to visit the dinosaurs and not HAD NO CHOICE but to face them.Due to your tasteless and brainless efforts to force ALL VISITORS to face the haunted creatures. My child now define you as the haunted place. I told her during her nightmare sleep that this is not a zoo and mummy promise you that we will never step into that haunted place anymore. Singapore zoo is a total failure with brainless marketing efforts.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/fa/27/4d/travelersingapore.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r656011591-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

This is not suggested as the Singapore Zoo will not allow direct entry to the zoo and will still make you queue to retrieve tickets from the physical ticketing counter at the zoo.A Singapore Zoo staff told us that if we had bought directly from the Singapore Zoo website, we would be able to enter the zoo without having to queue to retrieve tickets which have been paid for in full. The queue was estimated to be between 90 mins to 120 mins.This totally beats the purpose of buying tickets with full payment online (SGD175 single visit) to save time. The queue at 12 noon was up to the taxi area. It was not clear from the online Singapore Zoo ticketing vendor that our ticket purchase would give us different zoo access rights.Buyers beware!We ended up spending another SGD250 to buy an annual family pass.The Singapore Zoo should accord the same treatment to their ticketing agents and allow consumers to have direct entry to the zoo or totally stop agents from selling entrance tickets on the Singapore Zoo's behalf. The success of the Singapore Zoo as a family destination is solely the responsibility of the Singapore Zoo and should not allow such unfair incidents to fester.I wonder if the Singapore Zoo management is even aware that you are putting your consumers through so much dissatisfaction and hassle.Annoyed consumer visiting an otherwise top class zoo.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e5/66/default-avatar-2020-53.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r642541954-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,933alinamariar,Shocked to find that we had to spend close to $200 in 6 hrs. One of the most expensive places for children.,10,20-Oct-18,"We are residents here and yet we pay just as much as a tourist! Why is that? Should Singapore Zoo be only a tourist attraction? While Singapore has other places to go and let the children enjoy during their school holidays, those are very minimal, my kids still prefer the Zoo. But had to disappoint them by telling them that it's way too expensive, restrictive and disappointing. We had to go all the way to the entrance for some water refill because the water sold inside was $2.50 per 500ml!!?!?!??!!!!! So we had to spend $20-$30 for that whole day? Do you find that convenient or child friendly or easy to go and spend a day in? Food is expensive and don't even get me started on the quality! Huge queues we had to wait at to get food. Paying $8 for chicken rice? A coffee is ridiculously expensive! Terrible experience doesn't even cover our experience that day. Sadly we won't be coming back! We were a group of 5 adults and 5 children below 9yrs old. We all agreed that that would be our last visit there!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/44/89/f5/facebook-avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r626660637-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,Onyx L,Signs!,10,12-Sep-18,"Maybe you think you already have enough signs in the zoo, but I constantly got lost while I was following the signs and trying to find either the tram stops, or restrooms, or attractions. It's extremely difficult especially when lots of us tourists also have to deal with kids while we are trying to figure out the directions.Also, the purpose of the tram is so vague. Lots of people actually thought it was like the train in Disneyworld, for you to take a brief and general look at the whole park. But your tram only serves as a transportation, and we sat in the tram for half an hour, without seeing almost anything alive, except for a few larger animals.Also, your restrooms and trashcans are significantly in shortage. We had to run for 10 minutes, ask quite a few staff, with crying babies in our arms, in order to locate a restroom in a rush. And we have to carry trash all the time, before we can dump it into the trashcan.And the restaurants are so short staff and seating. When it's all packed, a long line in front of the cashier is only helped by JUST ONE staff. And your zoo is actually the most expensive that we've ever visited around the world, (tram cost is also usually included everywhere else.)Gees!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/ca/default-avatar-2020-51.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r615863372-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,s0utherna,Very uncomfortable and lack of animals,10,10-Jul-18,"The reviews are overrated, especially for the entrance fee. First we were informed that buying ticket online would save time queuing up. We were wrong!! The queue for online purchase to exchange for the real ticket is much longer than the queue to buy ticket directly at the ticketing counters. The location of the zoo is basically in the middle of nowhere in the jungle and yet there are only a handful of choice of foods we can buy to eat. Then the tram ride to get to one animal kingdom to another.. the queue is always quite long. The number of animals present in the zoo is quite limited, probably there are only two or three animals per species. For example, there are only 3 elephants, only one tiger, one lion, one panda. And most of the animals we saw were sleeping.There is also problem with the weather, it was very hot it was so uncomfortable.

I would have given it 5 stars EXCEPT after we witnessed the elephant show which unfortunately really tainted our visit.You cannot have a zoo and advocate for animal welfare, and educate us regarding the cruelty of training elephants when YOU have a show where your mahouts use sharp hooks to force them to perform stunts.Hiding the hooks with colourful tassels does not wash with us, I'm afraid- you can clearly see the elephants being stabbed and forced to make loud noises.For the 4th best zoo in the world I am bitterly disappointed that this is still allowed to happen.

All the animals were sleeping in the shade in their enclosures and appeared well cared for . The enclosures did appear small .However the real tragedy was the elephants . They could be heard trumpeting out of sight , no doubt being razzed up for the show by the mahouts. When they eventually appeared it was pitiful and distressing . Elephants were completely DEAD in the eyes , no doubt habituated to the poor treatment by the mahouts with spikey sticks .

This is shocking.We had previously read that the riding on top of the elephants was recently banned in response to growing activism pressure - which was a good sign ahead of our visit.I would like to know what acts of cruelty these amazing animals have experienced in order to domesticate them for such a show called ""At Work and Play"".This exhibit completely let down what was otherwise an amazing zoo.

Ridiculous! It took in part of the area of the underwater aquarium as well. No guided tour as advertised. People were walking haphazardly in different directions.The only sign of a river was the Singapore river flowing close by. and here was I thinking of a river safari by boatIThe young zoo attendants hadn't a clue about helping visitors, probably because they were not very conversant in English - absurd not to have staff who can communicate with tourists. When I asked them which location I was in, since I wanted to take a bus back- although I paid for transport back with the hippo duck tour I was told it was not available- I was told I was in the zoo!Don't be fooled by the hippo duck brochure. other tours may be ok but after my experience with this, I shunned all further duck hippo tours.Suggest they rename it as a 'habitat tour of the zoo' A real disappointment.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/15/37/53/01/krajjy.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r553260436-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,Penny D,Cannot recommend,10,20-Dec-17,"I would love to be able to endorse Singapore Zoo, but sadly I cannot. The polar bear is in an awful enclosure with absolutely no privacy - except at night presumably? Even when the bear is in its sleeping quarters the bedding is pushed right up against the glass, so that members of the public can get the best view possible, and spend their time banging on the glass.The elephants have to 'perform', the various big cats are all in enclosures that are too small. I heard a 'keeper' shouting at the otters while they were being put away for the night.There are many 'opportunities' to pay an extra 5 dollars for feeding/viewing the animals. The zoo makes no attempt to show off any of its breeding/research credentials - if it has any.It is a real shame but it just seems like a glorified theme park. We saw lots of animals, which in itself is fascinating, but I came away with a feeling of animal exploitation... if they ehomed the polar bear, and stopped doing silly animal shows it would be a much better experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f0/d5/default-avatar-2020-17.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r548087151-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

He couldn't stop repeating the same movements, you could clearly see that he has the sindrome of confinement than many animals which are caged suffer... they suffer from stress because they cannot follow their natual instincts and run, fish, walk hundreds of km and have an adequate and healthy life. Singapore is a very warm city and for sure it IS NOT MADE FOR A POLAR BEAR. Please do something about it, if you really care animals you may see that this is inhumane. Also having cheetahs and tigers in such reduces space is something you should consider...Animals are made to be free, I visited this zoo because I thought it would be so different and i must say i was surprise, but I cannot ignore certain things and I observed the bear for more than 15 min it was disturbing and heartbreaking he is clearly ill. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, HELP HIM, FREE HIM, but do not ignore otherwise you are just contributing to his suffering.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/11/ba/39/c1/jennscm.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r546146405-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Do not be tempted to waste your money... Whilst some of the animals are lovely to see and the presenter at the animal show is really good, this is totally outweighed by the overall chaos at the attraction.

Bring twice as much money as it will cost you twice as much...,10,10-Jul-17,"The zoo provides mobility scooters but to rent one costs more than the price of the entrance fee, essentially doubling the cost for disabled visitors.SHAME ON YOU SINGAPORE ZOO!!!Considering the huge volumes of people passing through here every day the zoo could well afford to offer this service free of charge to disabled visitors instead of penalising them.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r500231735-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,Russell S,"Expensive and not suitable for young kids, NO ANIMALS!",10,19-Jun-17,"I paid for the tickets with the transportation carts (extra 3$ per ticket)1. The park is too spread out and not well shaded so you will get very very hot and sweaty, the carts are always full so don't bother to pay for one its a big waste of money.2. The animals are nowhere to be seen! they don't have enough animals and they are usually hiding in the shade, moreover they advertise feeding times and then nobody shows up to feed the animals!3. The enclosures are very far away so you cant actually get close and see the animals, you would really need to take binoculars to see the chimpazees and white tigers, they are too far away!.4. The show times are too far apart, you will only get to see one show, they shows are also very based on conservation and not very interactive at all.5. They have 4 different parks with a ticket needed for each park, why not just have one good park!? the ticket is already very expensive.6. The zoo has retail shops everywhere trying to rip you off and get your kid to buy toys, why they don't simply add more animal experiences.7. The one area where you kid can actually touch animals is very very small and there are no staff to assist you child to interact with the animals i.e. could I buy a carrot to feed the bunnies - opportunity missed.8. There are many confusing roads that lead nowhere, also the singage is terrible, I spent most of the day walking in circles.9. They have robot dinosaurs, half are broken and they are terrible, again please just put more animal experiences, I don't need to see robot dinosaurs.10. The staff where useless, they know nothing about the zoo, and don't interact with guests or animals.11. The zoo is very remote and hard to get to, you have to pay for a expensive two way taxi, or take man buses and subways, why they don't have a shuttle bus downtown? I didn't see anything advertised. This makes the cost of a day at the zoo very VERY expensive!Overall a terrible terrible experience, the staff here should visit Khao Keow zoo in Thailand, or even twycross zoo in the UK, its waaaaaay better.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/59/default-avatar-2020-24.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r494112452-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,CA23ca23,Not so nice zoo,10,19-Apr-17,We were here at 10am on a Thursday and there are a million people visiting the zoo. Weather is tooo hot but was raining in the early afternoon. Not worth it. The animals are a few. Waste of time. It's 30 minutes from city center. We took UBER going back to the hotel. The taxi line is about 1 million people waiting. No trains or public bus.

Singapore Zoo,AlexMJ13,Terrible Zoo,10,2-Mar-17,"This zoo is terrible, the animal enclosures are tiny, a lot of them are just in there by themselves and look bored out of their brain and sad, running back and forth along glass walls continuously. The elephant show is appalling, this is a zoo not a bloody circus, no self respecting zoo would have their animals perform like that these days. And then they just take the elephants away... probably to a cardboard box somewhere until the next show. Not to mention everything is a money grab, $5 to feed the poor elephants, $5 to have an extra viewing. It's ridiculous.The night safari includes mostly deer of varying kinds and 1 tiger. The only good thing about it was that the animals actually had some space to move around without glass walls. The river safari at the beginning is ok, definitely the best part of the zoo.It's very expensive for what it is, there are very few food options and the options that you do have are expensive because it's not like you can go anywhere else.I wouldn't ever go back here, it's by far the worst zoo I have ever been to and it highlights the massive cultural differences in how people treat their animals.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/09/64/89/b0/alexandra-j.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r463916258-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html

Singapore Zoo,CarinaS2481,Injury caused by monkeys.,10,21-Feb-17,"I was here on the 20th February with my friends and at 2pm, we were at fragile forest, an open air rainforest experience.There was a platform that people are allowed to stand on that are only accessible by steps. While being there, there were two monkeys in circles, running across the two staircases, thus preventing anyone from leaving due to fear.However, due to a ""wrong time wrong place"" situation, one of the monkey, while chasing the other, charged straight towards my feet, causing a swell an injury, and a nasty bruise as attached in the photo.The injury left aside, I was appalled at the lack of staff in the exhibition especially where animals are free to roam around. Especially for the safety of the guests, particularly children, it is extremely disheartening to know that there are no staff in the area.Moreover, leaving the exhibition, we tried looking for staff to seek help from but to our dismay, there were none around.Personally, for a attraction that provides a service for people to view animals, the lack of staff is worrying especially when monkeys are allowed to roam around in certain areas of the park.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0e/7c/3f/43/carina-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r461473477-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
Singapore Zoo,veronicabellvictor,Could Singapore Zoo become Extinct!,10,30-Jan-17,"Much to do about NOTHING! I read on the plane that Singapore Zoo is rated the world's 3rd best! However, I'm not sure what year that was, because I'm sure it's not one of the world's best Zoo's in 2017. We all know it's just not fashionable to cage animals these days, let alone perform them. The Singapore Zoo still does a very lame Elephant show, with the normal bad taste. However, they are moving away from having animals. They maywel be the first Zoo to have NO ANIMALS! 1 Polar Bear, 2 Lions! In fact it's a lot of walking to even find any animals. The only exhibit that had any life was the Baboon caves. However, they have a plastic display of Dinosaurs. So maybe someday soon Singapore Zoo will be the World's First Zoo to have NO ANIMALS, just plastic ones :))))",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/c2/1e/3c/veronicabellvictor.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324542-r455739084-Singapore_Zoo-Singapore.html
