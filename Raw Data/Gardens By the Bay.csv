Gardens by the Bay,StefanS2173,Best,50,2-Sep-20,"Highly acclaimed and voted by many influential medias and travel portals as one of the best gardens in the world, Gardens by the Bay truly live up to its name. Over the years, it is a must visit for any Singapore traveller, and a venue for numerous events on the yearly calender. Spend a whole day here, even just the selfie or serious photography spots are already dizzying. And if you're a floral, fauna person, the flowers, plants, bugs and birds will keep you super busy. The gardens are segmented into various themed divisions and self tour guide tours are visibly located. Toilets and amenities are plentiful, even if you're hungry, eats and hawkers nearby at Satay by the Bay. Highlights here of course are the Sky trees, the flower dome and the cloud forest. I am not going to spoil the surprise but if you're touring Singapore, spare at least half a day here, at least. And if you're a resident in Singapore, it pays to be a Friend of the Garden yearly patron. Beside the occasional themed events, you can enjoy frequent dome and forest visits, you can also come exercise at the track just by the bay, chill at the sky trees, or enjoy a walk around the park.

And there's a cafe inside that served high tea set. In Cloud Forest, not too many things to see but worth a walk on the bridges. The view of the water fall as you entered is nice though. But we only spend an hour here. We started at around 3pm and have our dinner at 6pm, and ended with a nice stroll at the garden to the mrt.You will need to book the time in the website before you go.

Gardens by the Bay,Mdgrl79,Out of this world!,50,2-Jun-20,"We truly loved our somewhat brief visit to the Gardens by the Bay in early February 2020. Yes, it is crowded, but this is a must-visit while in Singapore. The grounds are incredible! We used a pre-purchased ticket that gave us access to both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. We absolutely loved the Cloud Forest, and an added bonus was that the cool temperature gave us a great way to cool off from the Singapore heat & humidity. While there, we considered buying a ticket for the Skywalk, but opted instead for Supertree Observatory. We visited Singapore during a very trying time with Coronavirus concerns, and we were happy to see that no stone was left unturned in terms of all the precautionary measures that were taken at the gardens to keep travelers safe. We even saw some patrons who were kept out of the domes due to having suspected fevers. The care and concern shown here was exemplary, and made our experience that much more amazing. We will gladly visit again on a return trip to Singapore!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r755762812-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Coffee C,"Just 'Gorgeous for Green Thumbs' and 'Excellent for Engineers', too ...",50,17-May-20,"Green thumbs rejoice (!), as yes it is true that, the Gardens by the Bay is gorgeous and just waiting for you, to check out while on tour in sensational Singapore. The sheer variety of healthy plants on display, make for a horticulturist's heaven, with gardens themed by both species and geography. The construction of these gardens also stands on its own as a major feat of modern day specialised engineering, as well as industrial artistry (the steel fabrication is just fabulous), too. In fact there is so much here that is amazing to see, that I personally feel that one should allow several hours to truly savour the visual delights. As 'variety (truly) is the spice of life' here, in reality, anyone who enjoys even the most occasional interest in botany, art, history and or engineering, should enjoy a visit to these amazing gardens. There is almost something for everyone to check out at Gardens by the Bay.

Gardens by the Bay,NigelG407,Great place - even if the Domes are closed.,50,4-May-20,Time for some exercise again. Today took the route from the Singapore Barrage to Marina Bay Sands Hotel via Gardens by the Bay. All very sad and deserted. Following doctors orders and trying to keep up my 5km per day exercise.The Domes are closed but it is easy to walk around Gardens by the Bay. It's extremely well signposted and any GPS will guide you.Nice statues at the Barrage in metal by Lorenzo Quinn. On we go up past the police launch's and there I see a Malayan Water Monitor - just a juvenile about 60cms with tongue out - very photogenic. Up to the Gardens by the Bay and around various lakes. Star fruit and ginger abound. White throated and white collared kingfishers and even a steel sculpture of a kingfisher in the lake. Ducks and various wading birds with dragon flies and damsel flies. Pink snails eggs - just like I remember seeing in abundance at Lake Paoay. A woodpecker pecking away to a tune. Besides the pool I see a fully grown monitor lizard basking away. The Gardens always reminds me of good times with friends. The artificial trees are part of the sound and light event that no doubt will return after Covid. A couple of planes from the Singapore Air Force fly overhead. When the walk was finished I made my way to MBS - sad to see it 100% closed.Covid is just like a war - soon may it end!,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1b/47/4d/9e/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r753129488-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,PhilthetravellerXI,Amazing gardens and landscaping.,50,3-May-20,"This fantastic area is located by the harbour front in Singapore and well worth a visit of at least 2-3 hours plus of you go later in the day, stay for the sound and light show where many of the sculptures are lit up with varying colours and patterns to the background of beautiful opera and music. There is an entry fee which varies on the number of sites you visit ' we did two ' the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. Both were amazing and truly beautiful in terms of size, colours, architecture, and gardens plus plants from all around the world, all under cover in these sites. There are huge waterfalls, spectacular indeed, and a fascinating display of orchids plus great areas of sculptures and statues dispersed amongst the gardens. It is all air conditioned and a very good place to escape the heat and humidity of Singapore. You can buy a ticket to use a mini train that takes you around the park but in fact we probably would have been better just to walk around ourselves. You can hire an audio guide but we were short of time and did not do this, we cannot comment on that aspect. Everything is however well laid out and signed and you can follow the guided paths very easily.

Gardens by the Bay,naiyanghappy,Plant tastic,50,21-Apr-20,"Staying at MBS l was fortunate to have a room with views over the sprawling Gardens by the Bay and its supertree Grove of metal trees up to 50 metres tall and the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest conservatories. Unfortunartely it was raining quite a bit during my stay so inbetween other sight seeing and the rain, l was able to walk through the gardens. Look for the many sculptures and visit the Heritage gardnes of lndia, Malay, Chinese and Colonial. The whole area is tranquil to relax and wander. Unfortunately due to stong winds the Supertree walk was closed. Then you have the two domes, l would say if you have a couple of hours to spare the two are well worth a visit and worth the 28sgd entrance fee. I was a little worried when l entered the coridoor of the Flower Dome as it was just huge pictures of flowers...oh this is not what l expected. Then you walk into the open Dome and the visit begins your eyes darting around all the flowers and foliage. I was there at the beginning of December so a Big Christmas theme was going on. Huge Cnristmas trees festooned in even bigger baubles. Ponseti plants in rows and rows the variation of colours l have never seen apart from red and white. Look for the wooden animals and birds carved from tree trunks. Onwards to the Cloud Forest. Its amazing how cold it is in here. What hits you first as you walk in is the worlds largest indoor waterfall spilling down from a 35 metre high 'mountain' covered in vegetation of all types. An elevator will take you to the very top of the mountain to what they call the lost world from there you do the Cloud Walk, walking down ramps around the mountain, the plants changing as you go to give you the feel of different altitudes. They do misting every two hours which makes it feel like you are in the clouds in the rain forests. Again even the architecture is awe inspiring, how can they have built all this glass and solid steel structure without any concrete is unbelieveable. The ground level has sections with Pitcher plants (fly eating), ferns and a fabulous orchid area ..my favourite plant. You leave though the secret garden with plants from cave enviroments and the tiny orchids so small you peer through magnifying glasses to see them. If you want to learn more about either of the Domes a free 15 minute guided tour is available on request.. the usual gift shop before you leave is there but take a look as not your usual things that get put in a drawer when you get home....unusual T shirts some made out of bamboo material, nice books, real pressed flowers in glass. I would recommend this as a place to visit whilst in Singapore and is good for hot days or rainy days.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/b3/db/f2/naiyanghappy.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r752791769-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

We paid a very small amount to walk the sky walk, you are above the trees and have a great view, although it is just as good on the ground looking up! There are two light shows per night and we stayed for both, one on the sky walk looking down and one on the floor looking up, both equally amazing.

When buying the tickets there are options to pick from (for the paid areas) and we chose all. It was worth the cost (itself highly reasonable) considering that we spent half a day there, lost in wonder and amazement at the varieties of trees and shrubs, plants and flowers, from the world over, which we got to see up close and personal. One can saunter or hurry through as one wishes, linger on in places of particular delight, take a gazillion photos of one's own choosing or in the many attractive settings created for the purpose, and there are no visible monitoring agents to curb one's style. Besides the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, we visited the Floral Fantasy, and finished off with an operatic concert at the Giant Trees. We also experienced the magical lake and several theme gardens (Indian, Chinese and so on) along the way from one area to the next.

Gardens by the Bay,425bethw,AMAZING!,50,16-Mar-20,"Free to enter for the most part, the two things to pay for if you wish are the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Both are super airconned and we think that's probably why they have a fee. We visited both. The Flower Dome was beautiful we spent about an hour and a half here. There are multiple sections housing plants from different areas of the world e.g. Mediterranean, Californian, the desert etc. We're not mad into plants but loved walking around and seeing it all. There seemed to be some sort of exhibition on Japanese Blossom Trees which was very beautiful. We think it was about 20$ for the two domes but we did get a discount through our hostel.The Cloud Forest was amaaaazing, theres a giant structure covered in plants with a man made waterfall! Awesome photo opportunities! You then travel up through the middle structure and work your way down through various levels and exhibitions. You can also walk along sky walkways or tree top walk ways. Very high up for the people who fear heights but you can travel down via stairs or lifts. At the bottom there was a good section on climate change and how we can help. Very informative and interactive for children. Misting of the plants happens every even hour...2PM, 4PM etc. We missed the 2PM one and forgot to hang around for the 4PM one but on exiting you get a stamp to allow you to reenter the same day if you wish, so we popped back in for the 4PM misting. Worth seeing! We spent about 1.5 hours here. We think we paid about 20$ for the two domes but we got a discount through our hostel.Outside the domes there are vast amounts of gardens housing plants from all over the world. We mainly walked through the Malay and Chinese gardens. I'd say you could spend several days getting around it all. There was an option to get shuttle buses but we just walked. The Gardens by the Bay light show is outstanding! We tried to get up to the Skywalker (?SCBC?) but the queue was too long and to be honest we reckon we got the better view from down on the ground. The theme was opera - not our cuppa tea but it was stunning to watch the lights flicker and come on with the music. The next theme until June is fantasy which means Disney! So jealous we didnt get to see that one!! To view from the ground it was free, make sure you get a good spot with the super tree in your view. You could also go up to the super tree and have a meal, no idea how expensive that would have been. I think the SCBC was about 20$.

We bought a combo ticket for this building, the Flower Dome and Cloud Mountain. Floral Fantasy was fantastic - beautiful flowers and lots of orchids. Globes of flowers 'danced' up and down from the ceiling in a synchronised rhythm and it was all so immaculately presented. Then to the Cloud Mountain where you feel you are inside a rain forest and can work your way up the mountain and across suspended walkways. After lunch we did the Flower Dome which had Chinese New Year displays and glorious dahlias. After that we bought tickets to the Supertrees and took a lift inside the tower and then walked out at high level between the other towers.

The gardens are so beautiful and with so little time there and so much to see we couldn't really do them justice, but we went on the skywalk that gave us lovely views so we could see a fair amount without having to walk too far.

Gardens by the Bay,TasStark,Unexpectedly magnificent,50,8-Mar-20,"The experience was almost overwhelming with the 3 glass complexes and different, beautiful, peaceful gardens around them. Floral Fantasy was an exquisite and unusual artistic series of artistic floral displays. Although my wife loves gardens her enthusiasm was understandable. I was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did.Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome also provided unusual ways for easily experiencing a wide range of plants and flowers. The first was a concrete artificial 'mountain' demonstrating the different trees and plants that grow at different altitudes and provided the environmental experience to go with it. The second had trees, plants and flowers, in continental zones.I cannot share more photos to demonstrate the experience.There are also 2 large food courts in which to relax, eat and drink and share either more western or more Asian meals.An excellent way to spend a full day.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r749811398-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Address:18 Marina Gardens DriveSingapore 018953 Tips:- Day time tour can be really hot so it would be best to wear comfy clothes such as a dress, t-shirt, and jeans or shorts and a pair of sneakers. - Bring a bottle of water as it could be very hot to walk around OCBC Skyway during the daytime. - The best time to visit is late afternoon but it could be very crowded with tourists as it is the peak time. - Sched your trip during the weekdays to avoid the huge influx of tourists during weekends and holidays. - Late afternoon could be very great to witness the transition during daytime and nightfall. Check the schedule of shows that normally happens during the evening. - Don't forget to bring your best cameras to capture great moments during your visit. - Prepare your feet to ache if you'll walk around especially if you'll go to Marina Bay Sands before or after your visit. Gardens By The Bay is indeed an amazing place to visit and I'll surely come back here in the nearest future to explore more of it!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/16/8f/85/4e/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r748933710-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

We bought tickets only to find out that they were for the 2 biodomes. By the time we watched the show one of them was shut. The other one was worth visiting though and it's not expensive.The actual light show was out of this world. The lights danced to classical music.

It could be that the man made sections kind of overwhelm the natural stuff, but it is one of those iconic places that is going to be near the top of most visitors lists, and it doesn't disappoint.I would avoid the hard sell for tickets when you first arrive in Singapore and head down to see for yourself what bits you wish to pay for.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r748337926-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

The cost to do these additional things are small and well worth every penny.Evening at the garden, at 19.45and 20.45 (check times when you visit) there is an awesome light and music show on these beautiful trees plus the eggs in the river.Lastly there are two huge domes;1) Clouded Forest- I have never see anything like this anywhere in the world. The size and scale of this dome is amazing, and the metal walkways that allow you to walk above the forest is awesome and not for the faint hearted.2) Flower Dome - tranquil, peaceful, beautiful.

Gardens by the Bay,C0nstantlyOnTheG0,Stunningly Beautiful and not to be missed when in Singapore!,50,27-Feb-20,"We had a 17 hour layover in Singapore and decided to visit Gardens by the Bay. We travel a lot and have to say it is one of the most impressive tourist attractions we have ever been to. The concept, architecture, geography, and plant life is mind blowing.My 28 year old son wasn't too keen to visit, but thought he'd keep me company and was blown away by it.We had a quick orientation of the Grounds by way of Shuttle, to hear a little about the place. This journey is not really necessary and it would be easily walked if the weather was pleasant.On the day we attended, the Skywalk was closed for maintenance. We were a little disappointed, however it gives us a reason to go back. We still managed to spend 2.5 hours here completing the audio tour and visits to the domes.The tropical setting of the Cloud Forest and the world's largest greenhouse, the Flower Dome were spectacular. Current exhibitions at the Flower Dome include a Dahlia exhibition with flowers the size of dinner plates. The Cloud Forest is host to Orchids of the Amazon and 7 levels of rainforest.The views of the Singapore skyline, including Marina Bay Sands are ideal for some great snap shots.Do yourself a favour and visit this fabulous site. Suitable for all ages. The elevated boardwalks are amazing and the waterfall and plants are incredible.

Gardens by the Bay,Della G,Gardens By the Bay,50,25-Feb-20,I had done some research on this particular attraction before visiting Singapore. This is a huge attraction which has many outdoor garden areas plus the two conservatories (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest) where admission is charged. Our visit was geared towards the late afternoon as we wanted to view the Garden Rhapsody sound and light show in the evening. The park is huge and one can only stay outdoor for a limited time before the humidity and heat gets to you. Of course you can cool off in the two conservatories plus the food court area. It would probably be best if you can view this area on separate days. It is absolutely an amazing and enchanting attraction.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r747431339-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Eileen R,Stunning - a 'must visit'!,50,22-Feb-20,"Having, on a previous trip to Singapore, visited the old Singapore Botanical Gardens and the National Orchid House at Changi, we wanted to make sure we visited the Gardens by the Bay this time round. It was all we expected it to be! We took a taxi from our hotel (advised by the concierge at our hotel that this was the easiest way to get there, and also cheap - $7). Taxis come and go all the time from a designated area close to the entrance. As I can't walk very far (and it's always so humid in Singapore) we started our trip with a buggy tour. I don't remember the cost but it wasn't outrageously expensive and well worth it. For 20 minutes you get a tour of the extensive grounds, with a commentary (in English). For those able to walk further than I, this would be a good way to decide which areas you'd like to visit in more detail. We next bought tickets to visit the 2 domes - the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome. Both were absolutely beautiful - the Flower Dome has displays which are regularly changed throughout the year. The Cloud Dome has a lift, which takes you to the very top, from where you can wander down and round the central area, which is incredible! It is created using hundreds of thousands of plants, which flower in profusion and enjoy the mist from the waterfall. If you've visited and enjoyed the Eden Project in Cornwall, England, you'll enjoy this too...even if you haven't, you'll still enjoy this!

Gardens by the Bay,B1528DYgabrieler,Great light show!,50,21-Feb-20,It was quite interesting to see all that diversity of plants in the indoor garden some of which are not native to the island. Sad though that until sometime ago most of those plants were growing freely around the island that now has been covered with concrete and tarmac. I guess in the northern areas there must still be a certain amount of largely untouched forest though. I will have to check that out next time. The outdoor gardens were also nice and pleasant to walk around. That's where the light show took place as it got dark and it was pretty spectacular. The choice of music going with it was also interesting and a nice change from the usual rhythms you hear around town.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/7a/default-avatar-2020-25.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r746450975-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Siobhan M,"Go twice, daytime for gardens and again at night for light show",50,20-Feb-20,"These gardens are fabulous- full of interesting sculptures and themed gardens by the river, you need at least half a day to see them all. The gardens are free but it is well worth paying to go inside the domes. The cloud forest has a huge waterfall, layers of plants and flowers, sculptures as well as a display of stalactites/mites.Music plays while you visit so it is an amazing experience. The other Dome is also full of sculpture, plants in geographical zones and a special flower area. Chinese New Year was good time to go as there were many colourful displays(Rat for this year).Then you need to go back in the evening to see the light show which is absolutely fantastic. It starts at 7.45(go earlier to get a good position for viewing) and the trees light up in time to music, an experience like no other. Take a video for replay at home. There was also a lake of colour changing balls on the way out by the Marina Bay Hotel. Follow this with the light show in Marina Bay(in front of the shopping mall) which starts at 9.00, a short walk away. Another unmissable experience, this time based on water with synchronised music, lights and fountains. You can also see this show from Merlion Park where there are good value places to eat. From there you can see the laser show but not the fountain show very clearly so you really need to see the show from both sides of the bay(8.00 and 9.00 showings). If you have only one opportunity see it from in front of the shopping mall.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/58/ed/5b/siobhanmuskett.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r746269277-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

The domes are open at night so it's possible to do the domes in early evening and then go to the light show. There are also extensive gardens outside if you don't want to go into the domes.

The flower dome is beautiful with exhibits of flowering plants from all over the world. At the time we visited there was a special exhibit of daliahs. The cloud forest is spectacular. A lift or stairs will take you to the top and then simply follow the winding paths back down past all manner of plants growing vertically around the central structure. There is also a water fall cascading down from the top. An additional garden display called floral fantasy was easy to walk through and enjoy flowers and a 4D movie of the gardens by the Bay Area.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0e/ab/4c/52/adoyle235.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r745630718-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,nutmeg2000,Amazing both inside and above,50,17-Feb-20,"We went to the show twice, because the first night we were right in the middle where all the trees were, which was incredibly cool. You really feel the music and the impact of the lights.We went back the second night and just stayed at the overlook on the walkway attached to the Marina Bay Sands. This way we got the great overall view and took some great pictures and video. Both experiences were different and terrific. If I had to choose one only, I think I'd go with being inside despite the lack of good p photo ops.The easiest way to get there is to take the walk way from the Marina Bay Sands (casino side) conveniently located near the light show over the Bay. After the light show, walk inside and go straight. About 1/3 of the way through the building, there will be an alcove with escalators up and signs for going to gardens by the bay. You will go quite far up, then cross the street well above ground, go through the other side of the Sands (the 3 tower ""boat"" side) and then you can either stay on this walkway to watch from above or go down into the park.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r745483199-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Soymoosemom,Beautiful at night,50,12-Feb-20,Visited late afternoon and evening in late December. Cooler temps in the evening meant lots of other tourists. We did not visit the conservatories but did do the suspended walkway between the super trees for a reasonable cost. Buy those tickets closer to the attraction and not the entrance. Better signage could have prevented us standing in line. You buy your ticket and they inform when you come back to the attraction. During our visit the trees lit up with Christmas music which is a bit odd for North Americans who are used to Christmas ending on Christmas Day. The eggs in the waterway lit up with changing colors to soothing music at night. Whole area is easy to get to by MRT.

Get the tickets you want - I took the bundle ticket which includes 2 conservatories (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) plus Floral Fantasy and Shuttle Service - they were amazing especially the Cloud Forest with the impressive waterfall and the Flower Dome. Go to Supertree Grove but you will need an extra ticket of 8 dollars to do the OCBC Skyway which you will get impressive views but it is better to do this in the evening before sunset,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/12/89/e9/63/topkingofkings.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r744392750-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Nitwit2015,Out of this world!!!!,50,11-Feb-20,"This place is a sure shot winner in the list of attractions in Singapore. Flower dome and the cloud forest which forms the epicentre of this majestic attraction is breathtaking. The place is huge so suggest, you guys reserve plenty of time if you wish to explore it at a normal pace. The architectural as well as the floral display truly compliment each other. Once out of the enclosed domes you can visit the different gardens in the vicinity. Best to be explored via shuttle service which costs 8 SGD per person. And then evening hours are best spent near the super grove tree. You can also take the skywalk and the climax is the light and sound show at the super grove tree which takes place at 7:45 pm and 8:45 pm everyday. We were unfortunate to have missed the skywalk experience because of the heavy rains.

But this goes without saying that this was a complete hassle when you have to (1) Check in Safe Entry, (2) Book time slot, (3) Scan your tickets. Yea you might think this is straight forward but it isn't because if you are purchasing your tickets from another booking platform (eg: Klook), and say you purchased 3 tickets for 3 adults, each adult still has to book their own time slot - not just the 1 adult that bought the 3 tickets. So it's really maddening and time consuming.

There can be quite a lot of walking and, if newly arrived, the humidity can be energy-sapping. We were impressed by the ingenious designs and presenation of different styles of planting. There are areas still under development. Staff were very helpful and there were places for food. It was free to wander around with tickets required for the special features. When we were there we didn't encounter queues. On a stopover visit it's well worth spending half a day here and we would happily return.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/68/default-avatar-2020-9.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r753414467-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Bryce M,Make time to spend outside the gardens! Beautiful view and confusing walk,40,15-Apr-20,"We should have looked more into how much there was to do for free before going into the bigger portions of the gardens! It was really cool to see as much as we did with as little time as we had, as well as the extra burden of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, due to the pandemic, there was literally no line to get into the SuperTree and both Conservatories. The conservatories were very pretty to walk through. We then went to the Super Tree (which was less than we thought because there is a walkway as well, that is not the ""Super Tree"") and watched the sunset. The experience was perfect for what we had time for, however my wife and I both agreed that it would have been better to allot more time to walk through the gardens being there is so much more to see than the two conservatories and the super tree. We looked on trip-advisor and other reviews of the gardens and were told that 4 hours would be enough time to walk through the entirety of the park. IT IS NOT! There is so much more to see and walk through, and we were there beyond the closing of the park.Finding the openings to the Conservatories and Super Tree from Marina bay sands was a pain! We walked for probably around 30 minutes before we were able to find an entrance to the park (In this area, there is no crosswalks, and all intersections for walking transit go underground or above the road), we followed the signs, and tried multiple different ways, and even talked to information desks and got no help to get there.Long story short, if you're trying to schedule out times, only go to the paid portions and take the loss of the rest of the park, and get a ride so you're not looking more for crosswalks than plants and sights.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1b/42/88/69/bryceamill.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r752641762-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

I really enjoyed the walk through through trees and gardens and the walkway offers you spectacular view of the bay and the Marina Bay Sands.The gardens offers an amazing lights show accompanied by music in the evening, its like watching light fireworks.

Gardens by the Bay,Lifeishardbutholiday,Wonderful!,40,21-Mar-20,"I found this place amazing, as did my children. The cloud dome was spectacular. I wasn't as fussed on the flower dome. Unless you like cacti and succulents it has much of what backyard gardens or parks have. We didn't see the flower fantasy dome which I think may have been a better choice then the flower dome, but when we went to buy the ticket 'bundle' described on their website they said the bundle was sold out. How can a ticket bundle sell out? Especially at 9.30 in the morning! But other than that I really loved the outdoor gardens and the cloud dome.TAKE A JUMPER (the flower dome especially is freezing), and don't forget towels and a change of clothes for the kids as there is a wet play area. We used the towels around our shoulders in the cold domes",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/ce/default-avatar-2020-7.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r751525585-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,881nikm,A bit disappointed,40,18-Mar-20,"Was expecting this to be the highlight of our trip, but we came home feeling a little deflated. First stop was the floral fantasy, which is very colourful and enjoyable and finished off by a nice 3D cinema experience. Next came the flower dome, which we found a real let down. A massive conservatory with themed areas of different parts of the world, this consisted of mainly trees and cacti. There are some clever exhibits scattered around within the gardens but apart from that it was not too interesting. If we were to return, I would not want to revisit.The cloud forest conservatory is far better and very impressive, having the showpiece waterfall and an orchid section which is a photographers dream. An elevated tree top walkway is also very good, well worth the money and probably the highlight of the gardens. Next came Suppertree Grove, which again was just ok. Once you have seen one, then the experience is fulfilled, the others seem insignificant. The observatory visit was part of our admission ticket and once at the top you have a really good view of the gardens. We made the mistake of paying extra for the skywalk, this really isn't necessary if you are doing the observatory. Would not recommend paying extra for it. There are food outlets in the Gardens but we didn't feel the need for food as we were only there for a couple of hours after having breakfast in our hotel. Cannot comment on the nightime experience as we didn't go back in the evening.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r751230018-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Phil W,You must visit this location.,40,8-Mar-20,"In February we visited Singapore for the first time. We spend most of our first day there and returned on a different evening to see the light and music show. On our first visit we used the transit system to get to Bayfront station on both the DT and CE lines. There is quite a long subway from the station that bring you out just outside the gardens. During our stay we walked around some of the gardens, did the Skyway, had lunch, visited the Flower dome and timed our visit to the Cloud Forest to be there when the mist was turned on. The whole site was spotlessly clean and the staff friendly and helpful. Having walked for most of our 5 hour visit we decided to return on a different evening to see the light show. We returned on a Friday evening to see the light and music show. We enjoyed it so much that we had a quick drink and stayed for the second show.

Purchased entry to both domes at entry, and after a leisurely walk through the Malaysian, Chinese and Indian gardens went to the Cloud dome.But first was the obligatory coffee.Walking through the entry doors to The Cloud dome has the WOW factor. This is by far the most impressive part of the gardens and should not be missed. You will need a few hours in here to do it justice and you will remember your visit.We were lucky in that visitor numbers were well down due to Coronavirus so we had plenty of space which probably at other times could have distracted from this impressive exhibit.The Flower dome in comparison is lower key. At our visit there was a new exhibit of Japanese Gardens, which although interesting were more focused for other visitors. Orchids were fantastic though.Returned in the evening for the Light Show which was OK but not fantastic.

Past the Chinese gardens which had plenty of grass areas to sit down and enjoy the view.Walked towards the super tree grove whereby they had the toilets, ticket purchase stands and souvenir stores.There we walked towards the flower dome where the fun begins it starts with a colourful lit up walls of flowers And leads up to the air conditioned massive automated doors inside the dome. On your right is an abundance of succulents all from around the world along with man made wooden sculptures which really complimented the settings. As you follow the path, we went back to the middle where it had the zodiac setup with all the animals again it was so colourful and enjoyable to see fresh plants.Afterwards went to stop by one of a few souvenir shops where we bought a fridge magnet (the other stores were much the same but not all had the same stock so still check the shops if you're after something in particular).To the cloud forest, now it was super cold upon entry and coming from the humidity of Singapore outside, bring a cardigan for the kids too. The waterfall was beautiful and sound was relaxing. Be careful when taking pictures as you will get wet and wear good shoes as it was slippery. Despite them having safety sign warnings , be cautious and walk safely. Heading towards the top of the waterfall was a long snake line so after reaching the top we walked it. Mind you if you're scared of heights might not be idealBut as long as you stay in the middle of the walk way you'll be ok. Really nice to experience the rain forest feeling , would've enjoyed it more if it wasn't crowded. Afterwards we walked to the OCBC skywalk however missed the time slot. So when buying tickets online make sure you go to the main admission area to get time slot tickets to be able to access the OCBC skywalk. Whilst we missed out as this wasn't disclosed when we bought it online and picking up ticket we stayed downstairs for the lights show. Choose a place to seat and watch the 10-15min show. Watch the theatrical light show which was ended the night on a high . Wonderful experience overall and will visit it again when it's not crowded.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r747865887-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,FMSh,Wonderful park but not impressed by the flower dome,40,22-Feb-20,We would have given 4 and 1/2 if we could. We visited the park during the day and at night (The supertrees at night were magical). We also visited the 2 domes (the Cloud forest and the flower dome) We started by the cloud forest which we enjoyed very much. We then went to the flower dome which we found disappointing. There was not enough flowers to have real visual impact. I would definitely recommend skipping the flower dome especially as the entrance fee was quite steep.Save money and walk around the park instead,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/97/avatar023.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r746666136-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,jakobg699,Very nice gardens - a bit expensive to see the indoor gardens,40,22-Feb-20,"I definitely recommend taking a walk through the Gardens by the Bay. The gardens are free to roam and very beautiful and fascinating in design. You can easily spend some hours here and just walk and enjoy the scenic views.The only downside I see is the indoor gardens and tree-top walk charges a rather high fee for entry. These exhibits are indeed something else, but paying 20+ Singapore dollars per event is a bit much in my opinion. I decided to do a few of them anyway since I was there and I do not regret it.Consider visiting in the night time as the lighting of the gardens is supposed to be spectacular!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/63/89/fc/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r746574928-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

The cloud forest and flower dome are too separate but nearby attractions that I really enjoyed and the skyway is a elevated pathway linking two of the 'trees' together which gives you a view of the city region.

Gardens by the Bay,AvgMom2Travel,Evening visit to the Supertree Grove,40,16-Feb-20,"We visited this man made nature park one Friday evening last December. We took the MRT train and got off at the Bayfront station and followed the crowd.We paid the entrance fee of 10 SGD ($7.50) pp to enter. (We thought it was free!) Christmas theme was everywhere, including carolers singing on the stage. We walked some distance to see the giant artificial trees. Before reaching there, we saw a lot of giant white eggs on the water.The Supertrees were magnificent! The trunks of the trees have live plants and ferns. Connecting between the Supertrees are skywalks. You have to pay a fee if you want to walk up there.The first show start at 7:45 PM. The second show starts one hour later. Not all the Suptertrees light up. We were glad we found a spot to sit because as we got closer to the show time, it got really, REALLY, crowded! People were pushing and shoving trying to take photos. The light show lasted around 15 minutes.Trying to leave after the show was another problem. All the people were exiting at the same time and it was simply a sea of humanity! Next time we visit Singapore, we will come here during the daytime and on a weekday, certainly not on Friday night!

I went during the Christmas period so there were a lot more displays to see.Stayed for over 3 hours exploring all the different exhibits including the Flower Dome etc. Went back in the evening on another day to see the Christmas Wonderland and the light show.A good tip! If you're short on time and want to make your money's worth, go in the late afternoon...! That way you get to explore the place in the day, have dinner and continue exploring at night all for 1 single price!!! Most exhibits allows for re-entry, except for the Skypark.So go to that place last, just before sunset to take photos of the city and stay there for a little longer to have a bird's eye view of the city lights and the light show on the Super Trees!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/00/76/e1/mhsiong.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r742358229-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,estokoe14,Tropical Paradise,40,27-Jan-20,"Gardens by the Bay is an absolute must while you're in Singapore. It's free to just wander around but if you want to go inside the domes there is a small ticket fee. We went in the Cloud garden but not the Flower dome. Satay by the bay is just a short walk and the street food there is varied and yummy.The Cloud garden is a huge indoor area full of tropical plants, flowers, a huge walkway and waterfall. It's pleasantly cool (but humid) in there, so gave us some welcome relief from the heat outside. It's actually a huge area to walk around so give yourself plenty of time to explore.The only reason this place isn't 5/5 is because inside the cloud dome it's not clear where to go - the path often branches and you're not sure if you're going to work your way round to that bit or accidentally miss something out. A few signposts would solve this.I've reviewed the super trees separately, which are INCREDIBLE, so don't miss those.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r741336811-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

We bought tickets to go up the Supertree but no one mentioned that there would be a closure on the 20th, so the ticket was invalid and they don't do refunds , sorry but that's poor!!! So we paid $6 more and went up to the higher sections, only to be told AFTER been persuaded to spend the extra money, that, if the weather changed they would be closing the higher deck.So sarcastically I did retort that maybe they should have told us all this before selling tickets ....Another group of people who had bought tickets by an agency had the same problem but they could not pay extra as we had, so walked off disgruntled!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/1e/2b/cf/jonboys43.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r740200262-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

The 'supertrees' are metallic structures which have been vegetalized, and a sky walkway some 25 meters above the ground connects two of them and offers great views of the Gardens and the Marina Bay Sands complex.

The day we were there, there was supposed to be a storm so the walking bridge attraction was closed...We went back here on a different day when it was cloudy and the weather was nice, we explored the place without buying any tickets, spent around 3 hours just walking around and seeing all the free areas, and it was so much better than the first day.Another recommendation go there in the afternoon so you can catch the lights, we went around 2pm and finished before sunset, but maybe it was because of the hot weather.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/1c/09/84/balines.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r738603982-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

This review is nothing on the gardens itself, but more for the management to read and to give people a heads up.The skywalk part is managed terribly - there is no signage or clues to tell people who have waited in a 30 minutes line, that once they get to the front, they have to go find another stall to buy yet another ticket, and get their time stamp to do the skywalk.I saw over 50+ people get frustrated about this and the staff don't do anything to change it or feel no remorse - It is not hard to change this and make it clear to people who visit that they need a time code before queing up, as they then have to queue for that, and then the line they just waited in. Complete waste of everyone's time - i am so surprised no one in the staff has reported this or there's been no change after a year of seeing this happen day in and day out.

Gardens by the Bay,shern570,An enchanting evening,40,31-Dec-19,"It was a Christmas program lights and sound. Enjoyable. Visited the gardens of Mediterranean, Africa and so on. However did not have that much time. Recommend keep at least 3 hours to see all.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e9/bb/default-avatar-2020-65.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r735800276-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,fubeca,plan to spend several hours and too much money,40,31-Dec-19,"We bought the double attraction tickets to the flower dome and the Cloud Forest. There was a line to get into the Cloud Forest Dome but it was only about 10 minutes. It kept moving. We were so excited to get in and feel the cool air and see the massive waterfall. Then we started walking inside and realized there was another really long line. We had no idea. So we waited about 50 minutes in a line to get to the elevator. The line keeps moving and you are walking along pretty flower beds as you wait in line, but it's a FIFTY minute line. No way to use stairs to go up. We contemplated NOT waiting and going up but we are SO glad we did. The views and walkways from the top are really amazing and just seeing the stuff on the main path at the bottom would NOT have been worth the money. As it is, it's a really expensive way to see some flowers. Many cities have botanical gardens for a few dollars that are just as beautiful. I'm glad I went ONCE, just to see it. But I'll never go again. Not for that price. Not too mention, the super long line inside the Cloud Forest dome made it so we didn't have enough time to do the Flower Dome. So money wasted. We also bought tickets to do the walkway. We bought the tickets about 4pm. And then went back about 6pm to get our ""assigned time"" which happened to be 7:40 which was awesome because we were ON the walkway during the 7:45 light show. The walkway was really fun and totally worth the $8 price. The line to use the elevator was short and easy, since they assign times (after 5pm they start assigning times on a first come first serve basis. you can get in the line to go up the elevator at your assigned time. It makes it really doable. But need to buy tickets a few hours early!!!) . They light show was really fun and the views were incredible and we all really enjoyed it. When the light show finished everyone was hungry for dinner so we went to the foodcourt place right there at the super trees. It was PACKED! It took some in our group 2 hours to get their food. crazy! During that time we were able to step outside and easily see the 8:45 light show from the ground. Really fun to see from the ground also. I do NOT recommend going to the foodcourt anytime after 7:30. The food is mediocre and pricey and the place was a madhouse! If we didn't have hungry kids with us, we would definitely have just walked and found something else. It's a really fun area to walk around and explore. Lots of nice walking paths. Great in the evening with the cooler weather and all the lights and buildings and water. I'll go back to the area to walk around and enjoy the paths but I will NOT pay for the domes again and we probably won't do the walkway or light show again. Once was enough. It's too crowded. Definitely take water and eat elsewhere. We did refill water bottles using the drinking fountain near the bathrooms. We walked there from Chinatown. 30 minute walk or 27 minutes on metro. So we walked and it was a really nice walk!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/11/default-avatar-2020-23.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r735773560-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,DeepakFromSingapore,A beautiful break,40,30-Dec-19,"Gardens by the bay , is a rejuvenating refreshment to the eyes and soul and breaks any negative bias associated with the term 'Gardens' you might have.It has two paid parks Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. The Former is a manmade representation of how forest in Amazon grows, beautiful, falls, mists and walkway created to give you a feel of what it could be.Flower Dome is a collection of various flowers , as do exist in a typical garden but with a modern feel.Besides there's a OCBC skyway, good for a one time visit but reach before sunset if you want to have nice photos. However the associated laser show towards end of day ( 2 timings) is really interesting.There's a lot of free area associated with Gardens by the bay which is a very nice 2 hours walk to the Gardens and a good day visit to locals.

The Gardens were thoughtfully created and all the lush greenery was just soothing to the eyes. The Supertree Grove was definitely amazing. I just wish I had more time to walk around and go up to the OCBC Skywalk. Definitely wear your most comfortable walking shoes which is a must for any sightseeing tour of any city.

Gardens by the Bay,dieselman_Singh,Must visit place,40,23-Dec-19,"Excellent place to visit. We were lucky that we visited there on just around the Christmas. It was all having a lovely Christmas theme. Otherwise also, beautiful place to visit.My suggestion is to visit there by late afternoon, so that you can finish it after the sunset, during which it is more admirable due to the spectacular lighting decorations.We were little disappointed in the Flower Dome as apart from few varieties of flowers, rest everything was just green and green and lots of varieties of cactus. Nevertheless it was still good to see all that.Cloud forest is one thing you can't miss. Beautifully made and with a tall man made water fall.Later in the evening, you can visit the tree groves and if u like can have a walk on the sky bridges which connects the tree groves (OCBC Skywalk).Ince you finish there, just walk over to the other side towards the Marina Bay Sand Hotel. Have a stroll and shop if you like and enjoy the Fountain Show on the river side of the Marina Bay. Two shows daily at 8:00 pm and then 9:00 pmOverall it was a good visit and we enjoyed.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0e/b0/2e/7d/dieselman-singh.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r734179553-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Charlene8115,Garden By The Bay By Night,40,22-Dec-19,"It was a blessing in diguise. Due to heavy rain. We had to skip watching the lion's dance performance at Marina platform. At around 6.45pm we left the place and walk to the GBTB. Wow heavy human traffic at the entrance. Queuing up like a snake. We decided to walk outside the garden. Moving slowly at our own space & explore the garden from different angle. What my camera capture were amazing scene from different angles and I am not someone whom is easily impress of what I had seen but this spectacular image that I had captured changes my mind. Free view n every corners that we walked is making my camera wanting to capture all that is happening. Spacious surrounding,very good for couple, family and friends, tourists and making very cents worth visiting this place. I spent about 1 1/2 hours moving around. If you have time buy a ticket n enter the Dome which I haven't try myself. My friends all very impress with the landscaping at different occasions n will try one day. You can also watch my Youtube video where I had uploaded one or 2 videos on GBTB n others nature walk around SG n some of cooking recipes at C Z (with a lion head)or ask for request to join in my instagram at charlene zhuang. Give a thumbs up or comments where I can improve my skills.Below are some of the pictures that is swallow by my mobile cam and hope you like it.Bayfront MRT station is where you should b alighting and have your diner first before walking. Carry a small drink bottle around. Food wise not really sighted unless you are at the Dome where a small cafe n a ATAS restaurant, souvenir shop.

It is a beautiful walk and offers great views of the Marina bay Hotel, singapore flyer and the city. The misting of the mountain was a bit disappointing, but the waterfall was beautiful.The flower dome was disappointing, they had a great display of Christmas decorations,but the flowers were limited. I wouldn't recommend spending money to see this.The floral fantasy had a vast array of beautiful flowers, but it was a short expedition. The animation at the end was great, especially for young children.The shuttle service is helpful, especially if elderly are travelling but it is manageable to walk from the entrance to the 2 indoor garden areas.The gardens do allow free access to certain parts, but you have to may for the cloud forest, flower dome and floral fantasy. Shuttle service and OCBC walk also requires payment.I would recommend a full day to take your time.

Gardens by the Bay,bodders6,"Beautiful place to visit, MUST DO in Singapore!!",40,12-Dec-19,"We booked to go to the Gardens by the Bay on a mid afternoon slot which we knew would lead into the early evening time - our idea was we would get the best of both, explore the indoor stuff and all the flowers etc in the light and then get the SuperTree show at nightfall! And we loved it!A MUST DO whilst in Singapore really, was as reasonable priced as you could expect for Singapore and we spent roughly 3-4 hours there if I remember correctly. The flowers, trees and everything in the gardens are absolutely beautiful and as for the SuperTrees and the show it was absolutely spectacular, really was blown away by it! The views from the bay in general are just fantastic and very romantic!A final note, we found it easy to get too by taxi or it looked like it was reasonable to get to by foot also.100% recommended.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/17/b1/42/0a/bodders6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r732074304-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

We are able to choose withing two dorms OR just one including with the Christmas Wonderland ticket since it is Christmas bundle. We managed to get the two dorms and Christmas Wonderland ticket online. It was so smooth and the staff are very welcoming. At 4pm itself, we left Cloud Forest and saw so many visitor queuing up to purchase the Christmas Wonderland ticket. To me, it's worth paying the tickets to get to visit the Gardens By the Bay as a holiday activity.

Gardens by the Bay,403chrissb,Spectacular,40,9-Dec-19,"Gardens' does not do this place justice. It is 100 hectares of lush tropical forest with walkways and water features. There are play parks for kids and designated picnic areas but the main event is the pay to enter attractions namely the misty mountain and floral garden both of which are a must see and worth the entrance fee. In the mountain walk you can see meat eating plants and walk through a corridor of orchids. There a huge waterfall and tropical plants and trees from all around the world. Inside, it is a riot of colors and smells wonderful.In the floral gardens they already had a Christmas theme set up so you can walk through pine trees to Santa's cabin and all the rest of it. Needles to say, it wears packed full of super happy kids!Inside or out (even in the rain!), this is a beautifully maintained well laid out forest-garden-park walk.A must see.Tip: the giant steel flowers. Walk (climb). Them only if you are fit and active as it is a tiring climb just to see the trees from above but most importantly. Time your visit here so that you can see these trees at night.

Gardens by the Bay,wotchewwant,Beautiful Place,40,19-Nov-19,"We entered Gardens By The Bay via the Marina Bay Sands. We took a lift to a magnificent garden path that overlooks the gardens. We then went down another lift at the other end. The gardens are peaceful and hold a lot of interesting artful sculptures and plants.There's a small train which doesn't charge much that will take you to the domes.The gardens themselves are even more magnificent in the dark when the neon gardens light up.As for the domes.The Flower Dome had a large array of beautiful rhododendrons each flower prettier than the first, (we had missed the orchids flowing season) it also had gardens based on countries, and we were amused when a tour guide explained that the maleleuca was used to make maleleuca honey. We didn't correct him.The Cloud Dome was even better. It has a waterfall inside. Walking along a path, when you reach the top of the dome it makes you feel like you are walking in the clouds using a specialised misting machine. The effect also assists in watering the mountain off plants that grow up the man made mountain inside the dome.If you look hard you will see several sculptures that look like they've been made from driftwood and a lion carved from a tree.There's also a plant in a glass case that is the last of its kind.Views of the outside off the dome are also spectacular.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/25/79/05/wotchewwant.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r727483032-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Peter S,"You're 22 m above the park surrounded by Supertrees and around you there's light, space and emptiness.",40,18-Nov-19,"Gardens by the Bay, SingaporeReview focuses on the Skyway & Supertree GroveThe Gardens by the Bay is Singapore at its best. The gardens come in three parts: Bay South, Bay East & Bay Central, of which Bay South is the largest (54 ha) and attracts the majority visitors ' for most, this is the park. It registered the 50th million visitor in 2018 just six years after opening. The park skirts Marina Bay on land reclaimed from the sea and exemplifies the vision of the government of the day for the development of a 'city in a garden' ' raising the quality of urban life by emphasizing the aesthetic values that comes from access to and/or living in green space.Walk around the park ' slowly ' and the visual elegance of the place comes across immediately. But there's more beneath the galaxy of different green/floral gardens within the park - the sophistication of the conservatories (i.e. Cloud Forest & Flower Dome), fun for kids of all ages in the water-play garden and the Supertree Grove - there are the environmental messages/systems that simulate the reality of photosynthesis, water harvesting, energy capture, heat disposal and more. This is a playground with features that entertain and inform ' what you don't see (unless you look for it) are layers beneath layers that underlie the complexity of the bioengineering required to support, nurture and sustain the botanical heritage that has been established.Sit at a table outside the Supertree Food Hall facing the Supertree Grove (with the iconic Marine Sands Bay Building behind) and there's this vista of green exuberance. The Supertrees are not real trees ' but tree-like structures 25-50 m high - that resemble trees in form and symmetry, and vegetation that has been established/grown to cover the underlying structure. In fact, the 'trees' have a reinforced concrete core with external steel frame to which are attached planting panels ' that form the basis of vertical gardens. Of course you can see it's not a real tree, but it feels like one when up close and, more so, when seen from a distance and/or when exploring the aerial walkway halfway up the trees.It was a Sunday, and we'd taken the MRT to Marina South Pier (end of the line terminus station) that morning to explore the Singapore Maritime Gallery and, couple hours later, figured to walk through the Gardens by the Bay; the distances are comfortable on foot ' once you're in the park ' the main challenge. We were not certain about crossing the Marina Coastal Expressway that skirts this part of the island and tends to cut the beach off from the hinterland. People whom we asked did not seem familiar with the 'walking' aspect (and tended to discourage it ' 'take a taxi' etc. crept into the discussion).Well, by chance there was a 14-seater courtesy bus that ran the route on the half-hour ' nice touch; we had the bus to ourselves with a courteous driver who dropped us off just inside the park. What could have been more convenient - thanks to the friendly man at the Information Desk at Marina South Pier.We've been to the Gardens a number of times over the years ' always a good half-day wandering and exploring; always new things to see. Finding a convenient lunchtime coffee/snack opportunity, however, was a key priority. Lots of signposts/maps around and there's no issue with finding your way. We crossed the Meadow heading into the centre of the park, skirted the Supertree Grove and then into the Food Hall, and out again (too noisy). Immediately outside was the caf that we were seeking. First impressions? Light, spacious, dominated by high pillars holding up the concrete road/footpath above, views into the Supertree Grove and, crucially, empty tables/seats ' great.We had not originally intended to explore the OCBC Skyway, but it was there just a few metres away. Why not! Snack finished we headed off across the grove to catch the elevator that would take us up 22 m to the walkway that loops around three of the supertrees - to hang out over the edge and take time to explore the park, buildings and distant open water by eye.Surprisingly there were relatively few people there. The kiosk is directly opposite the elevator (inside the 'trunk' of the nearest Supertree). We paid S$8/each for our tickets and, five minutes later, we had the walkway largely to ourselves. Lots of deck space at either end of the walkway where you gain access and then, one circuit 128 m later, where you return to the ground.In between there's this 'in-the-sky' feel about things given the uncluttered design of the walkway, chest-high open/netted sides topped by a handrail over which you can lean, width that varies between 1.5-3 m and oval/semi-circular curve that continues to point you in a different direction as you walk. No, there's no issue with 'height, exposure, apprehension, etc.' you can't for example, see through the deck beneath your feet.That said, leaning over the rail we lost a hat to the wind - watched it float down into a flower garden at the base of one of the Supertrees ' good no one would see it there; they didn't and 20 minutes later we rescued it.In the distance you can see across Marina Bay towards the Bay East Gardens and, further towards the sea, there's the Marina Barrage (where you can cross over to the other gardens). We were heading that way to visit the Sustainable Singapore Gallery (opened June 2018) and explore the development of water resources in the island.Key/final point ' there's no entry fee into the park ' gardens, lakes, children's play area too; you pay for entry into the specialized features ' conservatories, aerial walkway.Peter Steele10 November 2019",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r727120008-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

For a good spot (eg. lying down) to see the show, you may want to be there early (I saw people started waiting one hour ahead).The only complain I have is that the plant signs appear random and sporadic.

The flower gardens are a horticulturists dream, however was somewhat a disappointment for me as the representative garden of my country, South Africa in the Flower Dome was a poor reflection of a South African garden.The Cloud Dome however was more than made up for the disappointment in terms of concept and education.To properly experience all that these gardens and surrounding, requires between you need 6 to 8 hours. Plan to start latest 10am, wear good walking shoes as there is lots of ground to cover and along a sun hat or umbrella for sun protection.Take the paid tour around the garden to orient yourself and plan your next steps. The Gardens is more than just the Super Trees and the Domes. Make sure you stay to experience the 8pm light show. The gardens at night is a sight to behold.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/89/avatar010.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r724110121-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,Lorna-en,Beautiful and worth a visit,40,6-Nov-19,Lovely and unusal attraction. Would advise to give yourself plenty of time for your visit. There is much room for improvement as regards information and communication regarding tickets and last entry times. Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are sold as a combined ticket but the entrances are separate and if you come at night you may have to forefit one of these attractions as the last entry is at 8pm for both of these. There were multiple groups in this position when we arrived. Eventually a helpful staff member said we actually could enter up to 8.20pm which did allow us to do both.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e3/1f/default-avatar-2020-46.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r724083215-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,harleydoha,Visit In The Evening,40,3-Nov-19,"I visited the Gardens by the Bay last week. I strongly recommend you visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Dome in the evening time as it is more atmospheric. Be in the Cloud Dome by 2000hrs (8PM) as this is the last misting of the day, with the darkest and the mist makes it really a special visit. If you are frighten of heights would not recommend going all the way up to the seventh floor and walking out on the sky bridge. By the time you have completed your visit to the Domes you will be ready for the light show in the Super Tree Grove which commences at 2045hrs (8.45PM) another great event, the lights and music are very well matched.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/06/44/84/0d/andrew-d.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r723392956-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

It is well laid out, and you can take an electric buggy ride through the gardens. There are also 2 large cooled covered enclosures, the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, besides the OCBC (walking) Skyway, all 3 with ticketed entry. There is also a free open air ""Sound and Light Show"" at nights. I have seen 2 special shows in the Flower Dome, the Tulips Show and the Cherry Blossom Show, which were exquisite and most colourful.

Gardens by the Bay,HappyTravellerHK,Nice Attraction but Access Bottlenecks is a Concern,40,21-Oct-19,"Nice attraction. Well-designed but not cheap. While I agree with recommendations to go late afternoon to catch the light show when it gets dark (7:45 pm for 1st show), make sure you provide enough daylight time if you wish to go to the two main gardens. We ended up in the floral garden and it was too dark to appreciate it as they keep the lighting quite dim. We went on a Saturday and it was extremely crowded. It was designed to push the crowds through so it wasn't a long wait but it distracts from the nature appreciation aspects.The most disconcerting part are the massive bottlenecks along two narrow staircase on the path to get back to the Bayside MRT Station when everyone leaves after the light show. While the crowd during my visit was relatively well disciplined, it is a disaster waiting to happen if anything unusual occurs. The massive sway in the pedestrian bridge with a huge crowd was not the most pleasant.

Gardens by the Bay,aycs,Loved cloud forest,40,12-Oct-19,"The gardens themselves (without paying to go inside the domes) was spectacular in itself, but we still did go into Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. There's a 3rd, but we only wanted to do 2 of them and was told that if we only picked 2, it was these 2 that we could only do (I assume because the 3rd dome was further out). You can pick all 3 in a package which comes with a free ride on the golf buggy.We got there nice and early on a Monday and had breakfast there, before starting out. We did Cloud Forest first and found the dome nice and quiet - only a handful of other visitors. The place is so big, you don't really get in each other's way anyway. Bear in mind that the domes are climate controlled and it was very cool in both of them. The Cloud Forest begins with a misty waterfall, before you walk around and head up to the overhead walkway. The views around the gardens and outside through the dome windows were really cool. With the 2 kids, it took us about 40 minutes to complete the dome.Flower dome is located next to Cloud forest and when we entered about 10.30, it was very busy. The dome is broken up into different regions of the world and is very colourful, but I didn't find it as fun as I'm not a green thumb. There were plenty of colourful photo opportunities, but as it was very busy, it was a case of waiting for your turn, or waiting for the crowd to stop walking through.The park and the domes are very wheelchair and pram friendly - we didn't have a stroller, but noticed all the ramp and elevator options.Once we were done, we left by walking to the MRT station. It takes about 10 minutes (adult walk) and you get to walk through those gigantic trees you can see from afar. There's also a great opportunity to take photos of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Singapore Flyer.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/66/bc/83/aycs.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r717495656-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Julie S,Pros and Cons of day and night visit,40,20-Sep-19,Our tour included the option of the cloud visit or the gardens by the bay dome. Our guide said the waterfall at Singapore Airport was better than that in the cloud dome and unless you were interested in climate change the more 'Instagram friendly pics' would be in the gardens dome. Needless to say I think most of the tour party opted for the garden option.The subtle and elegant lighting made it look like a wonderful fairy grotto but in all honesty if you really want to see the Flora I think a day time well lit option might be better. That said the advantage of the evening if the wonderful light show outside to music. The treetop walk amongst the structures looked very exciting and would be great for photos so one to explore for a return trip I think,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0a/20/1e/5d/julie-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r711413671-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

The next step is to enjoy the Flower Dome + Cloud Forest with FREE timing. The Supertrees are the first things you will notice when approaching the Gardens. Unfortunately, the OCBC Skyway was closed for maintenance. The Flower Dome was less than what I expected, I could say that the Green Planet in Dubai is far more exciting to see (although smaller) and many comments say that the Botanical gardens of Singapore are more beautiful (I will visit this week). I seem to enjoy the Cloud Forest more; I loved the waterfall, the cooling atmosphere, and being on top of the mountain.

Well since they are air-conditioned, visitors would have to pay an entry fee but the rest of the garden is free for public to enjoy.I conducted an orientation program at the venue for my CCA and it was pretty successful as students get to be outside of school and learn some new things that they won't usually know about.

Afterward, we went for an early dinner at Marina Bay Sands which had plenty of dining options. The free light and music show at night was not bad, but not nearly as spectacular as others had suggested. It had a touch of Vegas vibe. My teenage daughter got bored halfway and wanted to leave.

Gardens by the Bay,lavender96229,Empowering your employees to deal with minor customer service issues,30,23-Jan-20,"Gardens by the Bay is a must see visit when in Singapore? My partner is in work assignment in Singapore and we go often.We decided to visit the lunar new year showcase on Tuesday Jan 21rst. One regular and one senior ticket requested. I had left home without my passport so I was unable to take advantage of said discount. I was flattered that they thought I did not qualify. That was a great January birthday present,My partner showed me the tickets for entry and one for shuttle. We proceed to shuttle. The staff at shuttle would not let us ride as we were two with one shuttle ticket. We showed our receipt that we paid for two passengers. She instructed us to go back to the entrance gate and Q again to get a second ticket. Then she also suggested walking about 20 steps to the ticket window and maybe they could help.We did that and at that window we were told we had to go back to the entrance ticket office and Q to get the second ticket. Frustrated we headed back to the original Q and saw the original agent.NOW THE MISSING SHUTTLE TICKET HAD A VALUE OF $1.75. We stated that we only got 1 ticket for 2 people. She said we lost the ticket. IN ESSENCE CALLING MY PARTNER A LIAR AND MAKING OUR MISSING TICKET OUR PROBLEM. UPON HEARING THAT I TOLD MY PARTNER TO GET A REFUND OF EVERYTHING.The gate agent refunded our flower dome tickets and what we paid for shuttle.In Essence walking two paying customers over a $1.75sgd Golf cart seat.This could have been easily been resolved in under 2 seconds.We showed the tram agent one ticket and a receipt for 2 paid seats on the tram. She could have simply let us board and made a note on the ticket. She could have then let the gate agent know what happened. The gate agent next to the shuttle could have done the same thing. She did not. The original agent could have issued a second ticket. Instead she said we lost it after telling her we never got it (guest is lying).SOMETIMES IT IS FORGOTTEN THAT AS A BUSINESS YOU ARE IN THE HOSPITALITY BUSINESS NOT THE HASSLE THE CUSTOMER BUSINESS.WE celebrated my January 20th belated birthday another way and still had a wonderful day.YOU ARE STILL THE BEST PLACE TO VISIT.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/3d/b7/ac/lavender96229.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r740627825-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Unfortunately, the Supertree Grove was not accessible due to the a ticket Christmas fair so we could only watch from the outside. The lightshow as ok, nothing to shout about but perhaps we missed the full experience not being closer and not being able to hear the music.We had dinner at Satay by the Bay. It was hot and smoky and my food from a seafood stall took so long to be ready that my companions had finished their food by the time mine arrived. I would not recommend eating here if you can help it.Upon leaving, we wanted to take a taxi but unfortunately the queue was so long and I overheard a guy asking a group of tourist in front of me if they wanted to take a private transfer as taxis could take at least an hour. All of the taxis I could see were either flashing ""On call"" or ""Shift Change"".So we decided to take a 20 min walk to the Bayfront MRT. What a mess it was, even to buy an MRT ticket. And the MRT staff who was supposed to be assisting didn't tell people in the queue that the ticketing machine only took $2 or $5 and we had to go and get a change. The MRT counter initially didn't want to assist in breaking up our $10 note, which would have left us stranded.All in all, have your transport game plan sussed out before visiting. and plan to eat before or after.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/7b/default-avatar-2020-56.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r735976516-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

The gardens are well kept and the cloud forest is amazing. The food, satay by the bay was fantastic(we had satay and chilli crab). But it was an absolutely nightmare to get a taxi to return to the hotel. We had to queue up for more than an hour to get the taxi. The other option was to pay more to get a taxi( S$50). We refused.

Gardens by the Bay,LizaNTrevor,Unsafe during large public events,30,31-Dec-19,We visited on Christmas eve 2019 for the Christmas light show. All i can say is that it is a massive security hazard waiting to be set off. There were throngs of people trying to leave at around 8 with lots more trying to get in via one staircase from the Gardens to the bridge leading to marina Bay Sands through one set of escalators down to the shopping complex. Just imagine the chaos if there was an incident that triggered a stampede.The show itself was nice but a bit repetitive. We werent told the ODBC skyway was closed at 4 so we would have to come back another day to that. The Flower dome was a bit ordinary but the Cloud Forest was great with fantastic architecture. The Skyway itself was short but we were fortunate to visit during a solar eclipse so spent time up there watching the eclipse. It's certainly unique enough to visit once and tick that off your list.

We were less than impressed with the domes at gardens by the bay. The flower done was basically the plants we grow in our garden (which are not native to Singapore) and the cloud dome was mildly interesting, but the crowds and wait times put us off. The free and public gardens did look like they were worth time and we would have gone back for an afternoon if we could have. We were there on the Sunday before Christmas and the crowds were unpleasant. We did see the Christmas display at night and the super tree light show which was impressive. If I was advising visitors, I would recommend finding out the slower times and I would question whether or not the domes are worth the entry fee. The super trees are worth seeing at night and the public park looks excellent.

Gardens by the Bay,970peters970,Disappointing,30,4-Nov-19,Told we had to see the laser and sound show around these giant cooling towers covered to look like S\F trees. Easy to find on Bayfront MRT station with an A\C walkway all way to the attraction. Got there with 5 minutes to spare had a good view but we were a bit disappointed as the sound was very quiet and the trees changed colour a few times. No laser lights to be seen but it does make a good evening stroll around marina bay with the iconic marina bay Sands hotel behind you with its three towers and the cantilevered whale across the top.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/de/e7/default-avatar-2020-37.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r723603782-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Shuttle, Cross a pedestrian bridge, into a mall, walk all the way to the end of the mall , out in the sun again to the end of the promenade... just to collect the tickets. That was definitely a Marketing PLOY for Red Dot Mesuem.

Gardens by the Bay,Laurence771,First visit to the Gardens by the Bay,30,15-Oct-19,"We decided to visit the Gardens by the Bay whilst staying in Singapore, being totally honest we were left slightly disappointed having paid $36 each to obtain entry into a couple of the exhibitions.The Floral Fantasy does have some very exotic and interesting flowers/plants as does the Flower Dome but it's not really worth the entrance fee.The Cloud Forest was unfortunately closed for maintenance, we didn't get a chance to walk around the public gardens as it was dark when the light show finished.The light show which is formed around and onto the Super trees is a great spectacle and was by far the best thing we saw and it's free, the show starts at 19.45 each evening and lasts for 15 minutes.My advice would be to walk around the vast public gardens during day light and then take in the Super Tree light show both free of charge.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/bf/22/61/laurence771.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r718446095-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

This was the highlight of my trip to the gardens. I purchased tickets through Klook which was very easy to use. The dome with the waterfall had about an hour wait. the line looped for so long that we opted to skip it. We spent about 3 hours there + another hour waiting for our entrance time to get to the skywalk. We went after the 8:45 show time and the trees were beautiful at night.I suggest to be prepared to stay longer than 3 hours especially when it's crowded and if you want to take breaks, sit down in the garden, wander around. 2-3 hours to visit the domes and skywalk.If you have a hard time walking like I did, then buy the pass that includes the shuttle (airport cart type of transit) since it's a bit of a walk to get from entrance points to the domes.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/01/cb/76/98/facebook-avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r716853823-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,WhyLikeDat,"Not so wheelchair friendly at Flower Dome, Gardens by the Bay",30,6-Oct-19,"Went to the Flower Dome on Saturday 5 Oct 6pm - hubby on wheelchair. It was good that we did not need to join the very long queue but realised it was not so easy to manoeuvre the wheelchair because of the slope downwards dragging the wheelchair along and the crowd. The upper level was more greenery than flowers. The lower level was so crowded that it was not easy to get a good picture taken with the flowers, as the wheelchair was bulky. As a result, we finished 'viewing' in about 30 minutes. Exiting was an issue as we could not see the sign and ended up joining the queue to the Cloud Dome. When the usher was asked, she gave the wrong instructions not meant for a wheelchair and we ended up in the souvenir shop again, looking for an exit. Had to ask another staff again and she said to take the lift up and it took some searching through the crowd to spot the lift at the Cloud Dome queueing area. It would be great if a flyer with instructions for wheelchair users is given.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/59/default-avatar-2020-49.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r715674336-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,Scott S,One Big Tourist Attraction,30,4-Oct-19,"The first thing to know about Gardens By The Bay is that it is one massive tourist attraction. It has highly constructed facilities that you can pay to go into, plus it has large gardens, ponds, and even a few aquariums around the property that are offered free of charge.For many, they find this location a great place to spend time with the family. It is also a good place to get in a little exercise and walk and/or run around.Personally, for those of us who know what this area of Singapore used to be like... Meaning, those of us who are a little bit older, we may remember what this area previously was, once upon a time. For me, that was a much more ascetically pleasing period of time in Singapore. This is not to say that Gardens By The Bay is not a great place but I am just saying that it lacks any true Singaporean culture.So, go here if you want to interact with a lot of tourists and see some marginally interesting tourist attractions.

Gardens by the Bay,memories137,Disappointing,30,23-Jul-19,"We visited here with our family on our last day in Singapore. Given time constraints due to flights we thought a Cloud Forest experience would be best.On arrival at the ticket office we were told we had to buy a combined Cloud Forest and Flower Dome ticket despite explaining we did not have time to visit both.The queue to enter the Forest was not too bad, although maintaining any form of personal space was almost impossible! Our first view of the Forest was lovely but this is also where things started to go downhill.We were herded into lifts to reach the top floor which was challenging if you are at all claustrophobic. On reaching the top floor there were large numbers of people and it was difficult to see anything without being bumped or pushed. Any hope of finding a quiet spot to take in the surroundings was impossible. Floating walkways take you down each level where you can view the many differing plants and also views of Singapore. The walkway may be difficult if you have a fear of heights.On one level there is an educational section with film show explaining mans' global impact but most people just walked through without stopping. A real educational opportunity missed!!Really the sheer numbers going through the forest at one time completely spoiled the experience for our party of 7. Collectively we agreed we would have had a more enjoyable experience just walking through the gardens and enjoying the evening light show which we just caught the end of.Surprisingly, the toilets near the ticket desk at the Cloud Forest were not very clean.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/86/31/83/memories137.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r691918633-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

The other dome is more inspiring with a lovely waterfall and a fabulous walkway and plant selection.However however in this world we live in, we always compare to prior experiences and I have to compare to Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew in Richmond England and The Eden project in Exeter area of England...both are so much more spectacular, real and take your breath away that's it's difficult to be impressed by the Singapore experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/77/ae/default-avatar-2020-2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r689723004-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

However having vacated our table at 8 pm we were most surprised to find many available tables at this time.Every table has a nice view, and seating is comfortable.The food, whilst pleasant , is either luke warm or cold as everyone seem to have food served on cold plates. The drinks are the same price as elsewhere in Singapore but the food is a little more expensive but you're paying for fabulous views.All in all, I would suggest that you drink here and eat elsewhere.

The garden in itself was very pretty and had a nice climate controlled atmosphere. However there was some manga event being held there and it was the last day of the sakura trees exhibition. I think this largely contributed to the place being just too crowded. To the point where I wanted to leave after about half hour. The management really shouldn't allow these special events to take place over the weekend and if they must, then close it to the public. They also need to look into controlling the number of people that can be at any given area at one time. In the event of a fire, it would've been total mayhem!

Though same are available for buying at the property also.

There was an array of food stores from nachos to chicken in a cone. We had already had dinner before going through so we didn't try any of the food but the beers were cold and did flow.There was snow machine which really added to the Christmas spirit.The queues were too long to go up to the walk way to walk between the lights.

Gardens by the Bay,LauK299,Concrete Garden,30,20-Dec-18,"This so called ""garden"" is highly manicured and man made, If you are a urbanite coming from a 3rd world city with an abundance of slums , this would be a garden paradise, If you come from lands where true nature is pervasive then you would find these gardens contrived and touristy . Don't go after the sun sets because finding yr way around can be a nightmare as signage is bad and lighting is dim. If you only have time for one garden, head for the Botanic Gardens instead , It's a real garden . Their fancy special shows inside the Flower dome are quite underwhelming especially if you have already seen tulips in Holland , Cherry blossoms in Japan etc",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/ce/default-avatar-2020-7.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r640538847-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,Andreas I,"gardens good, flower dome not good, cloud forest good",30,17-Dec-18,"The gardens themselves are beautiful. They are outside, very big and free. There are volunteers to whom we can ask questions about orientation of our visits as the place is immense. We enjoyed walking outside in the gardens. But when it comes to the indoor domes, the ticket was in my opinion pretty expensive. 28 SGD per person for 2 attractions: flower dome and cloud forest. We first visited flower dome and I have to say we were disappointed. There weren't too many flowers, inside there were a big show of Christmas trees and desert plants. The cloud forest was good, with the giant waterfalls, orchid inside, nephentes plants, it was beautifully conceived, wonderful even. Before going here, we suggest you to visit first the Singapore Botanical Garden, that's free of admission and its Orchid Garden ($5 per person). In term of value for money, I found it superioir than Gardens By the Bay. Still, Gardens By The Bay is a must visit place in Singapore. Spend more time in gardens outside and cloud forest. Flower dome just see and get out, not worth it.

My guess is that we would have enjoyed it more if we had gone during the day. It was also super crowded, but that may have been due to the Christmas displays.

Even if you had no interest in the 'winter wonderland'. Then they hadn't bothered to change their signs so every direction we went in to try to get to the mrt was blocked off.

Gardens by the Bay,Foodie_Traveller_MR,A quiet place in a busy city,30,12-Nov-18,"If you've been to Singapore you know that it's a bustling metropolis. Combine that with the extraordinary heat and humidity of being so close to the equator and you can quickly need an escape. Gardens by the Bay was that retreat for me.The public park was built as a gift to the population of Singapore as part of the deal to build the Marina Bay Sands and associated casino. While it has the normal trappings of a public park such as ponds, statues and lushl tropical gardens... prepare for a typically Singaporean twist.At the centre of the gardens the 'super trees' are vast constructions with ecology at their centre. They conceal the equipment that helps to serve the local buildings with cool air. They have solar panels for green power generation. They are planted out with diverse species of plants throughout their vast structure. So successful are these green projects, that species of birds that had long since fled Singapore have now returned to nest in their eco-cyber boughs.There is a bar at the top of one of the trees that provides stunning views across the park. You can get a similar view by taking the walk along the bridge that spans between the super trees. Be aware that these will shut during inclement weather. Due to the large amount of lightening you get in Singapore, this can be annoyingly frequent. Also, you don't get much for free in Singapore, so while exploring at ground level is free, be prepared to pay for everything else. It's for this reason that I have to drop the score.By far my best experience at the Gardens by the Bay was the nightly musical and light spectacular. The whole garden, principally lit by the magnificent super trees pulse in a choreographed mix of colourful lights that match the accompanying music. Make sure that you look it up, I was surprised by the number of people, even locals, who didn't know about this (absolutely free) event.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/15/49/c9/9e/caption.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r632580013-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

I can appreciate that other cultures and societies don't have such flowers - and I could see the joy that the flowers were bringing to the other visitors - but I was honestly disappointed. I then went to the Cloud Dome and walked in to see the artificial waterfall.

So I was left with only the other option, the Flower Dome.This proved a mistake as there was, firstly, inane muzak piping on a loop non-stop which was extremely irritating. Secondly, there were way too many people-again, concentrated in a single, closed setting.All in all, the visit was spoilt for me, despite the interesting plants and flowers in an air-conditioned setting.Then, it was off to the overhead walkway and after shelling out S$8, went up with a whole elevator load of people with their babies and children and pushcarts.If you think you will find peace and quiet here, this is definitely NOT the place for it.There was also surprisingly very little varied bird life in the outside areas. I saw the ubiquitous mynahs, pigeons, crows and doves. With a Sunda Pygmy Woodpecker-which made my day; and water monitor lizard thrown in for good measure.I would suggest the Management provides means for public feedback to make much needed improvements.An experience not to be repeated.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/08/81/81/e4/poo-lin-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r611113075-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

The smell inside the domes is very pleasant and the aircon makes it a refuge from the intense Singapore heat. It took us just over an hour to walk around both domes.

Due to the fact that its a REAL garden/park definitly adds a lot of worth. Asides from all the trees, woods, forrests etc there were also big green grassy areas where you could just sit down and relax.

What kind of garden is that?It started to really bother me because the gardens claim to be environmentally conscious however there is just so much unneeded, brought in material to a place that is beautiful for nature not construction.I found the attractions really boring. After about an hour I really wanted to just leave and go do something else. Unless you're really fascinated by botany, it's probably just going to be a quick stop.I hate to leave an average review on one of the highest rated gardens of the world but I have seen gardens in New Zealand, kept by personal property that had more magic happening than this tourist attraction.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/0f/00/ac/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r585221104-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Yogesh B,Not SO great. Should visit if there is enough spare time.,30,2-Jun-18,We visited the two artificial domes (flower & cloud) at the Gardens By the Bay area. To cover these two attractions and the light show (around 7 pm) in the evening one needs 1/2 day. Flower dome is better than Cloud Dome. Nothing great in Cloud Dome. And if you plan to visit National Orchid Garden then you can skip the Flower Dome too. Better to go to Gardens By the bays area just to watch the evening light show. And if you have very less time then watch the laser light show at Marina Bay Sands rather than watching the light show at the Gardens By the Bay area.

Gardens by the Bay,CheyColbourne,Light show is amazing but entrance to the conservatories isn't worth it.,30,29-May-18,"We had wanted to view the light show, so decided to arrive 2 hours early and use our City Sightseeing pass to go into the Conservatories (Cloud Forest and Flower Conservatory).The conservatories weren't worth the money or the time.We went into the Cloud Forest first, waiting 30 minutes to go inside (which we thought was a pretty good waiting time), only to find that when we got inside there was another hour and a half wait to go in the lift to the walkways. We would have missed the light show if we had waiting in line, so decided to just walk around the 'ground floor' which took a grand total of 7 minutes.We then went into the Flower Conservatory which was fine, but the displays were being changed so most of the flowers/hanging baskets were just on the floor (yet we still paid full price!). Especially not worth it if you're English because you'll find most of the flowers in your garden (minus a palm tree or two).Regardless, the light show was absolutely stunning and we would absolutely watch this again.In short, save your money and just watch the free light show.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/68/18/97/cheycolbourne.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r583648452-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,binduAustralia,"Enjoyed the Cloud Forest, the Flower dome ' not so much",30,24-Mar-18,"One of the features of the Singapore skyline, the Gardens by the Bay super trees are a notable element of the Gardens by the Bay. There are public gardens, a multi-storey Cloud forest (easily accessible via lifts, escalators, etc.) and a large low-level flower dome. There is a light show (not amazing) in the evening.The Cloud Forest features a large waterfall and an ambling walk around the perimeter of lush tropics, green gardens. There are some interesting stalactite's and stalagmites on display (wonder how they were removed from their original sports and transported!), and interest sculptures fashioned from polished and worked timber.We were perhaps unlucky with the timing of our visit to the Flower dome as they were readying it for what promised to be a very busy cherry blossom festival and we were left with displays being reworked and some pretty dreary and uninteresting displays.There was also a big function on in the function room which is part of the Flower Dome and the high-tech presentations taking place didn't add to the atmosphere. Also the skywalk wasn't operating.It's an expensive visit and while it was worth seeing it wouldn't be on the ""see-again"" list unless there was a very significant special exhibition taking place. Plenty of shops, a few restaurants and afterwards we decided to follow the signs to the satay club which turned out to be an excellent food complex with a range of eating places, but certainly a much further walk than the signs suggested.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/4e/67/4b/binduaustralia.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r568370754-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

This cost us another $8 per adults you can either claim the stairs ( I think there was 103 stairs) or take the lift up the view were wonderful. The big tree has a restaurant in it which opens for lunch and dinner. ( you should book this) the menu looked good lots of different foods to choose from, we didn't eat there. We went up to the roof top to have a look around and then to the bar area to have a cold drink. For us to go up it cost us $12 per person for a glass of soft drink or juice I think if you wanted wine etc it cost $24.I really wanted to look inside the 2 Conservatory ( flower dome and the cloud forest ) but seeing the standard rate was $28.00 per adult to go into both I decided to leave I had already spent $28 on me and there was 3 of us.

Particularly the waterfall-dome - where we had to queue for 30 minutes to get up with the elevator - fell short of my expectations. The round-walks are rather short and not that exciting.

Gardens by the Bay,BKYTHAM,Visit during Christmas Wonderland,30,7-Jan-18,"The Christmas lights were wonderful. However, to appreciate the gardens and its surroundings, visitors should visit the gardens during the day. The Cloud Forest and Flower Dome garden night lights were too dim and hence we are unable to see clearly the exhibits and hence we were unable to appreciate the gardens and its surroundings. Unless, you are at the gardens to see the Christmas lights and the decorations I advise visitors to visit it during the daytime. On the day of the visit the crowd was too large at the Christmas Wonderland. By the time we got to the OCBC Skyway the gate was closed. The organiser should have extended the opening hours of the OCBC Skyway so that everyone get the opportunity to experience the scenic stroll on the skyway. By the way the closing time was 9.00pm (a bit too early for such an occasion where they are many visitors to the gardens).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r552136590-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Service at Pollen was appalling, the staff didn't look interested in manning the entrance to guide customers into the cafe despite empty tables. The queue for Mc Donald's was out the door and stretched for quite abit.

Flower dome - don't see a lot of flora n fauna even there are a lot of different gardens. Almost everyone keep taking photos of the decorations instead of getting know the plants which may not be common - as there wasn't any special plants to get to know.

Gardens by the Bay,dane158,Gimmicky tourist trap,30,24-Nov-17,"Gardens by the Bay are a fun attraction, but super gimmicky and touristy. The indoor flower garden was a waste for me, especially considering the city has its own i) botanical gardens (which are great) and ii) the general priority on having green spaces everywhere. The waterfall (forest?) one is worth visiting if you want to do one of the two, but would only give a soft recommendation on the whole complex.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f0/9f/default-avatar-2020-16.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r542934267-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,Maartje Z,"Cloud Forest yes, Flower Dome meh",30,23-Nov-17,"Gardens by the Bay is one of Singapore's highlights. It gives you the opportunity to visit two different experiences inside of two domes. You can choose to go to both or just one.If you have a lack of time (or money) I would recommend to only visit the Cloud Forest. The Flower Dome is nice and has some cool trees, but if you're from Europe this dome will not be that special since many trees and plants are from Europe.However, I liked the Cloud Forest very much! The eye-catching artificial waterfall (with artificial clouds as well) is very impressive to see and gives a good opportunity to make photo's. Next to that, this garden is filled with the tropical flowers and plants, which I expected to see in the flower dome. There is not that much to see and you can be finished pretty fast, but it definitely is a nice experience.Tip: bring a jacket or cardigan. Compared to the artificial tropical gardens back in Europe, it is very cold at Gardens by the Bay.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/20/default-avatar-2020-31.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r542748872-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,sdbike,Time of Year is Very Important for The Flower Emporium,30,19-Nov-17,"I visited here in May of 2015 and found the Wold of Flowers blooming with abundance and color. I took more pictures of flowers that day than I have in my life and some of them turned out to be real winners. It was fascinating to learn all about them and see them in all their glory. With that in mind, visiting Singapore again in November 2017, with my 33 yr old nephew, I was excited to show him as well. Upon entering it, I could see they had it decorated for Christmas and exceedingly so. So much that I did not really see any flowers stand out. Apparently this time of year, only about an 1/8 of the flowers I saw in May of 2015 were on display in Nov of 2017. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. As well as all of the tourists posing for selfies and not letting you see the flowers, it was not a successful visitation. I would not recommend this at all for anyone at this time of year. Even the holiday decorations were a little over the top so not exactly warm and fuzzy. I wish I could have given it a good review as I loved it the last time, but I had to apologize to my nephew for building up his excitement for this attraction only to be very disappointed.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r541870731-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

It's the least you can do to provide these convenience because poor tourists and locals like myself had to resort to sitting at the steps and what not.

But frankly, I was impressed but not floored. The reeling effect of real nature - with its manifold facets and unpredictability - is missed with such ventures. Artificial gardens don't bring people towards nature but create more disengagement of man and the wild. Two domes - heavily air conditioned for artificial ""atmosphere"" - is no way fo telling mankind that we care for nature ! Good for awareness and propaganda but not for REAL thing! Lets say - we can't manufacture nature - and that's exactly what we are trying to do here.One more thing- this attraction involves a lot of physical labour and is not suitable for very young children and seniors. The domes are quite artificially colder and there is a huge mismatch between the outer and inner climates.

Perhaps, they need to create a theme for the light and sounds show.

So please do check before you book anything in advance.Waiting for the rest of my party to come, I took my son to explore the playground by the water play area just in front of the entrance to the actual Garden and he absolutely loved it. The water play area was a bit crowded but seem like a lot of fun. So, do come prepare with swimming gears and change of clothes if you are with kids. And the plus side is that this area is free!We ate at one of the cafes scattered around the Garden. There are several of them. Food was quick and decent.The waterfall was impressive. The temperature in the dome was much cooler (and wetter) than I had expected. You get to ride the elevator to the top and decent down along the walkways. Seeing the Garden at night gave you a totally different feeling from daytime. It was more futuristic and Avartar-like.It was a shame that we had to rush though everything (even the giftshop!) as they were closing.There were long lines for taxi as we exited, but with Grab, we got our taxi within 5 mins.

Gardens by the Bay,Heseriwa,Cooler from below,30,16-Oct-17,I personally thought that paying S$8/pp to go up to the skywalk was a bit of a waste of money.

Gardens by the Bay,Savannah020,Not your average botanical garden,30,15-Oct-17,"The Garden's Grove consists of the Flower Dome and the Cloud dome. All in all I'd have to say I found the Cloud Dome more impressive than the Flower Dome. Upon entering the Cloud dome you see a big waterfall. Then you take the elevator to the top floor, and walk the way down through various exhibitions and gardens. The flower dome takes you through different gardens with various themes and from different locations. I was impressed by the Cloud Dome, after which the Flower Dome felt a bit anti-climactic. Perhaps it would be wise to visit the Flower Dome first, as tickets can not be bought separately, unless you are a resident of Singapore.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/27/c0/09/savannah020.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r533082201-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Lisaangmoh,Cool rainforest with big waterfall,30,3-Oct-17,Gardens By the Bay is a great place to visit if you like plants/gardens. 2 huge domes house 1. the cool rainforest with a big waterfall and 2. a flower garden which actually has cacti and big trees too. The latter has changing displays based usually on the season too. It is great to visit but too hot to see the outside gardens but these are less of an attraction. There is a light show at night amongst the super trees and a suspended walk between them you can (pay) to do during the day.

Nothing different than usual flower shows.Tree top walk gives you great view of garden bay and u can get good pictures here. Its best in evening where towers changes colours.

I actually preferred the jungle more Southeast/East of them, where the apiary and exotic birds are.BTW, the outdoor skywalk is not worth it (also IMHO).The gift store was full of heavily overpriced merchandise and pushy salespeople. There were very nice things, but 70%+ of the stuff in there I felt I needed to haggle over.Put on your walking shoes, because the foot travel here almost reaches Disneyland territory.

Gardens by the Bay,speeddolphin,A wheelchair access review: All great but avoid Cloud Dome,30,7-Sep-17,"I had friends visiting from the US, but had broken my ankle so we decided to do this with me in a wheelchair. We visited the Flower Dome, Cloud Dome and had dinner at Satay by the Bay.For someone in a wheelchair, the air conditioned domes are a wonderful respite from the Singapore heat. The Flower Dome has great access - the slopes are gentle and you can pretty much see everything from the wheelchair. There was a portion accessible only by a flight of stairs, and there was a nifty looking machine to bring you up if I wanted. Needless to say, the kids really wanted me to try it.What surprised me was the Cloud Dome. I only found 1 lift to negotiate the different levels. The suspended walkways are broad enough for the wheelchair, but there were many levels that required traveling on the escalators. Given that the 1 lift was used by parents with prams, and wheelchairs like mine, it took so long for me to get anywhere, I eventually gave up and decided to wait for my friends at the ground level. To my horror, the final lift down to the ground floor brought me OUT of the Dome, and I had to backtrack to meet my friends before coming back out again. Let's just say it was not ideal, especially compared to how wheelchair friendly the rest of the Gardens was. If you have someone in your party in a wheelchair, you might want to think twice about going to the Cloud Dome.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/04/66/0e/bc/speeddolphin.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r522181430-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

It starts at 8pm and there is seating around the trees where the show takes place. A hint - get there 30 minutes ahead of time if you want to sit, otherwise you will stand or sit on the ground.The Flower Tower was disappointing.

Gardens by the Bay,AlexRexx,If you love flowers and Aircon...,30,6-Sep-17,The Outdoor garden itself is free but it's boring. What's interesting is the flower domes but those require you to pay an admission fee. I wouldn't consider giving this a try unless you want to visit the domes. They have different exhibits throughout the year so you might want to plan your schedule based on the type of event going on.

As you walk, you will see the towering Marina Bay Sands across the road as well as the Singapore Flyer and the Supertrees.

Gardens by the Bay,Xavier722013,Gardens by Bay - what to watch out for,30,1-Sep-17,"So, it all depends where you come from and what excites you. There are two domes. One which is 'tropically' themed i.e. Vegatation, plants and flowers from the ecuator and tropics and and other one which is northern. My family and I (and an 10 yr old girl and 12 yr old boy) are from Switzerland and the U.K. so seeing the dome with northern vegatation, edelweiss flowers etc was not really a thrill. We are an outdoor family so none of this was particularly unusual or special for us. However this was very very popular with Asian families. The other tropical dome was in contrast very interesting for us. So it really all comes down to where you come from, what you are familiar with. As the old adage goes: ""it's all in the eye of the beholder"".On another note, we were all left feeling rather sad after visiting. Garden by the Bay have an Orwellian feeling to it. Everything is so organized, perfectly manicured and slightly 'artificial'. Hopefully we don't destroy the world so much that we end up only being able to see some of this fascinating flora in places like this.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e9/ef/default-avatar-2020-66.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r520106150-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

It's not cheap and the walk on the elevated boardwalk is pretty poor value.

It was lovely and cool by the waterfall too!.When we came out it was 8:10! Still enough time to see the orchid garden then (as I stated before-last admissions at 8:30) it would however have meant that we had to pay full price again rather than discount for 2...... the ticket office was closed!?!!!!!

Gardens by the Bay,dhui,yet to improve,30,28-Jun-17,"I purchased tickets for the 2 domes, the flower dome was the one worth visiting. I would suggest one might drop the cloud dome. As there was not much to see, except for the water fall and the ""sky walk"", that's all.for the flower dome, they did provide the audio guide (with a fee). I regretted on not getting it, as they did not put signage introducing the plants! And I got to know about the audio guide thing only after I was admitted.It was quite a hassle if to return back to customer service office to get it. The ticketing staff should have mentioned, or there should be signage placed at dome's entrance.The flower dome was a nice garden, people were allowed to roam around freely. I would rather they suggested a routing for people to go. There were tours at 11am and 3pm. I checked with staff for the 3pm tour (at 2:55pm), they asked me to wait in front of the signage, when more people started to gather, we were told the tour was started already! I wished they could be more organized!both domes were well-ventilated, a very comfortable environment in fact.Just if you are with kids or elderly, the walk from MRT / bus to the ticketing office was quite something. The walk might take you 20-25 mins (under the sun). Be prepared for it.admission for adults for 2 domes was charged at $28, and one might worth exploring the 1-year membership offer (now $34, was $68).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/11/82/69/0c/dhui.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r496845603-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,Joyce D,Where wonder blooms,30,27-Jun-17,"Amazed by the presentation of the beauty of nature. Perfect for kids. My 6 year old sister just kept on wow-ing at the sightof the falls, landscape, plants, flowers, and tge supertrees.What I was looking for though after appreciating their beauty were the names of the flowers and interesting facts about them. Though, there were some scattered around, I hoped each kind flower was given space for interesting facts about them.When we came this June 2017, the flower dome featured the Blue Beauties from the Australian, South African, English gardens. We were told then that the previous one had cherry blossoms of East Asia and the one before that were the tulips of Holland. Definitely would want to come back for these if I still dont have the budget to see the real thing hehe.It's a really nice place for nature lovers because almost all, if not all, plants and flowers in a specific season are here! For those who havent been in a place with a lot of flowers, this would be a nice introduction to the real scenes! :)Hope I didnt confuse anyone. I'm not saying they're not real.

Gardens by the Bay,korm_13,Impressive structures but oddly lifeless....,30,26-Jun-17,"One cannot help but be impressed by the enormous time, effort, money and engineering expertise that must have gone into building this massive indoor garden, but the result is weirdly sterile. I did not see a single insect in the entire place, and the effect was one of lifelessness, as if the plants were more sculpted than cultivated. Moreover, both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are so heavily air conditioned that after an hour inside each I was cold and glad to leave. I wondered whether the air con is for patrons' benefit or to maintain the plants in optimum condition (presumably the former; wouldn't the plants do better in a slightly steamier environment?). Within the Flower Dome, there were a few signs informing patrons what each plant was, but not enough of them. The date palms were very beautiful, but looked almost as though they had been assembled by hand. The assortment of dining venues were poor in quality and overpriced.

This recent visit was to the Cloud Forest and to see the Gardens turns 5 celebratory performances.Needless to say, the free Gardens turns 5 performances have attracted a huge crowd as it has been widely advertised and is free for all to view. However, sad to say, the crowd control inside Cloud Forest (which is a ticketed area) was disastrous. There was massive human traffic build up at every level of the Cloud Forest, making it uncomfortable to walk and noisy. The Cloud Forest is beautiful but we found the experience to be extremely disappointing simply because it was impossible to appreciate what it has to offer.

Which is very troublesome as we need to go back to our own country on next day.As for the staff, we asked if the ticket could be changed to other entrance (flower dome to the flower tower or something) and its ok to top up if needed but they just said no and asked us go back to the agent to ask for refund. If we have the time for that, we wouldnt have asked you for this request.

Gardens by the Bay,keithY651,We are glad we went but.......,30,6-Mar-17,"It was a wet afternoon and so it seemed a good choice. Singapore is an easy city to get round, plentiful and cheap taxis. The architecture of the place is amazing. However we left feeling that there was something missing. It was pretty crowded with the Asian tendency for selfies at every flower that does become tedious. Many of the flowers were in small pots similar to the ones you buy at a garden centre. It is also cool under the glass, certainly not what we expected and it is also pretty expensive to get in. The waterfall is great and the walk in the cloud forest is good too. There is minimal signage and for me too much chrome and not enough nature. We were looking forward to it but for us, it never delivered the experience anticipated.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/16/05/5f/c8/keithy651.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r464887560-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,vmile,Who or where is viator?,30,5-Mar-17,"The tour itself was wonderful BUT . . . First I booked on line which went smoothly enough until the site said there were limited hotel pickups. Nowhere on the site did it mention which hotels these were so undaunted and somewhat hopefully filled in my credit card details and hoped we were one of the chosen few. We weren't! So a day later Viator emailed me with an address as to where we could pick up the tour, at the coach pickup at the gardens by the bay at 6:30. With help from the concierge at the hotel we left with plenty of time to find the drop off or pickup point. Nobody T the gardens knew of Viator so we sat at the spot and waited and waited, stalking anybody who looked likely. Eventually I spied a lady with RMG tours who looked like she might know about a competing travel company and help us out. Low and behold our na,es were on her list. We were going on a RMG tour. If it had been up to my husband who would never have asked we would never have known.

Gardens by the Bay,milkcandies,Mixed feelings about this attraction,30,2-Mar-17,"Went on a Sunday to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest with much anticipation since I've heard good reviews about.The Flower Dome was pretty much a let down as I was anticipating to be wowed by a plethora of beautiful vintage blooming colors. But no... what I saw were mainly green and the flowers were not aplenty. Nothing much to take photographs of. We finished walking in like 15mins albeit trying to take our time already. I guess it would make more sense to visit the Flower Dome when there's special flower seasons like tulips etc... just my guess.The Cloud Forest welcomed us with a waterfall - nice. We walked around and up to the lost world. Wanted to take the lift up since I'm pregnant but was curtly turned away by the attendant who told us to take the stairs as we walked towards the lift. My husband didn't like that, but I later saw the sign that the lift is only for elderly and people carrying kids. Though I too think they should allow expecting women to use the lift too and the staff attitude was a little off. The plants were a sight; but that's about it. There's a crystal display but it's nothing impressive.Overall, there is no wow factor in both the domes. It was like paying $20 for just a walk in the park.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/c6/d1/5d/milkcandies.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r463989951-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,River R,Needs better announcement for Display Change,30,2-Mar-17,"I am sure any other time the Flower Dome would have been nice, just not last Monday. The counter didnt tell us that the dome was in the middle of display change. This will have made us change dates. There were no flowers except sunflowers, which were on their way of wilting. All this time of visits to Singapore, this was our first time here, and so while we enjoyed the greenery, the cactus and trees and sculptures, we were hoping for flowers, amazing blooms, since tag line says, 'forever spring,' or some such, in exchange for our 14 SGD. This wasn't so. There was an apologetic waiver inside, but how to refund when you have already gotten in? I am sure for many who haven't been to the botanical gardens will be amazed and all, but we simply cannot enjoy a flower dome without flowers. The poster advertising was, is, also incredibly misleading. Where are those blooms? The walk to the supertrees were incredibly worth it though at 8 SGD, and with discount, at 6 SGD. Will probably come back next time, and see about those blooms, but for everyone else, be mindful of any waiver. Also call counter ahead for when the domes close. The announcement, e.g., cloud forest, is on the website. Tip: Many of the attractions in Singapore close on a Monday, so be sure to check ahead of visit.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/4a/default-avatar-2020-42.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r463941951-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

But there are interesting exhibits in the 2 paid-entry enclosures. So everyone goes for the SuperTrees, personally I'm not so impressed with man-made structures for a nature-driven attraction. So this feels more like a garden theme park than anything. F&B is expensive for what they serve and a bit contrived. Walk further afield for Satay by The Bay, much cheaper, somewhat authentic local fare.If anyone wanted to see flora in Singapore, I'd first recommend the Botanical Gardens, not so much this place.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0e/27/1d/b5/beboptang.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r457251032-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

A/C temperature is only around 16c degree. What did make us feel even worse? No warning on the website or before entering the gardens. Given the huge difference of temperature, a coat is definitely needed for kids and/or adult if you want to spend 1-2 hours inside.We understand that such chill environment is needed to cater the plants from other continents. Cannot you simply put a warning/notification at the entry point and website?But, why I still gave a three stars? The outdoor gardens saved the trip.

Having been lucky enough to have visited one or two actual rainforests yes, a great place to educate the youngsters and experience the feeling ,but rather too on the commercial side for me .Quite a lot of walking to the shuttle in steamy hot conditions but please do not take my word for it, as flower and plant enthusiasts may be blown away!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/7c/default-avatar-2020-29.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r452041249-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

We didn't go in the conservatories so can't give an opinion on what's in there, but if you want a nice walk round some lovely tidy and colourful gardens then go for a stroll round the Royal Botanical Gardens.

You can walk around the gardens for free with no ticket and the most impressive part is the super tree grove which you can see for free by just walking over to it, definitely worth going to have a look at night when they are all lit up its very pretty but that's about it.

The only bits that need a ticket are the domes and the bridge so you can just wonder in when you have a bit of free time.The only reason iv given it a 3 is it was all a bit commercial for me. Had more of a Disney feel than botanical gardens but that said it was still worth going.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r448855025-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,ainaksan,Beautiful but..,30,2-Jan-17,Visited the Christmas wonderland this year with my friends around 10:30pm. We still had to pay 6 dollars to enter and enjoy for only 30 mins. It's only free entry after 11pm. My question is: is there a need for an entrance fee to see the lights only?

Gardens by the Bay,PGHRNZ,Interesting gardens,30,1-Jan-17,Staying nearby we wandered through the gardens on a very hot and humid day.The kids enjoyed the sculptures and waterwaysWe did not look in the domes and the price was (in our opinion) prohibitive and the queues long.Unfortunately we could not access the sky walk as there was a Christmas show that made it inaccessible.,https://static.tacdn.com/img2/generic/site/no_user_photo-v1.gif,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r448164692-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,How-Shoong,Choice for one day trip to Singapore,30,30-Dec-16,"I had one day to spare so decided to visit this top attraction in Singapore.Excellent attraction, beautifully landscaped and nice restaurants.A visit to the double conservatories is highly recommended, however, it can get quite cold if the weather is overcast so do bring a sweater or jacket to be comfortable.We wanted to go onto the OCBC Skyway but a Christmas Wonderland event surrounding the skyway meant that we had to pay for the entrance to the Christmas Wonderland event in addition to the skyway. We felt this was a rip off as we were not interested in the Christmas Wonderland event, so we decided to skip the skyway.Other than that, it was a nice experience.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/15/5e/88/62/how-shoong.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r447617052-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,leemichell,A nice attraction which is let down by poor customer service,30,29-Dec-16,"We wanted to visit the Gardens by the Bay at night in order to enjoy the illuminated Supertree Grove, and walk the OCBC skywalk.Unfortunately, the skywalk was closed due to the wet weather. However, we were told that we would not be permitted to enter anyway, as we had not purchased entry to the Christmas event that was being held around the trees after 3.00pm. Entry to this event could only be purchased online, and is a separate cost to the entry to the Garden and to the OCBC Skywalk. This seems to be a common theme in Singapore - there are add on costs for everything.The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are great and well worth the visit. But be warned that if you purchase tickets for the shuttle bus in the evening, you will not be given a ride back if you stay in the conservatories or gift shop until the 9.00 closing time. The last bus back to the entry is 8.45. The ticket sellers do not advise this - we were all left to walk back in the rain whilst we watched all the buses being driven back empty to park for the night. Very poor for a world class attraction.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/23/default-avatar-2020-28.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r447475601-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,bavarianbutterfly,Only interesting for those with no experirnce of tropical forests,30,29-Dec-16,I was rather disappointed with this attraction and felt I had seen so much more beauty in other tropical forest environments that I have seen in Southeast Asia. The technical aspects of the domes were interesting and some plants in the flower dome were fascinating to see but for me not worth the time and money fighting one's way through the throngs of people visiting them.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r447444190-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,PappanMajumdar,Highly overrated and well marketed tourist spot,30,29-Dec-16,"Definitely it does not deserve to be the No. 1 in Singapore Things To Do...I feel its little bit of a farce and a very well marketed activity. It mainly consists of Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, the Supertrees, other garden areas and OCBC Skyway. Out of these, the only place worth your while is the Flower Dome. Rest are all very average and very well marketed. The Flower Dome is where you will spend maximum time as you will go mad clicking pics. The Cloud Forest is useless. I was very keen to see the mist time @ Cloud Forest. Well, its just about ok, nothing great...and now comes the so called famous lighting show in the evening (7.40 pm and 8.40 pm)...it is really mediocre...I read so many reviews on TA about how good it is, but let me tell you it will quite useless and boring...about this place, if you don't believe me, ask the local Singapore people and they will tell you its a farce and overhyped place...also, the 2 domes actually look good from other parts of Singapore like from the Singapore Flyer...So, what does the above mean? Only if you are spending 4 days or more in Singapore, you go for Gardens By The Bay, else you can easily skip it...there are much better things to do in Singapore.How to reach - people who use public transportation, you can reach either through MRT or through bus. Through MRT you have to use Circle Line and reach Bayfront MRT and then walk down almost 400 meters. People who don't like walking too much, I would recommend the bus whereby reach Marina Gardens Drive and get down at the Main Gate of the gardens. It is a much shorter walk trust me.My observations/tips/info -1. The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are super cold (air conditioned). So, while it is silly to carry warm clothes only for these, but wearing something thick is a good idea.2. There is a McDonald's there.3. Charges - you can just go and roam around freely in the gardens, but my view is that since you make an effort to go there all the way, do then spend some money and see the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. The Flower Dome is worth the money.4. I booked online (package of Flower Dome + Cloud Forest) on klook.com and got a good discount. I recommend that.5. For OCBC Skyway you have to pay extra and funnily the ticket plaza for that is separate and not available at the main ticket counters. God only knows who came up with this smart xxx idea.6. I was very keen for OCBC Skyway but when I went underneath it to buy the tickets, I could see how useless it is, so thankfully I didnt go for it and spend extra. (so, on hindsight I thank the smart xxx who kept the ticket booth separate, that way I could see what is the OCBC Skyway and choose not to go for it!7. Mist times in the Cloud Forest are every 2 hours. Well its quite average, but if you have paid, then please experience it as it is the only little bit of wow factor there.8. Even if it rains which it was when we went, you are safe within the complex and within the domes. Only thing you will not be able to do is walk around in the gardens and do OCBC Skyway which anyway is useless9. There are decent amount of restaurants in the complex. Indians please note that this is an Indian restaurant (but we didn't eat there, so don't know how it is, so don't blame us later on)10. It will easily take 2-4 hours there.11. So, best time to reach is at 4 pm. First visit Flower Dome, and then by the time you reach Cloud Forest, you could experience the 6 pm mist time. And post that you have enough time to see other stuff. And at 7.45 you can see the over hyped lighting activity the Supertree Grove area12. Oh yes, I must mention that since we went during chirstmas, they were doing this Christmas Wonderland special activity for which, yes you are right, you have to pay extra. And I cant tell you every dollar used in that was a waste. Some really stupid live carol singing happening which will put you to sleep and then some sidey gaming options and then wait wait the biggest fraud - which is the artificial blizzard...oh my god, it was so useless. People who are not visiting during Christmas can ignore this. But please be wary of any activation they are doing there and asking for more money13. The gift shops are pretty nice but obviously exorbitantly priced (like all other Singapore gift shops @ tourist areas).So, this is a Singapore Tourism gimmick...yes, they have spent tonnes of monies to make it. Respect them for it. And the fact that you can visit it free, I respect the tourism board for that. But, what of your precious time??!!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/04/64/dc/c5/papsm.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r447400004-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,Rob S,Unique and well maintained gardens in the heart of Singapore,30,29-Dec-16,Didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised.

Gardens by the Bay,ruizgen,To visit because it's one of Singapore's main attractions,30,25-Dec-16,"The gardens itself is free but to visit the 2 domes, we need to pay S$22.00 (I booked online through WTS Travel which was cheaper than normal price of S$28.00). As some reviewers had mentioned, the intention to create something unique was achieved, with a wide collection of flowers and trees existing in different parts of the world. But yes the addition of weirdly looking animal statues in parts of the domes plus the tacky looking Christmas tree were disappointments. There's also a lack of good, reasonably priced places to eat in close proximity to the Domes. There was the Satay by the Bay hawker center but it's not considered nearby especially if one would walk under the intense heat of Singapore's sun. I actually expected something better than what I had seen.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/a3/default-avatar-2020-38.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r446524126-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,nikolai69,"EXTREMELY mixed experience - great architecture and horticulture, but horrible entertainment atmosphere",30,24-Dec-16,Went to see this masterpiece of horticulture combined with novel architecture and landscaping. Truely marvelous feat especially the cloud forest dome - giant artificial trees also very interesting. And everywhere beautiful flowers and greenery. BUT and it is a very big BUT - the asmosphere is 100% like an amusement park - piped music in loud speakes in the flower dome? How tacky can you make it. Carved wooden eagles and other animals suddenly protuding from an otherwise impeccably made flowerdisplay or brilliantly sculptured wall of greenery. Again the way this place as suddenly been turned into an entertainment venue is truely tasteless. And to top it off - some of the most horrific CHistmas displays including a cinderrella snow landscape in the middle of of the Baobab and catus displays.Go for the Botanical gardens if you have even an ounce of good taste - otherwise you will be sorely disappointed here.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/00/default-avatar-2020-4.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r446401675-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

I always like the coldness of the two indoor biospheres but think $28 per person and no concession for over 65 's yet a big one if local was toppy for a maximum hours viewingWe were the 1st inside as up early so got around quickly but still there's not a great area to cover and I suppose you can read all the stuff on the countries eco strategies but it was all a bit dry and you come to marvel at the plants after all .So combine it with other stuff or get a deal as part of a package and it would be a good choice,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0d/a0/eb/4a/andydave.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r446199398-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

The place is basically a series of large, very well maintained gardens. Most of the gardens are free, but they aren't really that impressive. The key things to see here:1. Cloud Forest - Air conditioned massive glass house, that contains what is basically a magnificient effort of engineering - an artificial hill with hundreds of plant species distributed across different altitudes. Really made me marvel. It was a lot of fun to walk the high walkways. Best part of the park.2. Flower Dome - Basically a greenhouse filled with thousands of flowers. As someone from India (where flowers are everywhere) it wasn't too impressive.3. Supertree Groves - Solar cell embedded tree-like structures. There is a OCBC skyway (which lets you walk near the top) which was closed due to Christmas celebrations. THIS IS AN UNFAIR RIPOFF.Overall a good place to kill a couple of hours, the $20/28 tickets are quite reasonable to visit the cooled observatories.

Gardens by the Bay,Shilpa_Lakhani,"Just something touristy to check off the list,",30,16-Dec-16,"Well this is a nice, colorful and futuristic park, the highlight being the 18 Supertrees which make you go wow for like 5 minutes and then it's okay. The park takes an average of about 2 hours if you want to see it completely so don't try to do it on the first day you arrive like me as it can be quite draining plus it can get quite hot and humid, making it a tiring experience It's a decent place, honestly nothing great just something touristy to check off the list, I would definitely skip it on my next visit.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0d/e3/64/cf/shilpa-lakhani1.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r444585573-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,Bdcz,Lost ambience,30,15-Dec-16,"On previous visits to the Gardens by the Bay, we found it to be very peaceful, serene and beautiful, especially at night with the musical show on the super-trees. However, they have killed the ambience by putting up some garish ""Christmas"" props. Firstly, there was nothing resembling Christmas - no Santa, no reindeers, no pagent, no stunning Christmas trees, etc. Just large structures with very bright coloured lights that overshadow the giant trees. Then they had the food stalls which was a poor attempt to feature the Xmas markets. To make matters, they charged $6 for entry to the super-trees area which is normally free. Very disappointed that such a beautiful area which could have been magical like the Orchard Road Xmas decorations, was spoilt by cheap and tacky decor.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/6d/default-avatar-2020-19.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r444281570-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

It looked really good and could hear the music playing.Unfortunately you cannot turn up and pay, you need to book on line and print off the tickets, therefore you will need access to a printer.There were a lot of disappoint people being turned away, so not just us who misunderstood.I did try to purchase online, but ended up setting up a Visa Pay account which is similar to PayPal, I thought I was selecting pay by visa. Once you have created an account you can pay and print your tickets.I did mange to create an account, and add a card, but after checkout I kept getting an error, and in the end gave up and decided not to bother.

The only thing i'm looking forward to is the cool air (which the guide claims it's not coming from the aircon but from the plants). After all, this dreaded venue is quite a distance from the MRT station/bus stop. In the midst of this sweltering heat getting in that cool dome is indeed a relief.The plant species are nothing to be excited about, have seen them during my travels, nothing exotic.

Gardens by the Bay,KatrinaC18,Great gardens but the ticketing system is a nightmare.,30,5-Dec-16,"We loved the gardens, it's flora and views over the city. It was wonderful to see great architecture and lots of variety of plants. Almost everything lived up to our expectations and more, apart from some things that I would like to mention. And for those reasons I decided to give it 3 stars:- ticketing system is a nightmare and not very straight forward like in Kew Gardens in London for example. When you come to the main gate, you cannot buy tickets to all attractions there. You have to walk to most places you want to see and queue up all over again. So if you come at the busy time like we did, you will feel like spending time in the queues! Also, even when you think you can buy a ticket to a Skywalk for example, you will later realise at the counter that it's a mandatory to have a ticket to Christmas wonderland and guess what?))) you cannot buy ticket for this attraction at the same counter! It's a very disorganised system. We had to queue up again to get a ticket to Wonderland and then queue up again to get a ticket to Sky walk to then queue up to get to a sky walk! So stupid!- They promise you a free souvenir with tourist pass but guess what?;)) none of the counters we bought a ticket from had it! Why can't they deliver their promises and give you a souvenir at the main gate ticketing place!?- after we paid additional fee to enter Wonderland, we were forced to pay more for attractions inside the fair! I mean common guys! It's unacceptable to treat visitors like that.- Flower dome is nothing special at all and isn't worth the money they ask you to pay for it!My suggestion to administration would be:- Sell tickets to all attractions in all ticketing counters!- Have stored free promised souvenirs at all ticketing counters- Display clearly what's included and not included in a ticket price and what would be additional fees on the territory of attraction- Include flower dome in the same ticket for Cloud forest and don't charge extra for it.- Offer free shuttle to the domes for old people, family with small children, people with disabilities and pregnant women.

It was too hot out to comfortably explore the differently themes gardens and I barely scratched the surface with my morning visit. The OCBC Skyway, which is a short pathway high up between super trees at the Supertrer Grove was also nice. It was a bit cooler and breezier than at ground level and also provided some good vistas surrounding the city.I say the garden is young because the plant growth on the super trees haven't reached the top support of the structures.

Spectacular if you are into that but for me, just a long walk after a hefty meal, so great workout in an climate control dome full of flowers. The tree grove is the tall multi led trees you see in the pictures. It's nice but nothing worth repeating. Over all. If you are In Singapore and have nothing else to do, it could be an option.

They feature tropical flora from different parts of the world, and are interesting enough. The Supertree grove part of the outdoor gardens which has large artificial towers with plants wrapped around is an interesting concept though we thought them to be somewhat pointless. There is a skyway (SGD 8 fee) connecting the supertrees but it was closed when we were there.The highlight was the indoor conservatory Flower Dome, which features trees and flowers from various parts of the world, very nicely organized and very informative, and thankfully very air conditioned. The second conservatory Cloud Forest was a little gimmicky with a recreation of a mountain forest environment complete with faux waterfall. Had great views of the Sands from inside the dome though. The conservatory tickets are SGD 28 for the two domes.The gardens store deserves special mention for some unique (if overpriced souvenirs) including potted plants of different shapes and sizes.Overall, recommended for a one time visit for a tourist, especially if you have an interest in horticulture.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/60/avatar038.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r430337730-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Spend the same amount of time in the Botantical Gardens and you'll immediately see what I mean.The highlights are the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest exhibitions for which there is an entrance fee. The Supertree Grove and skywalk is OK too, best at night when it lights up. If you're there in the evening, hang around for the 7.45pm or 8.45pm music and light show but don't make a special trip or cry if you miss it.All worth doing on your visit to Singapore but not as good as it's cracked up to be - Botanical Gardens is much better.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/df/99/default-avatar-2020-40.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r429193852-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,LA_Bham,Enjoyed the sights,30,15-Sep-16,We visited the place on a weekend in Aug 2016. We enjoyed the sights but they really did not exceed our expectations (maybe we expected too much).The place was teeming with people and it was a nightmare when we tried to go back to our hotel. The queue at the taxi rank was quite long.I recommend to visit the place during weekdays/weeknights.

Gardens by the Bay,AmorSabella,Blooming Place to be for Flower Lovers...,30,14-Sep-16,APlace to visit if you like cool place and Flowers. There are two domes the first one is the flowers experience and the next one is a Mountain Forest Experience. The ticket boith is like 10-15 minutes walk to the 2 Cooled Conservatories. You pay 28SGD per person for the two coservatories and 3SGD each for the Shuttle. I love the Flower conservatory because it showcase flowers that are blooming and great collection as well. The cactus area is also nice. But the second Conservatory was not quite as spectacular as compared to a real mountain. Although I am impressed with the arts place around it. A nice place to visit for nature and flower lovers.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/7c/01/default-avatar-2020-5.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r418283509-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,mpmadz,Okay.. i've seen better. but impressed by the crystals,30,5-Sep-16,"If this is your first flower garden visit, you would be most impressed. First off, I thought the domes were huge that you need to take a buggy to see all. But both domes (cloud forest and flower dome) will take around 30-45 minutes on foot.Both domes are air conditioned, a great relief after walking around Singapore's humid and hot weather. We first visited the cloud forest which has a water falls. They created a walk through on the cloud forest so that you can go up and see the falls from the top. I think whats amazing is that this entire mountain thing including the falls is man made, which was really tricky to the eye at first. From the walk way to the clouds you can have a good view of the super trees. They also created art from branches. Funny as it may seem, I felt a bit mislead by the word ""cloud dome"" because i thought i would be seeing clouds or walking past clouds while going up the mountains.The flower dome was well maintained. They are landscaped as if they are in nature. Most of the flowers were orchids of various colours. I was hoping to see more kinds to be honest. If you are planning to go to the botanical gardens, my suggestion is to get to the domes first before heading to the botanical gardens.I was very impressed by the crystals. All in all was a good experience but i have seen better.Would recommend it to visitors.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0c/d6/1a/8c/external-avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r414784361-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Remember to bring a sweater, as the temperature is quite low inside.I did not get the point of the Cloud Forest, however.

There was a special orchid display; absolutely stunning.Also note the temperature; we thought the dome would be hot and humid but it was a very pleasant temperature and cooler than outside!The Pollen caf is expensive and the service not as good as you normally get in Singapore.Overall good and worth a visit.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/07/94/b3/7e/lancspozzie.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r410793870-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Misscherus,Nothing to shout about.,30,7-Aug-16,"In general, I would say the whole experience of being at the gardens was just average. Paid to go in the flower dome and cloud forest. They are currently having the orchid exhibition at the flower dome. Nice orchids but too limited in quantity in my opinion and it's mostly all concentrated in the middle of the dome on a one way traffic lane. Difficult to take pictures as you will be blocking the traffic flow. Everything has to be done quick. The other side of the flower dome is like a desert with just cactus exhibition. Cloud forest was basically just a mini forest with a giant waterfall at the entrance. There were a few fossils and glaciers monuments to look at the the ground level and also video clips on natural disasters I think. Too many people were packed at the video section so we decided to skip.The positive side to these two domes is that they are both well air-conditioned and it was very nice to be inside. Nice change to the heat and humidity at the free zone outside. And you get to go in and out the domes as many times you want (within the day of ticket purchase). Just need to get a stamp on your wrist.There is a little cafe/restaurant inside the flower dome. Did not get a chance to look at the menu and environment as they were having a private event when we were there.Overall just an average experience. Will go to the flower dome again in the future only if there's a specialty exhibition (I.e. Tulips exhibition or during festive season when the domes are decorated).

The only thing that was really irritating was that we had to wait a long time for the elevator.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r401771017-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Kimberly E,Worth visiting at night!,30,5-Aug-16,"We went there around 6pm and it still broad daylight. The place was full, really crowded and long queues but we waited patiently. The entrance of going up there is around $4 or $10 I think? But yeah, almost waited in line for like 45mins.We went up and I was quite scared because I thought the bridge is just steady but as I walked it was shaking and I realized the grips that were holding the bridge are a metal rope? (idk the term, sorry). Not guaranted for safety lol. I started to sweat a bit because I was nervous, I'm afraid of heights. Although the good thing is that it was not windy so thank goodness but still, I walked a bit slow but I was with my siblings and dad. Good thing, mom didn't bother to go up because we knew she would be scared [lol]. The view was so amazing, took a photo in a seconds then boom, started walking again without staring down. And only 15-mins is allowed to spend after that, you need to go down.After our thrilling moments, we went down now and great timing, the light show started. It was really cool! Btw, every year there's always a new theme so it's not like boring if ever you're going to visit here again or for first timers. :)",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ee/db/default-avatar-2020-10.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r401610454-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,ongrena,Garden festival 2016,30,4-Aug-16,"GBB is a great place to visit but holding the garden festival there was too spread out so did not get an international feel and too hot to stand and admire the gdns. The buggies that we pay for are split into different areas and meant we had to pay again to go elsewhere or as i found, walked all the way back to the entrance as the buggy i paid for did not stop where i eventually ended up after seeing the fanasy gdns. ( thankfully that was in air con so i could spend time admiring the displays.at aged 62 i needed the buggy! ) staff excellent. Had to pay to see flower dome, which i have seen twice anyway and did mot want to go in, in order to see the free gdn exhibits., the pricing on the net was not clear.

Gardens by the Bay,CecilieAR,Best after sunset,30,25-Jul-16,"We went here during daytime to see what this garden was all about. It's really easy to get here by MRT, as the station is right under the garden (Bayfront station).The coolest thing in the carden is definitely the super trees and the area around them. We didn't do the skywalk though, as we thought 8 SGD per person wasn't wort the 50 meters. The Cloud Forest is also nice, but not so special that it deserves to be the number one thing to do in this city. Yes, it is a nice little waterfall and a nice skywalk, but the hole thing is over within 10 minutes tops!The Flower Dome is not so special in my opinion. Much prettier flowers in the botanical gardens!To enter both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest we payed 20 SGD each (adult).NB! When we planned our trip we thught a visit to Gardens by the Bay would take several hours. We did the whole thing within 2 hours. But you can of course spend the wholde day here if you want. There are a few cafes and restaurants at the site, and also chairs and benches.

Gardens by the Bay,tinkywinky933,An eye opener experience,30,24-Jul-16,There are 2 attractions you would have to go if you visit Garden by the Bay. The first one would be the Flower Dome in which you will get to see different exhibits of flowers. So you would need to check on the calendar of events so that you would not miss your favourite exhibits.Another place to go is Cloud Forest. Cloud Forest is a place where you can have the feeling that you are in a mountain. You will get to experience the Tree Top Walk where you would have the feeling that you are 2000m above the sea level.You can visit the Gift Shop after you had finished the above 2 attractions.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/2d/default-avatar-2020-48.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r396171754-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Traveller201406,The night is more worth it.,30,18-Jul-16,"Gardens by the Bay, basically, is a Must-Go for all tourists. This is where you can see a park with different varieties of trees and plants and flowers. In addition, if you are looking for a place (quiet and quiet) to spend the day, Gardens by the Bay will be the right choice. However, 1 formal advice and that will be: go in the night, because there will be a light show and it is beautiful. After which you can drop by MBS to watch another light show. Overall, i must say, the scenic around Gardens by the Bay is way too beautiful at Night for a busy city/country like Singapore. #proudtobeaSingaporean",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/0b/ce/34/f0/traveller201406.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r393746476-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,Tracey C,Nice but nothing special,30,15-Jul-16,"Enjoyed a nice couple of hours here. It was pleasant and most of the gardens are free to walk around. You can pay to visit the Cloud Garden and the Flower Dome. We chose to just do the Cloud Garden. I was a little disappointed with it considering it cost $32 for two. Again it's nice but nothing spectacular, it does give some nice views of Marina Bay Sands Hotel and would probably be much better at night time.

Gardens by the Bay,NickF982,A view from the tree tops,30,15-Jul-16,"We visited Gardens by the Bay on our recent trip to Singapore. We were actually meant to visit back in 2012 but ran out of time, so we were very much looking forward to visiting this time, as it would have had a couple of years to establish itself.From the moment you enter the park, it is just luscious greenery everywhere. I will be honest, I am not really one to admire plants and trees but walking around the gardens, I actually found it quite relaxing.We walked around for a little while and boredom started to slowly creep in, all the ""exciting"" stuff comes with a price. If you wanted to walk on the tree top bridge to look at the fantastic views, this was something you had to pay for. We payed our money and walked along the bridge, yes the views were fantastic, great photo opportunities but you only get 15 minutes to get from one end to the other. This becomes a little hard as there were selfie sticks everywhere and you were constantly waiting for people to finish up. The good thing was, they had a staff member constantly walking up and down making sure people were not just sitting there blocking the bridge up.We didn't visit the conservatories, again added extra. The children's play area looked like a lot of fun, it wasn't fully open as they were doing some maintenance work but what was open, kids were enjoying themselves.It ended up raining quite heavily when we were there, not a lot of places to wait undercover, especially if you in the middle of one of the gardens, you will get drenched.At the end of the day, we have seen it and did enjoy what we saw but if you are going as a family or large group and you want to see everything, be prepared to pay.I doubt that we will visit again anytime in future visits to Singapore.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/be/c8/97/nick-f.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r392688045-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,Jascha K,Good but not great,30,15-Jul-16,"This is a nice place to enjoy a good walk and to relax away from the streets of downtown Singapore. You only have to pay if you want to enter the Cloud Forest (which is really great) and the Flower Dome (which is okay), that's currently 28S$ for both, a bit too expensive in my opinion. The SuperTrees are a lovely sustainable idea, and good for a photo or two. But having in mind that this is supposed to be a botanical garden with flowers from all over the world, I must admit that I have seen gardens that are much more interesting and offer more exotic plants.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e3/6a/default-avatar-2020-47.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r392550706-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Views over the city, Singapore Flyer and Marina Bar Sands hotel through the dome. Photo opportunities but a lot of people and you have to wind in between selfie sticks and people who have no sense of people around them.At the bottom you go through some theatre and information rooms which talk about the impact of Global warming, extinction of animals, caves and an overview of the gardens.Nice but not really spectacular.Didn't visit the flower dome.Due to the torrential rain we could not walk around the gardens as planned.

Gardens by the Bay,927kezz,"Spectacular, Exciting, Beautiful - Needs a cafe/coffee shop at the Ticket Entrance",30,9-May-16,"I had a morning visit to Gardens by the Bay walking from the City. Entering the garden from Marina Boulevard I could see the tantalizing tops of the Super Tree Grove and the glass of the tops of the Conservatories Domes. What a fabulous skyline! Walked along the well laid out paths and gardens to the Super Tree Grove which is in the free section of the garden. Lift up to the Skyway, great photo opportunities looking down into the whole garden.Gardens by the Bay is a technological, architectural and engineering triumph; built on over 100 acres of reclaimed sea which is astonishing. Spectacular, beautiful, amazing, exciting! There are over 100 acres of walk-able gardensThis is a show-piece for Singapore, and it is! However, finding a cafe or coffee shop or small shop selling water and cold drinks within the garden or at the Dome's entrances, nowhere to be seen, maybe I missed it. There were a couple of restaurants under the colonnade opening at lunch time.

Gardens by the Bay,Siriporn671,Interesting place to visit,30,6-May-16,The outside garden is normal. The trees inside the domes are interesting. It contains many huge and interesting trees.

This is first place where I have seen such discrimination of foreigners.2. the crowds of people who are not really interested in the gardens. I had a feeling that their major and only goal to make self-photo everywhere.

A pleasant enough 90 minutes, but the whole glass bubble was air conditioned within an inch of its life which we felt was entirely unnecessary either for the plants or the visitors. The ""cloud forest"" dome has the highlight with a more sensible humid warm climate control with impressive towering vertical plant displays and fake waterfalls. The second highlight was the window cleaners abseiling down the outside of the dome.So called ""super trees"" look good illuminated at night from atop the Marina Bay Sands building, but up close by day look tacky and could have been transplanted from. a North London adventure playground. The aerial walkway between the SuperTrees was OK, but eminently missable. Signage around the attraction is very poor and the map provided does not fully represent the layout.The onsite Pollen Restaurant we found unnecessarily pretentious as a lunch stop. We were not allowed to place our daypacks on the floor, each had to have its own special ""handbag stool"" to sit on. Whatever!

For example when I was buying the tickets for the indoor domes, this staff that served me was just talking to his friend beside on what to eat for dinner. Most of the staffs there kept using their phones as well when they are supposed attend to customers. The food there are just so so, it will be better to go to other hawkers or restaurant to eat.

Gardens by the Bay,Felix F,"""Disney's Botanical Gardens"" ;)",30,22-Feb-16,"No question - these glass domes and their surroundings are spectacular, and many people will be fascinated by them.However, to me it seems absurd to erect massive, air-conditioned domes, cool the air inside to 15 degrees and fill it with plants from everywhere else in the world and an ""indoor waterfall"". Especially in a city like Singapore, that has beautiful parks and arguably one of the most beautiful botanical gardens in the world with free entrance.Apart from this, the indoor waterfall area (cloud forest) looks like a multi-storey car park from the inside, which is already covered with algae and mould and is in need of renovation. Also, tickets are quite pricey (approx 25 SGD) and the attraction is not that large. When we were there, the treewalk was closed for maintenance.Nonetheless, if you are sensitive to the hot and humid climate in Singapore or have a particular interest in giant glass structures, this is a good place to see plants.

Gardens by the Bay,dandydavid,A nice place to walk amongst nature,30,10-Feb-16,"Have entered this attraction through the MRT station you go up in a lift to walk through the prestigious Marina Bay hotel with what looks like a boat stuck on its three pillars, there again it look like a desert island( or perhaps the designers could not decide what theme they were aiming for) We went on Chinese New Year's Day and to say it was crowded would be an understatement. The review will have to reflect that. I headlined that this was a nice walk and it was in order to keep away from the crowds that were queuing to enter the glasshouse attractions and the skywalks. I am sure that on a quieter day we would have enjoyed it more and be able to see the attractions that were queued out.

But since the ticket for it was cheap I guess it was that much of a rip off.We also went to the two glass domes and I must say the cloud forest was quite interesting. The entrance was quite satisfying with the waterfall and the atmosphere throughout was quite pleasing. However, the flower gardens dome was quite boring in my opinion as there was not much to do apart from look at flowers.I guess this place is worth a visit and maybe it was just not to my taste.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r346088943-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,ColbethFamily,The domes are aren't well lit after dark,30,25-Jan-16,"With great expectations, my family and I (husband and self, 2 teenage children, 2 elderly parents in their 80's) took taxis to the Gardens. We'd have taken the MRT, but the walk from the MRT exit looked to be quite long - too long for my elderly parents. Good taxi drop off point.Hotel staff had suggested we go towards the end of the day, to see the tall towers lit up, which we did. We arrived at about 5pm. Domes are magnificent (S$28pp entry for both domes). For diversity of flora, and as an educational source, absolutely excellent - plants from all over the world. What we weren't told, however, is that although the domes are open after dark, there is very little lighting provided, so we were walking around in almost darkness by the time we reached the cloud dome. There were some spotlights on some plants/displays, but I needed to use the flashlight app on my iphone to actually see the plants and flowers up close. That was disappointing.The lit up towers at night were beautiful.Best tips: see inside the domes before darkness falls. Have a coffee and wait for the towers to be lit up after dark. Also, we weren't told until we were leaving that there were wheelchairs available (for rent??) for my elderly parents - they were very tired after all the walking - check at the information counter.Worth a visit if you are botanically-inclined.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/df/2b/default-avatar-2020-39.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r342523120-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

I saw another token booth but it was closed.shouldnt they open more booths to serve the mad crowd?Basically it was so crowded that we couldn't enjoy the games nor the beautiful lights there as people were constantly pushing around the move.Gardens by the bay staff should have had some crowd control, not let so many people into the park.Firstly, it was hard to even walk there.Secondly, you can't even stop to enjoy the scenery.First and last time going to such outdoor events at Gardens by the bay.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e4/a9/default-avatar-2020-50.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r339772225-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Ticket line was 30 minutes. We went to cloud forest and then flower dome. Honestly, it wasn't so much the crowds that were a problem but the total lack of any crowd control. For example, for cloud forest you can go up to 7th floor but they stopped elevator operations for floors 1-6 and so I had to take the stroller down the escalator for each floor. There was no staff overseeing the crowds except at the entrance.We ate at satay by bay and it was not impressive.

Long queues for everything including lifts to get from one level to another. And the worse part? The toilets. For a park of this size, I cannot fathom how the park planners decided to only have on central toilet, and worse of all, only 2 -3 cubicles to handle crowds of thousands.We wanted to get a ticket onto the SkyWalk to avoid the crowd, but even that was sold out.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f1/42/default-avatar-2020-20.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r334965892-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Lizayam,A Work of Art,30,13-Dec-15,"Strolling around the Shoppes @ the Marina Bay Sands gives you an access through a walkway to the Gardens by the Bay. A garden with a diverse range of plant life through themed gardens. A word of advice : Your legs should hold up long distances of walking and standing.One of its key attractions is the Supertrees. If you go up the 22 meter OCBC Skyway, you'll have a bird's eye view or a vertical plant display of these trees. There's a light and sound show where the trees come to life 2x nightly around 7:45 and 8:45pm. There were kiosks and food stalls but the lines are long before you can buy food. It was quite tiring and there were plenty of people. And the light show wasn't that spectacular. It should have been more colorful and brighter. But for a first timer like us (with my 2 daughters), it was quite an experience. Something unique. I would still recommend that people visit this attraction.Next is the Flower Dome where you'll see different types of trees, floral displays and Christmas decors of all kinds which created a festive mood throughout the place.Last stop was Cloud Forest which showed a 35 meter man-made mountain and waterfalls. It was so cold inside with splashes of water going down the walkways. Didn't stay here for long as we were already tired going through the attractions for almost 4hours.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/95/1f/37/lizayam.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r332434408-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,pragasam,Misinformation & Poor Night-time Signage,30,30-Nov-15,"On Thursday 5th November 2015, having decided to visit Gardens by the Bay in the cool of the evening, my wife and I ventured there in a taxi from our hotel. We arrived at about 7:00 p.m. and went to seek advice and directions as this was our first visit. The guy at the Information Desk seemed somewhat disinterested and unenthusiastic. In a perfunctory manner, he unfolded a map and circled the area where the Super Trees Grove was located and told us that the shows would be at 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. We enquired about the possibility of us visiting either the Flower Dome or the Cloud Forest Dome, but he discouraged us by saying that it would be too dark to see anything in the Domes and that we would require a minimum of one and a half hours to view each dome, and that it was best to view these during daylight hours. We were somewhat taken aback by his comments since the Gardens Website indicated that the closing time for the Domes was 9:00 p.m. and tickets should be purchased before 8:00 p.m., the last admission being 8:30 p.m. We expected the Domes to be floodlight at night.With the scant information and directions given, we attempted to find our way to the Grove to catch the light and music show. After groping about unsuccessfully, we followed a group of people who seemed to be headed to the Grove. We got into a lift that led to the level where the Gardens were located. Using the lit-up trees as a guide, my wife and I navigated our way to the Grove which seemed to be filling up rapidly with tourists and locals ' understandable since admission was free. Seating was rather limited and, after standing for awhile, we just sat where we could on the warm brickwork and waited about 25 minutes before the Garden Rhapsody light and music show began.The medley of music from the classics and film scores was good, and the synchronisation of the lights on the Super Trees was cleverly done. The show, which was colourful and dazzling, lasted a mere ten minutes or so. Given the hassle to get here and the time spent hanging around waiting for the show to start, we felt the short duration of the show a bit of a let-down. However, we were glad to have 'been there and done that' and to have seen what the hype was all about.When the show ended, the crowd dispersed en masse in all directions. We scouted around the Grove a bit looking for the exit that would take us to the MRT station. We followed some locals along a path that wend its way to the lift and got stuck in the queue for several minutes. There was just the solitary lift catering for a limited number of people at a time. There were no clear signs or indications of alternative ways to exit the Gardens. We eventually managed to squeeze ourselves into the lift. When we emerged at the level above, we looked around for signposts to the MRT station but, unless one had owl's eyes, these were not apparent in the dark. The signage was not lit - perhaps all the power was diverted to lighting up the Super Trees. By and by, after wandering around awhile, another tourist pointed the way to us. It turned out to be a walk along a dimly lit path which eventually took us to the MRT station.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/ae/9b/c2/pragasam.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r329846353-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,skymist,"If you like Universal Studios, Marina Bay Sands, the 'Shoppes' and the Singapore Eye, you will probably like this too",30,27-Nov-15,"I am probably not the best person to recommend something this contrived. The concept claims to be ecologically sound and committed to raising awareness of climate change, but it seems to be a very elaborate and expensive way of doing it. A previous reviewer has described it as 'Disneyland for Plants', and that pretty well sums it up for me too.Thinking that I had been too harsh when I visited the project first time around in 2012, I went again this month and paid to go inside both domes. Sadly I saw little three years on to change my view.The lifts, suspended walkways and largest man made indoor waterfall are arguably great feats, as is the technology behind the artificial climates, [and the Christmas decorations are all very jolly], but a testament to Nature it is not.In my eyes it is not even close to the beauty and richness of the traditional Botanic Gardens.

It was clean and nicely organized, however I did think it was a bit overrated. It wasn't something that I would go out of my way to do. I honestly was more impressed with the botanical gardens. But even so they do have a nice light show every night. I also enjoyed how they talked about the impacts of climate change in the cloud dome. I thought that was the best part! Otherwise it was just average nothing too special. I did go just as the sun was about to set. The place did not have lots of lighting so I recommend going a bit earlier. But do stick around for the light show. But if you're in a time crunch go to the botanical garden and skip the hefty entrance fee (28$).",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0b/33/b7/fb/joselyn-g.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r320726696-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

This review covers the main gardens.Firstly, the signage is woeful and it took us ages to find the path connecting the ten or so feature gardens. From the ticketing area beside the two domes, all signs point to the domes or exits or eateries...pretty much signs to places where you will spend money. We eventually worked out that we needed to go up some concrete steps next to a gift shop and information point in order to get to the gardens. They were good, quiet and and relaxing, partly because there were very few people there no doubt because of the difficulty of finding them.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/e3/default-avatar-2020-59.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r320418519-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

You take a lift up giving you a good view of the gardens and the surrounding vacinity; if weather permits. Avoid Sept and October as the smoke haze from neighbouring countries blurs out everything.Entry is about SGD 5.00 More economical if you were to buy tickets for all 3 attractions. A walk around the open areas alone is worth the visit. The open areas are free of charge.

There are Towers in the middle of the garden which you can climb to see a panoramic view of the city. This does have a fee - the fee is modest but then again so is the path. The path is extremely short and only takes about 5-10 minutes to cross as it only connects between two towers, even though there are about 10 towers in the park.

However it's chaotic arrangement without due consideration of the plant classification is very disappointing. The concept of bringing into one roof is there but we think it's more of the aesthetic sense the flower garden was made of. They haven't achieved and maximised the potential of each plant needs as to eg., full or partial sun requirement. Although the environment in the house is controlled there's a lot that needs to be done which could maximised the plants growing conditions. For example, in the cactus section we noted a few turning into yellowish - this should be thrown to the skip. The trees next to the cacti section do not look happy - could be dehydrated.

Gardens by the Bay,Bluesphynx,Expensive and artificial,30,22-Jul-15,"In spite of all the hype, I would only visit once unless I'm bringing out-of-town visitors around Singapore. I can't imagine Singaporeans going repeatedly to the Gardens. First of all, the entrance fee is heavy, especially for foreigners. Next, there is little of the naturalness found in the Botanic Gardens, every bush and shrub is cultivated and not allowed to proliferate naturally, and it looks it. The Cloud forest with the cascading waterfalls and mist is indeed a novelty but it isn't very safe for the elderly or wheelchair-bound. The floorboards are perpetually wet from the spray and you have to keep going up and round to quite great heights, all very picturesque but you wouldn't want to do it more than once.Then, the plants cultivated in the various enclosures (and you must pay again for some) can be seen in their native lands - Australia, Japan or Europe in greater glory and variety.Lastly, reasonably-priced food is difficult to find. 'L'indochine' with its fine views is best visited at night, the lunch we had was expensive and did not even taste fresh while 'Pollen' for some inexplicable reason was closed while the local food were more expensive versions of those found elsewhere in Singapore.At night though, it's beautifully lit up, but then you can get a stunning view as you ride in the bus over Benjamin Sheares Bridge.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r291353876-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

It was definitely aimed at the kids whith all the lights blinking to the beat of the entire catalogue of the Disney movie soundtrack collection. Still impressive to adults none the less. Well worth a visit.What i found most interesting is that the super trees are not just these colossal structures that look good, they actually have a purpose, one is a restaurant, some are chimneys, others are exhausts and each and every single one of them is a solar power conductor. Pretty cool!Also, if you do pay to go up on the sky walk where you can walk amongst thse big pretty structures, you can get some great shots of the city, the Marina Bay Sands and the High Flyer.Of all the things to do in Singapore this is definitely more on the touristy side but still worth the trip.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/09/28/10/alisha-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r279463977-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

But local residents get a choice of visiting one conservatory (SGD12) or two (SGD20); senior locals get to pay SGD 8 and 15 respectively. Locals may welcome this differentiation but tourists may find them being discriminated against.I saw near the entrance a photo with lotus flowers. When I asked for information at the Visitors Information, I was given wrong information because their direction would make me retrace my steps and I did not see any lotus ponds on the way to the Visitors Information Centre.

Gardens by the Bay,yonic81,A not bad Man-made nature,30,20-May-15,"The month visited is Tulipmania theme - also fairy tales theme. I saw a lot of different breeds of tulips and I got to know that you can easily see tulips in all seasons. Very colorful bouquet, carving on trunks, varieties of flowers and plants, cactuses, air plants and so on.I personally feel the low budget fairy tales decoration is quite pathetic. The little red hood is so scary standing at the corner and not seeing her face. Rapunzel not facing us at her tower with her long hair falling down, it's another scary princess. One more princess cover up with a masque, tall, I couldn't tell who is she from the head to toe. No mood for me to take photos for memories. Haha gosh!

So, we toured Marina Bay Sands Hotel and waited for dusk.Around 6 pm, we walked over and purchased the tickets; where 'Tulipmania' is on right through May. A lot of tulips were flown in from Holland for display. I was expecting vibrant colourful of tulips on display. A disappointment. The lights were dim, and only certain corners have bright lights shining down. There were figurines and building structures to give the somewhat boring display a lift. Within half an hour, we were out.At the purchasing booth, luckily we were informed about the daily evening 'Light Rhapsody' shows at the Supertree Grove at 7.45pm and 8.45pm apart. We rushed over and reached just in time for the free show to start. I watched the lights laying on my back, following the music. It's something, but it could be better. Fortunately, no rain.

We did get permission and again joined the queue.Unbelievably he refused to believe us ! and phoned himself to check - effectively calling us a liar.It was very embarrassing, and when we tried to complain we were just given 'shrugs.'I've noticed Singapore seems to have a policy of making young college graduates Managers- maybe because of their language skills. They are not generally equipped to deal with customer service. This is a truly beautiful addition to Singapore's tourism, but my treatment there reduced me to tears twice, it was so disappointing.

Gardens by the Bay,travelling_L0uL0u,'Tulipmania' not mania or tulip. Cloud forest awesome,30,25-Mar-15,So we spent the day wandering around the gardens and went into both conservatories. As a tourist to Singapore you have to purchase a ticket that covers you for both conservatories. If you have flown with Singapore airlines you can show them your boarding card for 10% off. There is also a charge for the walkway between the supertrees but the rest of the gardens are free. Recommend wearing comfortable footwear. It was very interesting to learn about the purpose of the supertrees - they are not just for show but I won't spoil it for you.The new Tulipmania was a big let down. There were actually not that many tulips and it was interwoven with fairy tales which made it seem very tacky and over the top. The rest of the gardens get a five from me though.There is plenty of information signs on the various aspects of the gardens and the features in them. Close to the bayfront MRT and Marina Bay Sands for some food or a cool off. Satay by the Bay is an eating area and I highly recommend the Turkish stand. The food was incredible especially the Pide.Overall worth a vist. You can spend as much or as little time here as you want. Would recommend the conservatories but do not miss the cloud forest!

Gardens by the Bay,Priyanka M,Wanted to see the Garden which is one of it's kind,30,10-Dec-14,"Hey, i don't have point to point review this time but still have shared my experience. .. may be it helps you to decide if you wanna go or not. .good luck-----My mother and niece visited me earlier this summer and we all went for the first time to Garden by the bay.I'm Singapore PR so the ticket charges are different then that of a tourist's hence please present your ID to them for certifications.I took a wheelchair (no additional cost) for my mom which was really convenient for her. I strongly recommend others to get wheelchair too if they have elderly people as there is a huge area to cover.The flowers, cactus etc (definitely enormous variety) but as I'm not so much of a fan so got bored after a little while. Imean how many flowers can you really see:)Still, it's done really nicely and looks beautiful, so i say you should pay a visit atleast once.Later the waterfall vertical garden, excellent, is not for those who are afraid of heights (like my niece).It was fun but to me the whole thing took twice the time it should have taken.I had a baby stroller and my mom's wheelchair but the elevator that i could find could only adjust 1 thing at a time (too small) so i had to go back and forth.Lastly, we could only view the domes as there was thunder and the skyway is closed during rain/expecting rain....Hence all together my experience was a 5 on 10.Hope there was something resourceful for you.

But seriously, it was a little lame. I know I came to see plants, but I really was expecting more. U might as well walk into anyone's huge garden and you would probably see the same things, minus the air conditioning. The cloud dome was worse, it was nice at first, with the waterfall and everything, then u need to climb all these stairs and take all these escalators to these different exhibits showing uninteresting and dull showcases of the usual environment stuff, which didn't intrigue me at all, no matter how much I tried. It was like some sort of overpriced school excursion that is just as boring as the last one you had.

Gardens by the Bay,PVBGirl,I'm Not Sure What The Point Is,30,13-Oct-14,But - if you're in Singapore for the first and probably only time in your life - like we were - you probably have to see it.I'm a big garden/flower fan. Have been to many great gardens and flower shows - like the Chelsea Flower Show in London and Butchart Gardens in Victoria (a place a Canadian poster here alluded to) - all over the world.This isn't one of those places. I suspect the light shows at night are better than the gardens/domes (which are far from cheap - especially compared to the bargain of the Botanic Gardens/Orchid Garden).In any event - we walked here from the Marina Bay Sands. It's a very easy 10 minute walk.If anyone from this attraction reads these reviews - I have one recommendation. The domes seemed to have some interesting films/presentations. We would have loved to sit down for a while and watch them. But seating was *extremely* limited (especially considering how many people visit this place) - and it was difficult/impossible to see the presentations if one didn't have a seat. Needless to say - no seats were available when we were passing through. If the goal is to push as many people through as possible - you're doing a great job. If the goal is for people to have a good/informative time - you can do better.

Subsequently it became just average as I have already witnessed it several times as I am a native of Singapore. But I would encourage visitors to Singapore to come and enjoy the spectacular sound and light show. It maybe for just 15 minutes but it is a worthwhile experience.

Even in a rain Forrest there can be too much water.In the flower dome, displays were a little mixed as the countries had different plants form other countries in them. The gardens in the park were not really as good as some of the beautiful gardens around the city. I think that is due to plant selection.

Gardens by the Bay,SushiTravelDiaries,Lovely gardens but probably only need to go once,30,29-Aug-14,"It was a nice visit to the Gardens by the Bay although not spectacular. I was looking forward to seeing the largest man-made waterfall and this was in the Cloud Forest where you see this the moment you enter the dome. I took the MRT there getting off at Marina Bay station and walking to the newly constructed Bayfront station (under covered) which is actually on the yellow circle line. You have to purchase a ticket for this for foreigners which is SGD$10 for one dome or SGD$28 for both domes (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) and there was a queue which lasted about 15 minutes when I arrived around 4pm on a Saturday. The Cloud Forest was quite worthwhile, simulating a cloud rainforest where you need to take a lift all the way to the top and gradually make your way down the levels. Getting into the lift was a bit chaotic and you had to push your way through to the next available lift. But coming down the winding walkway was lovely. The Flower Dome was a bit of a let down but others may enjoy the vast area inside with plants from different continents. While I was there in August 2014 there was an orchid exhibit inside which you had to queue up to see! The highlight was Symphony by the Gardens which started promptly at 7:45pm and 8:45pm and lasts 15 minutes each time. This is at the Supertrees Grove and the trees light up in different colours in sync with the music. I was lucky enough to be on the archway at the top during the symphony (also need to remember to buy the ticket first SGD$5 before queueing up). Overall it was a lovely visit and you could spend the day there visiting all the other gardens outside, and try to be there when it's dark so you can see the trees light up in different colours. There is also a hawker centre Satay by the Bay although the food there is mediocre.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/d7/a7/8c/chan-sys.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r225270206-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,traveljet,Important to go at the right time,30,22-Aug-14,"It was our first visit to the Gardens by the bay and having experienced the Supertree Grove lightup, the Flower dome and Cloudforest, these are my personal views and tips:SUPERTREE GROVE:This was the highlight of our trip. Please dont miss this as the Supertrees are unique when its lighted up. Its so good to see our little red dot come up with something like this.To fully enjoy the Supertree Grove experience, I highly recommend arriving around late evening eg 7:20pm BEFORE the sky goes dark. Its beautiful when you can still see the evening sky as the lights around the marina area start to come on. The Supertrees also have a faint glow to them at this time. Try to sit in the middle of the grove, facing the Singapore Flyer with Marina Sands on your left.The light & music ""show"" comes on at 7:45pm and 8:45pm, when it is already pitch dark. The light up of the trees is really beautiful. Frankly I would have preferred the trees to be lighted with nice music throughout the night so visitors can enjoy the ambience any time of the night. It's a waste making visitors wait for 7:45pm or 8:45pm for a ""show"" that wasnt particularly spectacular and have the Supertrees in the dark in between the shows. That's why I recommend coming at 7:20pm to see the skyline that's still visible and see how the scene changes whilst waiting for the show at 7:45pm. The Supertrees are fully lighted only during the show itself which is a real pity.The heavy rain in the early afternoon really cooled the place down. I cant imagine sitting in the grove in the heat and humidity in the afternoon. So if you really want to have a more fruitful visit, do it in the evening. Even if you dont pay to enter the 2 Dome Conservatories, this experience at the Supertree Grove itself is worth a visit provided you come at the right time.FLOWER DOMEAlthough I think they did a good job of doing up this dome, we didnt really enjoy it. Simply because we prefer the natural surroundings of a real garden or park where one gets to enjoy the open spaces and sounds of nature. We were in the dome around 4pm when it was fairly crowded with many visitors and school kids. Hence, the human noise and lack of space kept us from truly enjoying the displays in a more serene setting. We didnt have the mood to read the information displayed for each plant and simply walked along as we glanced at the plants.If you are hoping to stroll through the dome and expect a true flower garden or park experience, you may be disappointed. Perhaps the experience may be different in the early morning when its hopefully quieter.CLOUDFORESTWe preferred this to the Flower Dome as it was rather unique and more pleasant. The towering plants and waterfall gave it a more natural setting and the place didnt feel like it was just a giant exhibit.From the entrance, walk in and take in the sight of the lovely waterfall. Then walk further down and take the lift to the 6th floor. Follow the directions and start from the top down.If you only have time for only one dome, I would personally choose this one instead of the Flower Dome.DINING:We had a nice quiet dinner at the Majestic restaurant (chinese cuisine) which is located at the bottom of the Flower Dome building. Though some may find it a little pricey, the simple beef horfun we had was tasty and well prepared. The generous beef slices were tender and the thick kway teow nicely done with some bean sprouts. The portion is enough for two persons ($24) if you are not famished.We included the water spinach (kangkong) with thinly sliced cuttlefish and sambal ($20). This was also very tasty (we requested no MSG and less oil for the dishes) although you will have to ask for more sambal if you want it spicier.The dessert of Chilled green tea jelly with aloe vera, lime was extremely refreshing and delicate in taste. Very good. Tea and peanuts are charged separately. If you order plain water, its $1 for a bottle. It wasnt a cheap dinner as the cost came to $76.50! but we thoroughly enjoyed the meal because it was quiet (6pm on a Thursday) and the food was very well prepared. Nothing irks us more than having to pay a high price for a lousy meal so thankfully, the restaurant didnt disappoint.The menu is on the website under the Dining section.OTHER PARTS OF THE GARDENWe didnt have time to really walk the other parts of the outer gardens and frankly, we just cant do it in the hot afternoon sun and humidity. That's why we chose the 2 aircon domes and Supertrees in the late evening.So to wrap it up, my personal advice if if you are short on time, just visit the Supertrees Grove around 7.20pm, sit and have a drink till 7:45pm when the lights and music comes on.If you have an hour to spare before that, then visit the Cloudforest. It takes about 15mins leisurely stroll from the Cloudforest to the Supertree grove.Its nearer to walk to the Domes using the Dragonfly bridge if you are coming from Bayfront or Marina - check for directions on the gardens by the bay website map.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/04/06/78/ef/traveljet.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r223533528-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

I once visited the Singapore Botanical Garden and very happy to see the orchid gardennya. Because the area is not too large I did not really expect Gardens by the Bay will exceed the Botanical Garden. But what I saw was disappointing in my opinion.I did not enjoy the outdoor gardens, cause I could not bear the heat, though I came at 3 pm. Although the car shuttle is available, but because the service is only available until 5 pm, hence I had to abort the desire to walk around the gardens.The indoor meanwhile, for the cloud rain forest a bit odd. I think the Gardens would like to show the plant as natural as possible, so it planted randomly. For me, it can not be enjoyed.By the time I came in August 1, 2014, in Flower Dome there was a Persian Garden show. I remember in Keukenhoff I can see a lot of wonderful and colorful flowers. But because the area of Gardens by the Bay is very limited, it can only exhibited few kind of flowers, limited in number. In the Californian Garden, for example, only one citrus tree planted, roses are also only a few.Really disappointing considering SGD 28, it's not cheap I think.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/5d/default-avatar-2020-32.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r221906506-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,the_alphington_flash,Small delight behind the hustle,30,2-Aug-14,"Singapore is endowed with some wonderful gardens, some better known than others. The Botanic Gardens, Hort Park, Chinese Gardens and making the biggest and boldest statement Gardens By the Bay.We chose not to visit the Durian shaped halls of botanical wonder but instead contented ourselves with a ramble through this carefully stage-managed area. One cant be awed by the massive supertrees thrusting their way skywards as these are surely the drawcards of the area.The signage is either ill prepared or premature but there were spots we looked for based on the information on our map that we were unable to located. Each often indigenous gardens is of interest and the discovery walk will become a great place to discuss plant life.At the moment it feels that the dream is greater than the reality but I am sure this will grow and change as every good garden should.

Gardens by the Bay,Mark N,Amazing then dissapointing,30,1-Aug-14,"Well at first sight the whole place is fantastic. The trees are a brilliant idea and the 5 SGD to walk the walkway was worth it.However, the greenhouses are 12 for locals and 28 for foreigners, which is disgraceful. The argument that locals pay for the garden in taxes is pathetic as my taxes pay for attractions in Australia that tourists don't pay extra for.

Gardens by the Bay,TravellerAS80,Good but not essential,30,20-Jul-14,"These gardens are impressively manicured, in a very Singapore way. They're easy to get to from the MRT, too.The open, free gardens themselves and pretty and well laid out, although not terribly mind blowing. To get into the two conservatory domes, foreigners must pay $28, which, if you've been to a few conservatories across the globe, seems like an awfully high price, all things considered. Yes, the domes are pretty, although the Flower Dome was nothing special. The Cloud Dome was impressive, however, with its massive, man-made waterfall and elevated walkway. The climate change message in the multimedia display was also worthwhile.The OCBC skyway across the Supertree Grove was an extra $5, across the other side of the park. While the Supertree Grove is stunning to look at, I think it would be worth visiting at night rather than day, as once you've been in the Cloud dome, the elevated walkway here doesn't feel too much different.If I had my time again? I'd wander around the park and do the OCBC skyway, giving the domes a miss.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/09/50/22/15/missas80.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r216230124-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,badidi,Only buy tickets if you're really into plants.,30,3-Jul-14,"After several visits to Singapore, I finally visited Gardens by the Bay just because I ran out of new places to visit and I've been intrigued by the impressive structures of the Gardens whenever I pass nearby. I got there by passing through a bridge from Marina Bay Sands. I didn't have any idea how to go around the place so I purchased a ticket online for the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Both attractions can be reached by walking through a big garden. I would say that both attractions are not that spectacular. I was expecting to see a lot of colors at the Flower Dome but the plants were mostly green. There was just a small part at the lower level with beautiful flowers. The Cloud Forest, on the other hand, had a high waterfall with interesting plants surrounding it as its main attraction. In fairness, it was amazing to see how plants that we rarely see can thrive in a manmade environment. I was amazed, yes, but since I'm not really into plants, I got bored just like at the Flower Dome so I just walked through fast and headed for the Super Trees. As expected, It was an amazing sight! The time I got there was perfect since it was sunset. The Super Trees started lighting up and we got to watch the Light and Sound show. Generally, the Gardens was an ""okay"" experience for me but if you're not really into plants, I would suggest to just visit the Super Trees and the surrounding gardens.

Gardens by the Bay,vanillafreak13,They keep it interesting enough,30,14-Jun-14,"The garden itself is free to public access. It's only when going in to the domes that you need to purchase tickets. For people who are live being surrounded by nature, they would consider it not worth the money and might even feel a tinge of pity for a country that would try to keep nature in such an enclosed structure. But I find this attraction quite proactive in the movement to conserve nature in a modernized approach. The domes are meant to be self-sustaining. Also, they periodically change the theme inside the Flower Dome, which keeps it interesting. I recommend it not only as a an attraction for conserving nature, but also for the wonderful and iconic design of the buildings that serve as conservatories.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/7a/a0/32/vanillafreak13.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r210254120-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

We went to find the ticket counter to buy a ticket to go up to the sky walk only to be told that it is only open until 8.30 with ticket sales closing at 8pm. The lights show in the 'trees' again was a disappointment - they look fantastic from a distance at night, but the 'light show' was a bunch of lights correographed to music.....not really worth it - glad we didn;t have to pay for that part.

Gardens by the Bay,RSTT,Only for Plant Lovers,30,28-May-14,"Disclaimer: this is the view of a local who lives in Singapore! Tourists may view the place in differently.The good:- The Gardens is beautiful, no doubt about it. Plant and flower lovers will enjoy this place. The Gardens' online brochure practically says it all about what you can find here.- There are some nice, quiet spots where you can have a picnic or packed breakfast/lunch/dinner while enjoying views of Marina Bay or the city skyline (depending on which spot you go to), even during lunchtime where surprisingly the temperatures are quite bearable if you find the right, shaded spot. Early mornings and evenings are better, of course, to avoid the hot weather.- The children's areas (both wet and dry) are very enjoyable for children. They can be entertained for easily two hours or so.- Very nice place for exercise ' lots of fresh air for yoga or tai chi, and lots of space and views for jogging.The not-so-good:- Food ' very expensive. The most 'worth it' for the price is the fast food. That should tell you something. Either BYO or leave the place and go eat somewhere else.- The domes ' very expensive and only for plant lovers. Even with the discount for citizens, I still felt that it was just a big air-conditioned room with plants, and the 'big' isn't even really that 'big' ' I could walk around in less than five minutes. BUT, I must admit I'm not a plant lover. Just like a book browser is in and out of a book shop in a few minutes while a book lover is stuck inside for hours, those who are not really into plants will not find the domes worth the price.Distance ' the Gardens is just too out of the way. There's an MRT that goes there, but for those living outside the city area or away from the Circle Line, it's just too much trouble to go all the way there for' what? The food is nothing special and is hyper expensive. Parks are everywhere in Singapore. Ditto for children's play areas. So, unless you're a plant lover, there's no incentive to spend so much time just to travel there. It's a 'go there once and there's no other reason to go there again' thing.Which also makes me wonder why we spent so much money to build that place.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-a/02/da/82/c8/rstt.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r207419080-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,ashi3d,"Cooled garden facilities, beautiful night scenery of gigantic trees",30,11-May-14,"Going there we took the boat tour from Liang Court until the Marina Barrage area and walked until reaching the main Domes: Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Entrance to the domes will cost you SGD28 (price for tourists/foreigners, which is inclusive for entering both domes).The Flower Dome is a huge garden area, but the landscaping is just average for me. That is, compared to the picturesque gardens of Japan that I have visited. Although you can really enjoy a comfortable leisure walk inside since it is an enclosed cooled facility. The 'tulip mania' which I originally went there for was disappointing, because there were not much tulips to see (if you've also been to a field of tulips before, you'll know what I mean).What I appreciated more was the Cloud Forest as it would immediately surprise you with a man-made falls at the main entrance. There is an elevator facility to take you all the way up the dome and have a closer look at the falls and view of the area from above.From the Cloud Forest, we explored the open garden (no more entrance fees) heading to the Meadow to see the white sculpture of the floating infant. Then we walked back and waited for the sunset until the trees of the Supertree Groves were lit and enjoyed the beautiful view. From there, we headed to the dragon fly bridge to reach the Marina Bay Sands in time for the free Light and Water Show (8PM).In hindsight, I would not have paid for the Flower Dome/Cloud Forest, but hey, if you don't mind paying SGD28 for a cool and leisure garden walk, then go ahead. But, it's also fine to just explore the open garden area, and enjoy the night scenery with spectacular lighting.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/05/65/a6/bd/ashi3d.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r205043949-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Markus1995,Gardens Have Growth Potential,30,23-Apr-14,"For anyone with even a remote interest in plants and gardening, the Gardens by the Bay offer a brilliant concept that has yet to reach its potential. On the day prior to our visit to the Gardens by the Bay, we had visited the Singapore Botanical Gardens, a more established and, frankly, a more elegant offering in terms of presenting plants in their natural habitat. The Gardens by the Bay are almost like an amusement park, with various little areas of interest (e.g. Chinese garden, Indian garden, Colonial garden, etc.). The openly artificial nature of the exhibits in contrast to the Botanic Gardens (which are surely artificial but in a more subtle way). Perhaps the lesson learned here is to visit the Gardens by the Bay first, but if I were to visit only one (for the first time), I would visit the Botanic Gardens instead. On future visits, though, the Gardens by the Bay have potential (for expansion, new exhibits), particularly considering that we did not visit either of the domes.We skipped the two dome exhibits, which I am going to assume are cornerstones of the Gardens. Partly we may have been a little oversaturated by the previous day's Botanic Garden visit; partly the entry fee for the domes was somewhat expensive.As a tourist attraction, the Gardens offer something for everyone (of all ages - probably more family friendly than the Botanic Gardens). The park is well equipped with restrooms, dining options, shuttle transportation (to just outside the Marina Bay Sands), gift shop, and friendly staff.Despite my average rating, on my next visit to Singapore, I would do more upfront research on the domes to see if they are worthwhile and to see what new exhibits will have been added to the grounds which seemed rather spacious by Singapore standards.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/04/87/47/b8/markus1995.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r202400249-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

You need to pay an entry fee to enter but there's really nothing to see in there. Not impressive at all. The buiding itself, how it was built, the technicalities of how they keep it heated/cooled in there, is amazing. But that's something you can find out on Discovery Channel.

Gardens by the Bay,ChristinaAbba,A huge man-made garden,30,30-Mar-14,"From a man-made garden perspective, this is a top-ranked one but if you're more into nature and natural stuff, this place is not really your cup of tea. There are two conserved areas which are two big dome-shaped glass houses where they house rare plants and species and there's a man-made waterfall inside. I didn't have enough time during my time there and did not personally think it actually worth the price of the entrance ticket (quite pricey) so i didn't go inside the domes. I did go for the tree top walk (again there are some man made tree structures and they put a walk-way connecting the trees where you can walk) which offered a pretty good view on top.Unless you're a local and generally looking for places to stroll by for a walk you'd want to come again.

Gardens by the Bay,GreenUnicorn,Highly Overrated and Overpriced,30,22-Mar-14,"To visit the Singapore Botanic Gardens, we spent a whopping $12, which included the MRT both ways, $1 each for the orchid gardens, and 4 Coke Zeros from the vending machine. Fabulous flowers and gardens!!!By way of contrast, admission to Gardens by the Bay is $28 per person plus $5 each for the Super Tree walk, which we greatly enjoyed. The super trees are whimsical, and the walkway provides some interesting photo ops.The whole place seemed manufactured to be a waterfront attraction. The cloud was basically a waterfall plus lots of politically correct climate feel bad stuff.Also we didn't get the whole War of the Roses exhibit, as do many of the flowers were not roses!I had just finished a book on olive oil, so I was excited to see 1000 year old olive trees until I actually saw them......stuck in the dome.And how about the stalagmites and stalactites that had been removed from their place of origin and plopped in a dome?It reminded me of a sad zoo, with plants and formations wrenched from their natural environment.

Gardens by the Bay,polo1969,A nice walk around,30,21-Mar-14,"Whilst we enjoyed the walk around and the outside gardens were pleasant enough (and free) - I think the dry weather in Singapore over recent months has probably affected them from being their best.The walk that takes you around the sculptures (the huge baby is certainly worth seeing and I loved the giant dragon fly's) and down along the lagoon toward Marina Bay is enjoyable. I wouldn't bother walking the sky-walk, expensive for a few minutes of slightly better views...The cloud dome was impressive, especially the waterfall as you first enter and the range of plants, orchids, ferns etc was enjoyable to see. Some people visiting seemed oblivious to the purpose of the exhibits and saw it as a race to get through it seemed? The views toward the city through the glass dome were quite amazing, especially as the sun started to set.We went to the flower dome as it was getting dark, and although it was worth seeing, it was not as impressive to me (though the ancient olive trees and bottle trees were amazing.....I assume they were real - but hard to be certain!). As it was getting dark, the lighting in here also made the flowers less impressive (to my eyes) as they were a bit hard to see the real colour.All up, an enjoyable experience, though I would think it will improve over time as the gardens get more established. So, average in some parts to very good in others is my rating.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/05/99/6d/db/polo1969.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r198118266-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

The floor is cemented and there are plenty of pots and fenced areas with various plants inside them. A little like Changi airport.The other dome, called cloud forest is a little more interesting.

Gardens by the Bay,SheilaKaur,"Imaginative display of multi-altitude plants, but lacking something...",30,9-Mar-14,"Seems like its a showcase of plants living together, coming from different parts of the globe, encased within a biosphere to reflect climatic conditions at different latitudes...I think that's the main theme. Which of course has good resonance in our globalised era... However something about it just lacked...I guess, cohesion. Most of the indoor staff seem to come from China, it would have been more cohesive to the storyline if they staff reflected the theme of the distinctively heterogenous (globalised) plantscape. There were several display rooms, one with a video on climate change, which I did not stick around to watch cos it seemed more propaganda-ish than celebratory of the victory of plant-scape, which is what I thought the whole place was about.Entry fees were a bit steep for what it offered , about 20SGD ++.I tried the hawker centre and the food was average.

It's not that there hasn't been a lot of money spent here. It's more that the hype (and expectation) doesn't match the reality. I won't say that you shouldn't visit here when you get tired of shopping, but we had a much better time visiting the Singapore Botanical Gardens. The Botanical Gardens are a little trickier to get to, but are much more worth your effort.If you can, have a look at the ""light show"" at the Gardens by the Bay. It is good but isn't awe inspiring.

We decided to venture into both paid observatories (both air-conditioned) since it was our first time there.One observatory had many plants and flowers. Till today, I am still clueless of what I saw in the second observatory except for a simulated waterfall and a 6 floor high suspended walk. Both my kids love it as they are oblivious to heights. I have to admit I am not able to appreciate the plants from different countries there and after a while everything looks about the same. A place for botanist then? I do not think so.There is also a children's park there which was good ... and less taxing in the pocket (i.e. free). I noticed there were many local expatriates there who have learnt the local customs - go for only cheap and good. The gardens itself is free. However, in order to see more, you will have to navigate under the Singapore sun. Now, if only the young plants could just grow a tad faster.The observatories are worth a visit (note: singular) for locals and tourists.

Gardens by the Bay,2NO-mad,"Do not call it ""gardens.""",30,23-Jan-14,"Gardens by the Bay in Singapore is one of those attractions you will want to see while visiting the city. However, do not expect too much and do not be deceived by its name. It felt more as large cemented spaces with some plants around than actually proper gardens. The gigantic artificial trees which have been there for about a couple of years and which are supposed to be the main attraction, have yet to be covered by vines to the top. It gives the impression that the project has not worked that well. While you stroll around under the hot sun with little shade for protection, be aware of the vehicles taking tourists around. Whenever there is a wide path, there most likely will be a mini-bus driving by. What surprised me is how fast they drive, considering all the children running about. About price, well, the park itself is free, but you pay for all ""extras"": the green houses, the tour to the top of the giant trees, the mini-buses, etc, etc. In the end, it adds up. As for food, I was not too impressed with what there was on offer, but what you will find is the average tourist food typical of touristic attractions anywhere in the world. On bathrooms, there are not many in the middle of the park and these are small. I had to use one of these early in the morning when there were not so many people at the park yet. It had only 2 cubicles: one was for squatting and the other for handicapped people. And it was filthy. Overall, though, I'd say go and check it out. But if you really want to see beautiful, real gardens, go to theSingapore Botanic Gardens.

Gardens by the Bay,Allison_WongSW,Supertrees and Man Made Waterfall are the stand outs...,30,7-Dec-13,"We took the MRT and got off the Bayfront station in order to get to the gardens. It was quite a walk but the beautiful scenery of the gardens and the Marina Bay Sands are more than enough to make up for it. The Supertrees Grove is the stand out of gardens with tree-like structures called Supertrees that dominate the Gardens' landscape with heights that range between 25 metres (82 ft) and 50 metres (160 ft). The Supertrees are beautiful especially when they light up in the night. Since we got there quite late in the evening, we only managed to visit 1 garden so we picked the Cloud Forest since reviews seems to be more favourable than the Flower Dome. The ticket was S$16 for non-Singapore residents which I thought it was quite expensive. The main attraction of this garden is the 35-metre (115 ft) man made waterfall. We spent a lot of time taking pictures in front of the waterfall but as for the rest of the forest they were kinda bland with mainly tropical plants found all over the earth. Nonetheless, the garden was very well designed with interesting pathways all the way up from the top to different levels of the ""forest"". The last part of garden before exiting was ""5 degrees"" featuring an video show on what will and might happen if the temperate of the planet rises with an average of 5 degrees Celsius due to global warming, which I found it interesting since environmental issues are always quite close to my heart.Overall, Cloud Forest was a cool place to visit, literally cool because of the waterfall which provides cool air all over.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-a/02/de/98/a4/cylia82.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r186960268-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

The cloud forest is a huge greenhouse conservatory with a man-made waterfall and linked pathway leading you up and then down again. Along the way you will see a mini hill of flowers and plants. But if you happen to go on days with many tourists you can;t take good pictures and it will be a bit cramped.As for the flower dome, it showcases different species of flowers.

It is just a short walk into the garden.One can pretty much finish touring the outdoor garden in 30 min.The indoor gardens are better, but there is entrance fee for all.The indoor waterfall is nothing spectacular. One should visit the waterfall in the Jurong Bird Park which is way better.Ladies are advised not to wear skirts for this visit.

The walk from MRT to entrance to domes is not super far but will certainly make you sweat if you do it at noon.The flower dome was well laid out, plenty of blooms but you would be hard pressed to spend more than 30-45 mins in there. The rain forest was interesting but I couldn't help feeling some of the plants look a little stressed... Brown leafed sections of the trees. I guess they are still feeling their way round what works in this environment and what doesn't. The display of multiple hacked off stalagmites ands stalatites from "" caves all over the world"" really didn't appeal to me as they just looked like dried out white crystalline objects. What a pity they weren't left in their original locations where they had been for thousands of years. Bizarre.So we spent maybe one hour in the domes and for me SGD 56 seemed just a tad expensive.

Unfortunately quite a few of the larger trees are dead and some of the plants are diseased. (I am a gardener so I am picky!)

The gardens outside are free-of-charge, but you need to pay to enter the Cloud Dome, Flower Dome, and the Skywalk amongst the 'Supertrees' that light up at night. There's a waterfall in the Cloud Dome, and it's supposed to showcase the different vegetation found at varying elevations, i.e. you climb up the 'mountain' and see what grows on each level. The flower dome has flowering plants from various countries, and there's usually a big central display. There were also impressive carvings of various birds such as eagles when I went - I actually liked those better than most of the flowers!All in all, it's nice to visit, but a bit pricey for a garden that feels rather artificial.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/5d/db/20/royalbutterfly.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r180156810-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

There are many species of plants around and it is quite informative. The tress are splendid to see after dark and are a delight to watch during the light and sound show. You can also climb inside the tree for a fee of SGD 10. The sky walk ( tree connector ) provides a good view.There are couple of domes as well which are a decent visit if u are into plants and stuff. It was not my thing really so I wasnt much impressed. My friends liked it though.

Told by lady at ticket desk it wasn't worth getting tickets for flower dome or sky walk, so bought tickets for cloud dome. This was lovely and atmospheric even though lighting was very low and interpretation was minimal ( we didn't have audio guide and signs are not very visitor friendly). Still, a nice if slightly expensive experience. We had dinner in decent restaurant - but like Docklands in Melbourne - no one is around and there is no vibe, despite spectacular setting. After dinner wander through Super Trees and gardens pleasant and we enjoyed the lighting and displays. But trouble really set in when we realised we were not going to be able to get a taxi back to our hotel. It's like the Dead Zone!

The Gardens is one of them.The outdoor gardens are free and nice for a walk when the sun is not scorching hot. As with everything else in Singapore, they are very well maintained.At night, there are two light shows at the Supertree Grove which provides better appreciation of the 'fake' trees - metal structures with real climbing plants compared to seeing them in the daytime. Great for photography. For a fee, you can go up to the sky walkway linking the trees.The two conservatories can be visited for a fee - not cheap. Go for both for a small discount. Best to give them a miss if you don't have much time to truly appreciate the flowers and plants. I managed to squeeze in the Flower Dome before my bus trip home. If you want to photograph flowers, best to have a macro lens.In the evenings, joggers and cyclists can be seen using the space between the gardens and Marina Bay Sands.

It was also very sunny with few shaded areas, so it was hot and humid to walk around. There were also flying insects, so it might be wise to wear repellant. I noticed the groundskeepers were wearing mosquito netting, and dengue fever billboards were posted on our approach to the gardens.The indoor air conditioned gardens were a bit expensive, but nicer than walking around the outdoor areas. If you plan to go, definitely plan to visit the indoor gardens and bring an umbrella for shade for walking the outdoor spaces.

These take millions of years to form... Also had a picture in my mind of the engineers pilfering plants from the Genting Highlands for their project. There is a strong mouldy smell in some places.

Gardens by the Bay,PJ_SYD,A bit of a mixed bag,30,26-Aug-13,"Having watched the gardens slowly take shape over a number of years it was great to finally be able to visit the finished product during my visit to Singapore. However, I felt a little disappointed by various aspects of this attraction after my visit. Whilst large and impressive, the gardens felt poorly maintained on closer inspection - both with the plants themselves and also parts of the landscaping/ornamentation. I was actually a little shocked by this considering how well maintained Singapore is in general and considering that the gardens have only been open for about a year. For example, there were lots of large terracotta statues dotted around the gardens with holes and/or broken off ears & tails, etc. and there were even a few dead trees in the Cloud Forest dome. I bought tickets to visit both domes and enjoyed wandering around both but thought they were a little overpriced as I didn't stay long. You can get 10% off the domes' admission price if you show your SIA boarding pass.

Gardens by the Bay,Kitty B,Giant garden but too unreal,30,21-Aug-13,"The name of the garden was so attractive at first but I was a little disappointed after the visit. It is very spacious and I guess for Singaporean, it must be a great spot to hang out with friends, bring in kids for cycling or picnic in the big lawn. However, no matter how much it looks so Great in the Flower Doom and Cloud Forest, it is still look abit too unreal. Maybe I am a traditional visitor and would still prefer the old style of botanic garden. You better prepare at least 3 hours if you like gardening to walk through the whole garden. Don't forget the sun cream and have enough water with you.

Gardens by the Bay,Lava_Trek,Beautiful but not a natural feel,30,16-Aug-13,"The gardens are a welcome retreat from a bustling city. However, my kids liked hiking and walking in Singapore's Southern Ridges and Chinese Garden parks over the contrived park. For instance, my 8 year old said ""why is this an Indian Garden? It talks about Indian culture instead of the plants!"" There were some educational information about plants in the less visited areas but not enough to make it worthwhile. Canopy walk is literally from exactly one super tree to another and $5 seemed extravagant. Try treetop and canopy trail along the Southern Ridges of Singapore - long paths, free and a true feeling of being one with nature.

I agree with another reviewer's comment: more foliage than floral. Pretty flowers were few and far between. The educational posters in each of the garden areas (e.g Indian, Chinese, Malaysian, Colonial) might have been interesting except they did not seem to be much related to the nature around them. The supertrees definitely stand out -- I'm undecided about if they are really interesting though or just plain ugly.

That word is naff and that's what the interior of these buildings are. Naff.The building itself is impressive but under the surface it's not that good which is pretty indicative of Singapore as a whole.The cloud forest is a huge lump of concrete with vegetation growing on the outside of it that you can walk through and around and up and out of etc etc. You you've never seen a flower before of walked around a tall structure then you might be impressed otherwise it's naff. Some nice flowers are growing on it here and there but mostly its just green shrubbery with water vapor misting around it. And that's about it. The whole thing is just one huge water shrouded garden trellis you might grow in your backyard.The flower dome is a much nicer and has a range of flowers from some parts (not everywhere, just some parts) of the world but again, nothing special. It appeared to be a place designed for marriage photos and receptions. (Singapore is exclusively focused on and designed to make money, nothing is free).So if you want a pleasant air conditioned environment to waste a few hours then this place is ok but otherwise don't waste your time and go to country that has a proper flower show.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/de/5a/default-avatar-2020-36.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r170551227-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Michael D,This is not for Everyone,30,30-Jul-13,"Their is no doubt that the structure and architectural aspects are incredible however my personal opinion is that unless plants are really your thing most people will find this attraction is a little overrated. Their are two main covered areas ""the Flower Dome"" and "" the Cloud Forest"" , beside those there are some water features and and outdoor mini attractions .First of all try and avoid visiting in the morning as you will not get the benefit of the lighting and the backdrop of the city skyline . During the day the gardens can be a little bland.Second be prepared for a lot of walking especially if you want to see the outdoor attractions. Both the flower garden and the cloud forest can be covered in under 40 minutes walking at a leisurely pace. By the way if you do make it all the way to the Secret Garden at the top level of the cloud forest during the daytime you will be very disappointed as there is hardly anything there. At night the city skyline as a backdrop provides an interesting view.

Gardens by the Bay,Sylvia C,Air-conditioned gardens in a tropical country,30,10-Jul-13,"Flower DomeThis man-made garden somehow reminds me of the world-famous Burchart Garden in Victoria, Canada. It is just amazing how the horticulturists in Singapore are able to set up an indoor garden full of exotic plants and flowers (mostly temperate) in a tropical country. These plants are mostly (if not fully) imported and transplanted from different continents around the world. There is a display of colourful floral arrangements as the centrepiece; you will also see several gigantic baobabs and centennial olive trees. I must say that the Californian Garden looks rather pathetic. Except for some dry and withering California lilacs, there is nothing much representing native Californian plants.Cloud ForestVisit this place if you would like to see some waterfall and tropical plants up-close without hiking up into a real forest.ConclusionThis tourist attraction probably serves its educational purposes well; but if you prefer somewhere spacious for the kids to relax and hang around a little longer, this might not be the right place for you.

Gardens by the Bay,Mauzie2,Gardens by the bay - clever design.,30,24-Jun-13,Gardens by the Bay are an interesting engineering feat. The Super Trees are a clever design feature. The gardens arebcery well maintained but a little too clinical for my liking. I prefer a more natural garden setting.The restaurants inside the garden are very good. We also went up to the top of a Super Tree for a drink and to see the view. Expensive but worthwhile.It is free to walk around the garden with entrees fees charged to go onto the orchid dome.

Great free thing for everyone to do. I found it by accident - I wanted to walk near the waterfront and found lots of posters hanging from street lighting advertising the gardens by the bay. There are a lot of free parts of the garden to look round, but you can also buy tickets for separate areas like the inside botanicals, and for super tree - walk at same height or just below the tall trees and get a different view of the gardens and I presume the surrounding area. My favourite area was the Colonial area where there was info on loads of spices brought over and what influence they had on Singapore like peppercorn (the term peppercorn rent comes from people using peppercorn as a type of currency back in the day, and people used to have sacks of peppercorn in their houses), also learning about what different herbs mean to Chinese medicines and Hinduism.-A couple of nice metalic sculptures around too like giant dragonfly in the water.-Nice surrounding area like the arts and science museum (didn't go in but impressive building from the outside), a fancy shopping mall which enables you to go right up to the top gardens for a small fee, and the helix bridge - the whole area is recently done up",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/ea/default-avatar-2020-63.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r164592204-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Not sure I would've bothered if we hadn't been driving, though, as you can see the trees from a distance. One if the prettier sites I visited, actually.We had borrowed a vehicle that day, so be aware they charge parking by the minute. Also, saw lots of cranky kids at the gardens that night.

Reserved the table - they were strict - had to fit into their slots of either 11:30am or 1:30pm, and told that they would hold table for only 5 minutes (this is not very friendly). Had dim sum and dishes - they had 'run out' of chicken by our 11:30am lunch (!). Overall, was a pleasant meal for our 4 adults 3 kids. Lobster porridge was a highlight.Ticketing experience was horrible. After reaching the counter after the queue, was told that I had to show them the ID of all adults (family was having lunch downstairs at the Majestic!)!. Totally inflexible and I had to leave the counter without tickets as I had only my ID with me. I can understand they had 2 prices - a cheaper one for Singaporeans and residents, and a higher price for foreigners - but they have to think of a way to make the ticket purchase experience more friendly. [Had gone to their website for online purchase earlier in the day, but the system did not work.]Flower Dome was not much of a blast for me. Cloud Forest was good - highlight being the waterfall and misty atmosphere.Took an awfully long (and hot) walk to Supertree Dining, but was quite disappointed with the selection there.

You enter huge dome with large waterfall which makes for nice pictures. You go up with elevator to top nd then graduallycome down. People scared of heights may have some unease about the walkways winding down. overall nice picture possibilities (also of Sands hotel), but not that much that blew us away.

That would make sense, since Singapore is an island country and had to dredge up the land from the sea, but at same time, there is an MRT station relatively near. There are wide paths for biking and jogging, which is really helpful in such a cramped city in an urban atmosphere.The two times I've been here, there it has been packed with tourists, but I don't really know why. To get to the jungle bridges connecting the trees, you have to pay for that.

Trees are too small to offer adequate shade as compared to the Botanic Gardens or other parks in the world. There is also hardly any placed to shelter from the rain. However, the best time to imerse in the ambience of lights is during sunset where 2 light-shows accompanies the setting sun. One at 7.45pm and the other an hour later. The Super Tree by Indochine restaurant is worth a visit where one can experience a panoramic view of the city on the 4th level rotating outdoor bar (alas the rollers were not yet functional at the point of my visit in March'13).

Gardens by the Bay,mcd69paul,A nice place to spend a several hours.,30,26-Mar-13,"We started in the Flower dome and the was the best of the 2 domes in my opinion. We would have been inside the flower dome for 2.5 hours as it is easy to walk around and view the various flowers and so much more from all around the world. It is cool so some people who are sensitive to cool temperature might want to bring a light jacket or sweater. There is a restaurant in the Flower Dome that has $35 hamburgers too rich for my blood! I would recommend to bring a lunch or eat at the Bakerzin which is out in the lobby area between the 2 domes. They have a limited menu but an excellent burger for $18 which seems cheap after the $35 one inside the dome. I mention the food only because you can spend so much time in each dome you are bound to be hungry and there are limited, very limited choices to eat. The Cloud Forest has a water fall as you walk in the door and is can be a bit chilly. This dome takes a good 2 hours to fully enjoy all that is inside. If you go you will enjoy. Signage for where to enter could be improved as we came in by public transportation and had to walk a short distance.

Gardens by the Bay,JodyNg,Overcrowded park,30,21-Mar-13,"Singapore is a small city so you can't expect a lot of scenic views (even if they are artificially set up). In my opinion the place is too crowded hence I couldn't enjoy having a peaceful stroll in the park or taking photos. It may be because at the time I visited the place it had just been opened, so tourists flooded to the garden.It is within waking distance from Marina Bay Sands and there are two main green houses apart from the usual park. I paid $40 for two entrances and the houses inside are quite nice. One house has a lot of flowers (from all over the world) and the other has a mountain structure where you can walk up high and have a bird-eye view.It could have been a more enjoyable visit if there had not been too many visitors.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/c8/0c/25/alittlesoul.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r155209033-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

But GBB is a very rushed development by the same ministry that runs the country's asthetic infrastructures and its many parks.This is a basically man made garden that is south of the CBD and the new MBS or MBFC (Marina Bay Financial Centre) and the whole plot sits on reclaimed land, just beside the sea!There are two huge garden theme domes, and each has its unique features. Entry to either of these domes are payable, about $12 each, $20/pax for going for both.I gave an average rating because if you really like gardens, Singapore's Botanical Gardens with rich history and natural blooms, beats GBB hands down!!

Gardens by the Bay,The86Robsons,Feels like a theme park - overly manicured,30,15-Mar-13,"We visited the gardens in February this year, our initial thoughts were that the gardens felt like a theme park with wide walkways and overly manicured gardens. It felt very man made. That been said it was an interesting place to visit and still very beautiful.Visitors coming via MRT (Bayfront MRT station) must walk for approx 15-20mins before arriving at the ticketing area of the conservatory.There are two air-conditioned conservatory ""Flower Dome"" and ""Cloud Forest""We were impressed by the Cloud Forest but less impressed by the Flower DomeThe Flower Dome includes gardens from around the world. There is a big function hall to rent we commented that if you planned to get married in Singapore that would be a very beautiful place to hold your wedding reception.Cloud Forest: this conservatory took inspiration from Southeast Asia's lush rainforest. You are welcomed by a five story waterfall, you then take a lift to the top floor and slowly make your way down the walkways exiting at the bottom. The hanging walkway is great for taking photos. On the lower level is the ""theatre"" offering free show about global warming and the effect on nature. The temperature inside this cloud forest is cooler with higher humidity than the flower dome.From the domes if you exit at the back and take the elevators down you can walk up to a newly developed hawker centre and have satay - much cheaper than the food outlets in the gardens and a bit more real.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/3d/5b/5c/123jen123.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r154595841-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

I do think that the vines and creepers will eventually cover them, but they didn't look very nice when I was there the last time.On the plus side, it's a great idea - I'm all for gardens and greenery and nature.

The vast concrete walkways disturb the picture of a botanic garden, and the supertrees are more scaffold than plant.

Split out into different countries/regions, the plants were put together somewhat haphazardly (some just in pots clumped together) and they weren't very well signposted. Still, it was very clever the way the dome was designed to cater for different climates of the various regions. We visited before Chinese New Year, and Year of The Snake decorations were scattered around the garden, which was very nice.The Cloud Dome was nice, even though my first impressions of the man-made waterfall was that it looked like a couple of drainpipes over a carpark! But, when we started to explore, it was interesting to see the different levels of a forest canopy and the walkways were fun.What I especially liked were the environmental education activities and information. It would be good to take children there so they could learn about sustainability.

Take a cap along if you would like to shield yourself from the sun from the mrt station to the conservatories as the path is not covered. The palms and fir do not seem to be doing so well (same as the possums in the Night Safari) outside their natural habitat as much as one tries to simulates the environment. The flower garden is quite colorful in the flower dome. The waterfall in the Cloud Forest is quite impressive when you enter the conservatory. The Secret Garden display is quite nicely done informing visitors how the gardens are maintained. The admission prices is quite steep compared to the free entry lovely Botanical Gardens which has thriving plants.

There is also a Malay garden, that symbolizes the Malay culture located near to the super grove trees opp food courtWhat It Offers?: two conservatories, that is home to tropical plants and trees. Entry fee is imposed. Senior citizen and children concession are available. The flower Dome, has a Michelin chef star rated restaurant located inside. Entry fee to the OCBC Skywalk, a suspension bridge between super grove trees, that offers you 360 degree view of the garden, river and marina bay sands. For elderly people and pregnant ladies, use the garden cruiser to get you around the gardens. Its 5$ per person.Restaurants: There are lot of private restaurants in and around information counter, which are bit pricey. We preferred to goto the food court located near the OCBC Skywalk. From the Info counter, walk straight towards the taxi stand and turn right near the small conceirge to the elevators. There is collection of western food, traditional chinese food, pizza and pasta shop, coffe shop. Prices are average and choices limited.Garden Signatures: Everywhere you walk and see, you will find varieties of orchids smiling at you, some fruit trees, rows of sugarcanes near the drangon fly lake, the Artificial super grove trees are quite tall, with orchids, flowers and climbers, covering them like second skin with sprinklers sticking out. Its quite a sight to see, when sprinklers work, during early morning hours. Opposite the Skywalk you will find 2 sets of lion heads on the wall, with water flowing through their mouths, exactly to the gap on the floor below. The boardwalks near the lake is quite relaxing. The Gift shop at Garens are very unique. I have never seen such collection of jewelleries, souvenir's, tea's (yes, they taste good and try the demo), handicrafts and memorabilia's at affordable prices. Recently, the restaurant is open on top of the supergrove tree near to the dragon fly lake. There is a small beach setting near to the river side, closer to the Marina Bay Sands area, which looks different to the garden theme.Best Time: Before 9 am in the morning or after 3 pm in the afternoon. On a cloudy day, can even go as early as 10 am. Advisable not to go after 10 am on a hot sunny day, specially if you are a newbee and dont know the routes well, you will be cursing just to find the Information counter walking a long way in hot sun, as there are no sunshades along the footpath anywhere in the garden. Wear comfortable flat shoes or flip flops, ladies avoid high heeled shoes, as you will be carrying them in your hands after some time. Keep umbrellas with you. note rest rooms are near the Info counter at landing of dragon fly bridge and then at the Main information counter, and at the food court. Please carry a water bottle in hand, as there are no water taps located along the path. You can also take taxi from the taxi driveway located adjacent to the information counter. On weekends, its quite crowded, so stroll towards the helix bridge near Marina Bay Sands and after you cross the first set of Ayer rajah highway bridge, there is a small lane to Tower 3 driveway of the MBS hotel and you get a taxi there easily.Pros of the Garden: Unique flora settings, super grove trees, lush & different varieties of flowers and plants, good scenic and photograpic places. The theme and the logo dragonfly will be seen everywhere, including well maintained rest rooms.Cons: pricey restaurants, signanges along the routes needs precised informations (E.g -walk to information counter/ticket booth 1 km ), Maps along the path to guide you. No Water taps along the foot path, rest room availability at other location.Verdict: A must place for people with passion towards the nature. For locals, well you can try different aspect lesuirely at various times, since there is no entry fee or time restriction as garden is open 22 hrs everyday. For Tourists, if it fits your time and schedule, DONT MISS IT.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/69/3f/9e/flamingred007.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r150986223-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,j_herliani,Man-Made Nature!,30,22-Jan-13,"Gardens By The Bay, being one of the newer additions to the attractions in Singapore, captures the government's effort in further maintaining Singapore's title as a ""Garden City"". The garden itself is free entry however, you will have to pay a fee of SGD$28 standard admission to the two indoor conservatory domes - Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. In addition, the OCBC Skyway cost SGD$5 per adult in order to enter. The entrance ticket to the two domes are rather expensive in my opinion, but your trip will definitely not be complete without exploring the domes!Personally prefer the Cloud Forest (moist) as compared to Flower Dome (dry), based on individual preferences. The main feature of the Cloud Forest will have to be the waterfall area, in addition, the domes are a good place to escape from the heat at the gardens since temperature are kept cooling in the dome. On the other hand, Flower Dome pales as compared to the Cloud Forest. It has interesting flower displays though which will change accordingly to seasons.If you're intending to make a trip to the Gardens By The Bay, remember to wear light clothings especially if you're planning to go there in the afternoon! The heat can get unbearable at times. Of course, I would suggest going during the evening time as it will be much more cooling and the view will be more magnificent with the lightings as well..",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f4/d0/default-avatar-2020-33.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r150254591-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

As an Australian, the large range of native Australian plants did not interest me.We did a quick walk around the outside gardens which are not yet established.Maybe I will go back in a few years time.There were some huge petrified tree trunks that were interesting.The light show was a disappointment although the music was quite nice and reminded us of the movie Avatar.Overall, I wouldn't recommend it but it is an attraction that can be visited in the rain.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/89/avatar010.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r150071779-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

The ticket is rather pricey and for foreigners, you have to buy both, can not just choose one. Flower Dome is a place where there are plants...that basically it. Nothing much to see...sorry to say, since I am not a big fun of plants. For Cloud Forest, not so bad, when entering the area, the waterfalls will be the 1st thing we see, this Cloud Forest is more interesting...the area is cool and had a number of nice pictures spots. We will be like doing a little hiking and see the nice views surrounding. The construction of the buildings are amazing...very nice architecture.

Cloud Forest is a must go and is a wonderful experience - even more so if you didnt know what it was and strolled in. Its the thing to see in the gardens. Flower Dome was disappointing.

Gardens by the Bay,jzkim,"Futuristic Garden, Confusing Signs, Don't Love It.",30,2-Jan-13,"Gardens by the Bay came highly recommended to us on our recent visit to Singapore. Perhaps we visited the wrong time in the day - we went in the morning and I heard it is better at night - it was disappointing. The setting is very futuristic. If the movie Bladerunner featured a garden, it would look like this. In fact, there is a scene from Serenity that looked just like it. Novel and interesting perhaps, but it doesn't stir the soul. Or, I should say, it stirs the soul wrong. The word cold comes to mind. The other beef I had with this garden was that the signs were confusing. If you have time for only one garden in Singapore, go to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. There you can see real, old growth trees (rather than the interesting but monstrous fake tree). There, you can imagine what the island used to look like. The Botanic Gardens is charming.

We expected quite a bit of colour and vibrancy. I guess we have some amazing gardensin Australia, so I may have been comparing. If you are from Singapore , or other parts of the world with limited garden areas, this attraction would be stunning for you. The fake waterfall, while large in structure, was not particularly exciting for us as in Australia we have real waterfalls which are bigger and far more beautiful. We have local garden nurseries which are more spectacular. I did however appreciate the climate education and awareness campaign going on there and I think this could be a really exciting approach if taken further. In the meantime, perhaps the designers could consider highlighting the beautiful varieties of orchids, so common in this part of Asia. We were disappointed that they weren't throughout the exhibits.I think in a year or two this place could be quite spectacular once things have grown to potential and once they harness what the actual purpose of the attraction is.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/ec/2e/05/choops3163.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r148482307-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,walniw w,The Light Display that never happened,30,29-Dec-12,"I organized a trip for a bus load of 40 pax to the Gardens By The Bay. The 2 domes were nothing to rave about as what we did was just follow the crowd and walked along the one way path. There were hardly any colorful flowers, just plants and plants. Nothing for us to be excited about taking photos with.I arranged the bus to pick us after 8pm as I wanted my group to stay for the 7:45pm light display.The music and announcement came on and we all strained our neck and waited for the lights to come on.... The music continued for another 10 mins, but nothing else happened. The whole thing ended as abruptly as it started. I told my group who were wondering what we have missed, that something was not right. I called the customer service office which was said to be opened till 9 pm but no one answered my call. I wanted to know what is happening, but I got no answer. We waited hoping there would be some form of apology of announcement, but none came. As the bus was waiting, we left disappointed. I especially felt let down as I was the organizer to the trip and was telling my group about the light display, but that never happened.I wrote in to express my disappointment and I got a reply saying there was some technical problem and also the PA system was down. What about the call I couldn't through? Why no officials came to tell the waiting crowd? I told them luckily we were locals that could afford the time to make another trip although we might not.

Gardens by the Bay,yumfix,Great... but only if you're into plants...,30,19-Dec-12,"We had some time to kill and decided to stop by the two domes we kept seeing as we traversed the island. What's great about it is that it is a very well designed and maintained attraction. All man made and impressive when one thinks about the logistics to bring in the plants from all over the world. The domes are air-conditioned and that on its own is also quite an amazing feat of engineering. Having said that, I think I was impressed for all of 15 seconds as I entered the first dome and then I was quickly looking for a way to walk though it all fast.If you are into plants and gardening, you'll love it. My mum did because she has green fingers. For the rest of us, it got boring pretty quickly. It could be a very educational experience if you take your time and choose to make it so. If you're considering taking your family there you might want to think about what everyone might make of it. It isn't something all would appreciate.

We wanted to catch a taxi back to our hotel after enjoying our visit to the gardens. We stood in line for almost half an hour without making any progress before deciding to walk back. Every taxi was ON CALL which means they can charge extra. Taxis were pulling up ON CALL and people were climbing in without any names or references appearing to be exchanged. We made use of the helpful (?) notice nearby and kept calling the various companies to book a taxi. All were engaged. I don't know what the solution is. How would we know which taxi was for us even if we had managed to book one? The locals we spoke to in the queue weren't happy with the situation either. The Gardens by the Bay are lovely and worth visiting but my husband's birthday treat wasn't the enjoyable experience I had hoped it would be thanks to the shambles with the taxis and our long walk back.

So I paid sg$23 for both domes( it's discounted tickets through local travel agent, official price is $28 but $20 for SG permanent residents).To be frank, though the dome is designed very user-friend but really not much to see inside, I didn't see much flower blossom in flower dome, nor rare species of flowers. Forrest dome is designed well and get u a bit surprise also shared lots of environmental knowledge. The man-made waterfall is a bit rare indoor. So if u have to visit one dome, I would suggest Forrest dome.Garden itself is not large but well designed and maintained. Very easier for all ppl walk. OCBC skywalk looks cool but when I was there, it was closed due to drizzle.Transportation is very convenient, just took Circle line and drop at bay front station for around 5min lovely walk with oversight of MBS and the garden before u arrive.

Gardens by the Bay,Godwit,Unique but scary,30,16-Nov-12,"There is nothing like this in the world. Whether you like it or not is a matter of personal taste. My most frequent thought was 'How much did all this cost?' and 'Why?' rather than 'How beautiful this is'.I was however rather overcome (almost literally) by the route we took to get there. On our map there seemed to be a way from the Sands Hotel shopping complex across the motorway, and indeed there is. You start from about 4 floors up. There is a sign to the Gardens pointing up a long escalator. You arrive at a landing faced by another very long escalator over about an 30 meter drop. Nothing on either side but space. Now I'm not the greatest lover of heights so I looked for a way down again. There isn't one. No down escalator and no lift. You have to go up this very scary one. With my wife's help I made it.You end up on a very windy roof (the wind had blown the sign posts over) but at least there was a lift. Having been through so much we decided to press on and crossed the motorway bridge. On the far side there are some long escalators back down again. However after my wife did a reconnaissance we found a lift to ground level. Phew! Now the gardens have a number of extremely vertiginous walkways so perhaps this is their way of sorting the visitors out!Having got to this point I was determined to find a different way back and the answer is the MRT. The entrance to the new MRT 'Bayfront' station (CE1) is at the park ground level.So if you wish to go there on a less scary route take the train.Hope this help somebody.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/47/37/cc/godwit.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r145523168-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,MrCushtie,A bit sterile,30,29-Oct-12,"Halfway round the Cloud Forest, I was struck by the realisation that I was inside not a biodome, but a metaphor for Singapore itself. The interior of the Gardens By The Bay are a sterile, carefully managed environment which allows for no mess, no fuss, no dirt, no animals, just plants, carefully arranged and illuminated. The overall effect isn't so much to be awed by nature, as to feel like you're lost in a shopping mall that specialises in plants and is strangely devoid of cash registers.On the positive side, it's much cooler than outside, but really, air conditioning shouldn't be a reason for visiting somewhere. There's lots of plants, but there's a real paucity of informational signs (apart from the possibly ironic ""Secret Garden This Way"") so unless you're an assiduous botanist, you won't know what you're looking at. (Or you should have paid another $4 for the audio tour.) There's just a real lack of character.There's also a lot of slippery surfaces, because of the high humidity (provided by misters and the enormous waterfall) which mean somebody is bound to slip and hurt themselves sooner or later. Be careful how you tread.Outside is a bit better. There was an enormous queue for the sky walk when we arrived (7pm on a Sunday evening) but the outer gardens are quite pleasant to walk through at ground level - you don't really need to elevate yourself that much. Although you can go up one of the 'supertrees' and have dinner, looking down on hoi polloi beneath you, it again seems quite unnecessary; gardens should be about encountering nature, not looking down on it.The gift shop is (unintentionally?) hilarious, shelf upon shelf of tasteless knick-knacks and geegaws made out of gold, nothing whatsoever to do with gardens (unless an enormous gold carp on a piece of wood is some horticultural reference I didn't get); I assume it's there to cater to somebody who got lost in the Marina Bay Shoppes and staggered down to the Gardens, then panicked because they weren't in a soulless mercantile environment.So, in short, go to the gardens and walk around, but skip paying the entrance money (and queuing for a long time) for the domes - they're better viewed from outside than in.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/29/3c/97/mrcushtie.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r143968996-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Devilutza,Not yet mature enough,30,10-Sep-12,"I think the Gardens by the bay will be a lot better once all the plants are mature enough.

Gardens by the Bay,petiteld,A city garden with very expensive add-ons,30,10-Sep-12,"The garden opened a few months ago. To my opinion, it shows as many plants look still young and the flower / plant beds are not lushed yet - some looking even like nursery stock.A lot of asphalt, concrete, man-made buildings do not allow me to feel completely like in a real garden.The hothouses are really impressive buildings; I really like when the sails are opening to cover the glass when the sun glares. However their entrance fee (20 dollars per adult if local resident, 28 for visitors) is really too expensive and not completely worth it.The exhibits regarding climate change are childish, unclear, full of false truths and to my opinion counter-productive to a good education in environment care (to which I am in favour of in general).I would recommand a quick tour to look at the city center from the garden but to reserve the paying visit to the Orchid Garden and to allow for longer time in the Botanic Gardens than here, if you're really keen on plants and gardens that look a little like nature.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-f/02/7b/99/f8/petiteld.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r139874731-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,DaniW_86,Might be great for plant lovers,30,5-Sep-12,"I went here to have a look at the new establishment thinking it would be something very different and interesting. When arriving it looked interesting, I got my map of the gardens and started to walk around. The gardens where informative however not overally different from any others that I have been to.The charge to get into the domes was outrageous (Aug 2012 was S$28) - there was no way I was paying to see plants.I assume this would be much more enjoyed by green thumbs, however it was dissapointing for me as an average person with average interest in see gardens whilst traveling.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/eb/d8/ed/daniw-86.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r139436724-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,DavidAstley,Somewhat disappointed but should improve,30,29-Aug-12,"I visited Gardens by the Bay the week after it officially opened. I was looking forward to my visit as I had had a preview of the Flower Dome during the World Orchid Conference last December, and had been impressed with what I saw there. However I was somewhat disappointed because my interest is in tropical plants, and the Flower Dome had only Mediterranean plants on display. (I guess all the tropical orchids I had seen in there in December had only been placed there as a special display). The Flower Dome is certainly a respite from Singapore's humidity (it was constructed to replicate a warm, dry Mediterranean climate, and there are some very colorful displays of flowers, but didn't hold my interest for very long.I found the Cloud Forest cooled conservatory more interesting, but it feels much more like ""work in progress"" than the Flower Dome. This conservatory features tropical plants from the highland regions of the tropics. I also found some parts of the Cloud Forest conservatory a bit ""touristy"" but could be educational for visiting parties of school children. I don't believe that crystals have any magic properties, so that part I found a bit tacky.Considering that there is no charge to visit Singapore's magnificent botanic gardens on the north side of the city, I considered the $28 charge to visit the two conservatories a bit steep. And I was annoyed that tourists have to pay more. Having visited gardens in many countries around the world, I believe there should be one standard admission charge because these charges add a lot to the cost of a holiday. A season pass can be offered to local residents who wish to visit often. I can understand why tourist attractions in the poorer developing countries may have charge locals less, but SIngapore is such a wealthy country that a good proportion of the locals would be earning more than those visiting! And tourists over 60 should be aware that the senior citizen rate only applies to locals. Even though there is a senior citizen rate listed for tourists, it is $28 - the same as the standard tourist rate! (Why bother to list it separately?)""Work in progress"" would also be a good way to describe the free gardens outside of the conservatories and the steel ""Supertrees"" (which I assume will eventually have creepers growing right to the top). In a few years time they may be worth visiting in their own right, but at the moment the area outside of the conservatories is not on a par with the main botanic gardens.Facilities are generally good in and around Gardens by the Bay. It's a fairly long walk from the nearest MRT station in the heat, so older people may prefer to take a taxi there. The restrooms are clean and there are several food outlets. The coffee shop next to the souvenir shop has good food but is not cheap. Skip their coffee though and get one when you return to the Marina Bay shops. Their menu shows a nice Italian latte with good crema in a china cup, but what you get is a flat white coffee in a paper cup. When I was there one customers was loudly complaining that the photo on the menu was misleading and demanding that they serve her coffee in a china cup. The manager was telling her they couldn't do that because they didn't have any china cups!I've given Gardens by the Bay an 'Average' rating because it is really not yet at the stage where I would rate it as 'Very Good'. Average is not really the right description for this multi-million dollar development - probably better to call it ""Getting there slowly and may be worthy of a Very Good rating in a few years"". However, if you are interested in plants/gardens and you are not likely to return to Singapore for a few years, then I would still recommend a visit whilst you can despite its current shortcomings.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/12/4f/73/42/davidastley.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r138685237-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Osakahelen,Is just a big park !,30,27-Aug-12,"Garden by the bay - more like a big PARK area where u can go for a stroll in evening with the view of MBS( marina bay sands casino). The sky bridge is only a short distance walk that cost S$5 per pax , which I think is not worth. The two DOMES may be a good visit for those who love trees and plants, for the only interesting part is the HUGE man made waterfall within a greenhouse. And the top height have a MINI suspension bridge. Tourists entrance fee cost abt S$30 per pax. Any parts of Malaysia forest or Cameron highland, can really get to feel n touch of the nature for FREE, unless you only can spend a day or two in Singapore, properly this is a place to come after a fun air condition RIDE In flyer or for those who do not like to shop and gambles in MBS , may walk over to have some food in a park area.

Gardens by the Bay,qasr,"Unique, But Not Spectacular",30,1-Aug-12,"Got my first glimpse of this attraction when departing the airport for my hotel. It's definitely eye-catching and intriguing, those tall Supertree towers and the puffy giant glass domes. Nothing else like those trees in the Singapore skyline, nor any other skyline. I visited just as the sun was setting so that I could see the Bay South gardens all aglow when night fell, as other reviewers have described. Aside from the supertrees and a couple of nice photo spots, there's not that much to set this garden apart from others. Lots of well landscaped greenery, but most nice parks have that. There also wasn't as much lighting as I thought there would be... perhaps some of the features were being renovated? In fact, once it grew dark, you couldn't see any of the garden except for the tall supertrees. The Garden Rhapsody light show happens at 7:45 and 8:45pm; basically, the trees take turns twinkling and blinking various shades set to music and narration. If you happened to have paid $5 to be up on the Skywalk at that time, hang out there and catch the show from above. Also a great place to see the Singapore skyline. The Cloud Forest dome was closed during this visit so I can't comment on it. The ticket seller also told us that the Flower Dome would be too dark to enjoy the flowers inside, so unfortunately, I can't comment on that either.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e2/e6/default-avatar-2020-45.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r135940855-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

My favorite is The Cloud Forest... the falls and the orchids makes my day... the FLower Dome is so so... with the entrance of $12 each or $20 for 2 domes and $5 for the Skywalk.... i can say its expensive.

They need to have more counters open (only 2 on the day I went) or get modern and open self-service kiosks that would make the whole experience less frustrating. It's a real pity that this system is in place because the grounds and domes are quite enjoyable! Also, be aware you cannot buy tickets for the trees or the electric cart tours at this gate, rather ""over there"".Recommend for children, obviously, but inside the two domes it's cool and not too noisy, and I think the elderly visitors really enjoyed that.

Gardens by the Bay,lixT,Great Escape from the Heat & Humidity of Singapore for a fee of $28,30,4-Jul-12,"The place is still work in progress. The outer garden is free but you would not enjoy walking in the open air under the hot sun with all the ongoing construction going on at the surrounding area.So in order to fully appreciate the place gotta pay $ 28 to enter the aircondition conservatories - Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. By the way, the tickets are for multipler entries.Ticketing - Inefficient and hopelessly unorganized. Poor crowd management with only 2 counters open for day ticket. Some people eventually gave up after waiting for too long. When we were there, we noticed strangely that all caucasian were approached by a caucasian staff in uniform to skip the Q to purchase their ticket in a special room. When some Asian tourist asked him , he said for those who pay cash no need to Q . I was just wondering why he assume only the caucasion is paying cash and the rest of us was not offered the same privilege.For foreigner, there is no discount for senior citizen and no separate ticket available for the 2 conservatories ...Flower Dome - Plant lover would love this place which feature plants, trees and flowers from all over the world. Some of the tree were probably uprooted from its country of origin and replanted ...without any leaves or branches. I hope the trees will survive.The Cloud Forest - man made waterfall and plant (mainly fern) stuck on the wall. Not very realistic. Don't expect to see much orchid or pitcher plant as advertised. The Crystal mountain was a joke !The sky walk - $5 per adult. If you are afraid of height, skip this. Nice to go after dark to see the background comprises of Marina Sands Bay and Flyer. Don't go during peak hour as the staff will usher you and rush you through the walk to allow the second batch of people to come up.Food - strongly advise to bring your own food. The eateries were obviously not prepared to handle crowd. We ordered 2 Nasi Lemak with tea which we thought would be fast but it took forever to arrive. They were quick to take our order, slow to serve and even slower to give us our bill. The taste was average but cost us $ 30Transport - We hang around till 9pm so we decided to take a cab . There was a long Q at the taxi stand and believe it or not not even one single cab present ! Eventually everyone were forced to call a cab.

Would be so great, if they'd have taken their own concept serious and would support local businesses f.e. - keep their carbon footprint in mind. See for yourself. I am sure that this project had a big budget, so they should have been able to do better or should at least try to make it better in the future. Nice try, but try harder.

The ""Cloud Forest"" treats the unsuspecting visitor to an elevator ride to the top of a concrete construction, where they can then walk down between ferns, orchids, and LED lighting.

It was difficult to see some of the plantings and, again, super crowded. We ended up going in the evening because the day we first tried to go, only one dome was open so we wandered the free parts of Gardens by the Bay. I'm glad we ended up seeing the domes, but would not go back. If you are limited on time or money, I would skip the domes.

Surprising for Singapore to have something that isn't more accessible, but doesn't stop the crowds.Admittedly we went on a Saturday evening so maybe busier than other days.Avoid the McDonald's unless you want to be shoved in every direction and wait an eternity for your food to be made.The two greenhouses are impressive for about 3 minutes each. Then you're just looking at trees and flowers in a big greenhouse, again surrounded by rude pushy people.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r648334014-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,jeromeben,Long waiting times,20,30-Sep-18,"I recently visited the cloud forest for the third time last saturday but was very disappointed as the waiting times were upwards of 30 minutes and it was a huge waste of time for my family and I to be queueing. The last time i visited the cloud forest, a few months ago, the waiting times were still manageable and i only had to wait for 5-10 minutes at the most. I'm not sure what has changed, maybe it was more crowded than before but i also realised that previously i could have taken the staircase up to the top level and although it was quite a climb, it actually helped to cut down on the queue times. However, when i visited on saturday, i asked the staff but there was no stairs available for visitors to use, and i had to choice but to wait in line if i wanted to have a full experience of the cloud forest. I also had half to mind to just exit and be done with it. After the cloud forest, we went to visit the ocbc skyway however, the queue time was even more absurd, with the staff saying i has to queue up for more than a hour just to go up. If you're in a rush, i recommend going to the botanic gardens instead!

Gardens by the Bay,bonvoyage1011,Disappointing. Feel robbed!,20,20-May-18,"After paying $58 for 2 tickets to the domes we were expecting to be really wow'd.We went to the flower dome first and we were just so disappointed. It was rammed with tourists, selfie sticks and pushy people trying to get that perfect Instagram photo. Despite the many signs saying not to to touch the flowers and plants, so many were broken and dead from people sitting on ledges where they trail and grabbing roses for pictures. I just didn't get the attraction.. the dome is impressive and many of the plants are really beautiful, however the organisation and displays were nothing out of this world. We wandered for 20 mins or so then just had to leave.We had high hopes for cloud forest and were hoping for the trip to be salvaged! Not the case unfortunately. The queue for the dome stretched for what seemed like miles. After about a 20 minute wait we were in, and then told it was a minimum 1 hour wait to go to the top! (I should mention we went at 6pm which is perhaps peak time so that people can can catch the light show, even still, it was really terrible crowd control.) We got in, the 'mountain' is cool to look at I guess, although I couldn't get past it being a man made structure and not really sure what I was supposed to be marvelling at. Again the queuing and noise and selfies just ruined whatever nice experience we could have had.We didn't bother waiting the hour to get to the top, not sure what is up there but if it's just views of the city I'm sure there is better vantage points from elsewhere.All in all, we didn't enjoy the experience and can't really understand the hype. $28 each is WAY too much.The positives were the area is nice and the tree grove area was cool.Unless your a huge plant enthusiast or have a big budget to work off, I would give it a miss.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r581325486-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,HarrisChai,Dead Heart where Flowers Bloom,20,23-Apr-18,"The exterior looks quite impressive, while the variety of plants is commendable. The tulip display at the Flower Dome is pretty nice.But service here is horrible. Some try, but many others seem tired, irritable, and in some cases, quite cold. In open, public areas of a garden (with no exotic plant species around), my toddler was stopped from playing bubbles because 'others may be sensitive to it'. At the cloud forest, another toddler was not allowed to enter because she was drinking milk from a tiny uht packet (staff said if she was drinking from a milk bottle it was ok). If the fear was of littering, it could be better managed with bins - many of the tourists had brought in all sorts of food and drinks in their bags anyway, and often paused to consume them.Another pet peeve as an Asian, and even more so as a Singaporean - some service staff seem to favor Caucasian visitors more, which in this day and age, is ridiculous.Finally, as a safety issue, the pedestrian/jogging track behind the two domes often had speeding escooters and bicycles entering the track when the vehicle lane had the tour buggy/team on it. And seeing how many visitors kinda saw the area as an enclosed space, it was quite understandable that some stray into the vehicle and bicycle lanes, and may not be aware of the escooters and bicycles coming at them at full speed from behind. Some policing or better demarcation should be made.All-in-all, a disappointing visit.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/0d/6c/40/harrischai.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r575048481-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

The small sign when I came in to pay said, ""Today is Singel Family Day,"" when it should have read, ""Mobs of people inside. Hopelessly oversold!""But, that's just one day. More interestingly, I felt like most of the plants on display here were just kind of familiar basic rainforest plants and flowers - the kind of stuff you see at Home Depot plant department - planted alongside concrete walkways. And then the fake giant sparkly pumpkins for fall. Bordering on tacky and the plants all were the kind that you see at every botanical garden/conservatory if you're in Cincinnati or Chicago or Milwaukee or wherever.

Gardens by the Bay,mind_the_shark,Christmas wonderland,20,6-Jan-18,"We got to GBTB via Bayfront mrt on Christmas Eve. I got tickets online for Christmas wonderland and 2 conservatories. Naturally I would enter via the entrance situated nearest to the mrt but I was denied entry in the basis that my ticket needed to be redeemable only at a booth situated at the flower dome (which was a 15 Min walk) before I was able to enter Christmas wonderland. I had young children and elderly in tow and the walk was impossible, essentially I had no choice but to pay for the shuttle. I asked for some flexibility to enter Christmas wonderland and walk through it to the flower dome as I was already at the Christmas wonderland entrance but was told that's I couldn't because GBTB had no control over it as they partnered with presumably some other operator for Christmas wonderland. I don't understand why there is only one booth for redemption of tickets inconveniently located at flower dome. They should have made it more user friendly - surely it would have made sense to have a booth located near the mrt. It does not matter to the consumer whether the both was run by GBTB or another operator, the organisers should work together to create a seamless experience for visitors. Worse still, it was Christmas Eve and yet the shuttle ended at 9pm. I had to take the long walk back to the mrt which was difficult for young children and elderly.

At $24.00 (SGD) a ticket, it wasn't the most overpriced activity in Singapore and it seemed like a fun way to enjoy an afternoon in the air-conditioning. However, I would suggest you take that $24.00 and use it to buy a cocktail on top of the Marina Bay Sands and skip the crowds and chaos that are contained in these two glass domes. Inside, there are beautiful specimens of plants ' everything from Orchids to Baobab trees; there are also some beautiful pieces of sculpture placed throughout the two arboretums. However, the sad part is that one cannot actually enjoy any of these things because the crowds of people are nearly unbearable! The endless sea of selfie sticks and myriad of people who all seem to be experiencing their first pumpkin makes for a human traffic jam that won't soon be forgotten. Furthermore, many of the attractions require a queue line that most participants don't seem to understand or care about and no staff members care to enforce.If here for a short time, I would actually IMPLPORE you to skip this venue ' you won't be missing out!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/10/7c/c9/7a/kristopher-j.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r527195886-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

This is about gigantic, I mean really humungusly huge plant life, and exhibits which have been put together in a very contrived way. Most of the 'attractions' are enclosed in two massive air conditioned cage-like domes. Outside the domes it is very hot, and involves a lot of walking, and encountering some awful concrete pylons that hold the whole thing together. And after a while, large as it was, being inside a dome I had the feeling of being trapped, and of needing to escape what felt like a rather terrible zoo, but where the exhibits are plants not animals.Tip: if you must go here then go during the week.

What's worse... The park is open till 9pm, but u expect dropping off stroller by 8.30 else u will retain passport/NRIC. this is absurd, atleast allow visitor to retain till closing time. We ended up seeing nothing that day since skywalk was closed and the light show was at 8.30 and we had to return the stroller by then. Basically i would advise... Have more strollers pls..

Apparently, climbing trees in Singapore is not normal children's activities and staff rush and run to stop children.They also would not maintain the facility well so many things are broken. All staffs are only there to keep the rules and not play with children or fixing places as it needs.Still, it is huge area and many places to wonder around which is good by bicycles and Rollerblade.Connections to the each sections are not really easy to understand and easy to get lost even with the help of the map.Domes are huge but I found it is sad to see that they bring natural nature which they cannot well maintain and able to see the damages... such as Huge stalactites specifically. I love nature so I wish they did not cut and damage nature in such way.Although many of Singapore people might like the Electric tree's sounds and light performances but I just could not enjoy it at all.

The Christmas Wonderland starts at 3:30 p.m. everyday and it closes off a large part of the garden. Despite being there at 14:50, I was not allowed in and was told to get back at 15:30.

Please note that visitors are required to purchase Christmas Wonderland tickets to access Supertree Grove and Meadow from 3.30pm to 11pm from 2 Dec 2016 to 1 Jan 2017.""The tickets are sneakily priced to increase as it gets closer to Christmas. Currently they are going at $8...that's $8 to enter an area that was previously FREE. When we visited, a number of people were caught unawares. Tickets are also not sold at the door, so you HAVE to buy them online. Even though it says to print, you can just flash the QR code on your mobile.What's going on at Christmas Wonderland? They have a carnival with games stalls (starts at $4 for a fishing game) and some kiddy rides ($6 per ride), an ice skating rink ($18 per pax), snow playground ($16 per pax), musical performances on select nights, a festive market selling food, drinks, crafts and restaurants. There are also some light sculptures, the Luminarie, which were quite stunning but I could not fully appreciate this time round due to the pricey tickets. Oh, and fake snow.Even the Merry Medley display at the Flower Dome was quite lacklustre. It was very monotonous.Access to the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and Children's Garden are as per normal.

Gardens by the Bay,TomSonntag,Man made gardens with different aesthetics,20,18-Dec-16,"When we talk about garden in the west, we think flowers and nature. To reach this garden, you walk from a concrete MRT tunnel to a man made concrete landscape with concrete walks, metal structures and totally planned and artificial looking walks. Granted, the whole structure is on reclaimed land and as such a major engineering accomplishment, but not since Louis XIV did we see the idea of human dominance over nature executed in such a thought through manner. The function of the garden is, at best, postmoderne, decontextualized from its urban context. Neither commercial, nor living, nor cultural aspects are integrated parts of this project. Art for art's sake but postmodernism is a thing of the past-so is the idea of this desert by the sea",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/3d/default-avatar-2020-55.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r444916371-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Singapore is good for food and shopping. I've visited five times and now seen every tourist attraction there is to see. I'd recommend sticking to food and shopping. I've been spoilt by space and nature my whole life. This was artificial and felt like I was back at an airport. It was a hot walk over to Marina Bay Sands from Gardens by the Bay - we were soaked by the time we got there. Everyone we asked told us to walk and that getting a taxi wasn't worth it. Instead we had to buy new shirts at the mall- notably much more expensive than a taxi.We visited around 1-2pm and did not see the night lights. It's probably better at night, but I still question the price for what it is.It was also recommended that we visit Satay by the bay for affordable local delights. It appeared to be an overpriced hawkers market. Also quite a hot walk during the day.The whole thing felt like a tourist trap. But there are indeed many good reviews.

Gardens by the Bay,HamoNinja,After 11 years finally went to GBTB,20,20-Sep-16,"Though it took me years to finally head to the Gardens by the Bay (even with all my extensive years of visiting to Singapore); I finally mustered the motivation to go. In 2016.To be honest, it's nice and all but would I recommend people to go there? No not really.My experience was as follows; as with anything in life ""first impressions count"" and they did very clearly on this excursion... the staff were friendly enough, but were they engaging? No not at all. They just looked like it was just a job to them and weren't really interested about the patrons or try to get to know people visiting. They looked bored and would rather be somewhere else; even some attitudes that were very obvious that I noticed from staff in The Cloud Forest, which came through their tones when directing people. From the time I bought a $3 pass for the shuttle and throughout my 2-3hours I spent at the Gardens, it was clear the staff didn't really want to be there! Sad really.Though a lot of different things to try within, which means extra money so if you don't mind spending $40-50 on one outing then by all means; but there were probably only two things that I would recommend to try if you do go there:1. The Cloud Forest (which has the man made waterfall).2. The Indochine Restaurant (located in the Super-tree Grove).Some hot tips:If your a foreigner, then make sure you get a local friend/ family/ buddy to purchase tickets for the Cloud Forest on your behalf so much cheaper; otherwise you will be paying through the nose!Rather then do the OCBC walkway, especially if your looking for a view; instead pay $18 to go up to Indochine Restaurant which you get a free drink as well air-con with sights.This is especially compared to paying $8 for the walkway which is only from one tree to another (should have connected 2-3 trees to make a decent walkway). Also it can be quite windy on the walkway and no covering from the sun which is quite intense up there too.Now I may have possibly given a higher rating for this review if I had a chance to ride the Auto-Rider; but that was a flop as it only operates from 11am to 1pm daily which is pretty poor too.Overall I'm kind of glad it took me so long to finally to check out the Gardens by the Bay; as I really didn't miss out on much.Consolation prize:If your a couple then maybe worth going to visit as a romantic excursion, apart from that I would actually recommend you spend your money at Sentosa which is far more worth it!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f2/eb/default-avatar-2020-27.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r420425871-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

All fake and stylised. I have to agree with the other reviewer that I had to laugh, this is not a garden, this is a garden centre. There are signs and posters promoting eco sustainability and green consciousness but I wonder if they have forgotten how much electricity is used by the many giant airconditioners to maintain the artificial temperature all year round. Perhaps that is why they need to charge an exorbitant fee of S$28!To be fair, there are structured open air lawns outside but no dogs or bicycles are allowed and I suppose if you live in a city of high rise buildings and have never experienced a real garden or seen flowers and plants growing naturally in their real environment, then perhaps a garden centre introduces you to flowers and plants you will otherwise not be able to see and allow you to take many selfies .Otherwise this is a pointless waste of time and money.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/13/47/7f/40/bayubabe.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r381740852-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

My advice would be to go for opening if possible to try and avoid the crowds.Despite many signs saying don't touch the plants or go on plant beds the amount of people pulling plants towards them to get a selfie was truly staggering. The damage was really apparent in the tulip beds. There are plenty of staff to observe, who predominantly look like bored teenagers and I did not see one of them do anything about this.The gardens advertise an audio tour which I was looking forward to, to find out a bit more. When I went to the visitor centre to pay for this I was asked for photo id.I did not have any and the staff member seamed genuinely surprised I wasn't carrying my passport around (who does?) Despite offering to leave a credit card or a large deposit I was not allowed to purchase a 4 dollar audio guide and all staff could do were quote terms and conditions at me, which is poor customer service in itself. Having travelled around the world this is the first time I have been asked for photo id. to purchase an audio guide in ANY attraction. The best part is they are advertising this audio tour at every point in both conservatories.I then tried to join a free guided tour to find out a bit more. It was a large group and a young man with a very quiet voice and no microphone was guiding the group.

Gardens by the Bay,IndahAlshahab,"Gardens by the bay during Christmas-New year, after sunset",20,30-Dec-15,"As much as everything about the gardens by the bay being beautiful during this time of the year, it was also very crowded and a terrible disarray. The place was not very well lit, presumably to maintain the natural essence of the garden. There was zero crowd control. And it seemed like everyone was trying to get down & up this one poor staircase that led to the Christmas decorations or to exit. There were people carrying strollers up/down the staircase because the elevator had a long queue. Didn't see any sign boards to show visitors alternative route in and out the area. The directory/map, if you can find them at all in this madness, was useful. We managed to find a different but longer route back to the Bayfront station. In summary, love the place but visit during a non-peak period to truly enjoy.

Gardens by the Bay,Ian G,Underwhelming,20,13-Dec-15,"As a landscape architect the Gardens by the Bay were one of my principal reasons for visiting Singapore. However I found that they reminded me of the ill-fated garden festival sites that took place in the 1980/90s in the UK: lots of 'event spaces' squeezed into an area: a sense of impermanence and no overall unity. It's more of a family theme park than an actual garden. Lots of concrete, tarmac and metal poles. The theme gardens in the main do not represent the themes stated but just have some information boards on that theme. The Cloud Dome is impressive but is essentially a hollow concrete cone covered with plants; again with its statues it's more like a theme ride (which is fine for kids). The Flower Dome was partly given over to a rather cheesy Xmas grotto. Overall fine for family day out with an element of environmental education, but not for the serious garden enthusiast who would be much better off visiting the Botanical Gardens.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/eb/43/default-avatar-2020-11.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r332339292-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,Gavin C,Truly Brilliant,20,25-Sep-15,"Gardens By The Bay is easily one of the top ""must go"" attractions in Singapore, right next to Marina Bay Sands. Most of the park is free and walking through different parts of the garden using a map is both convenient and lovely. The only entrance fees that are necessary is if you choose to go up the OCBC skyway, Cloud Forest (dome) and the Flower Dome (dome). To get the double pass for both domes, its $29SGD, although highly worth it if you don't go to Singapore regularly.At any part of the garden, it will be well maintained and work will be done everyday throughout the park.There are eateries near the main entrance there and even a Maccas, but bringing a bottle of water would be handy.Also, at the Supertree Grove, I highly recommend being there for the light show (Garden Rhapsody) that starts everyday at 7:45, 8:45 and 9:30.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/05/62/f9/98/gavin-c.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r313411059-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

How much does it take to build a real timber house ? C'mon design team, you can do better :D The quality of the displays is ""C"" grade( n I am being kind here) . There seems a mismatch in the proportions : the candy house is so big n the doll display next to it is not synchronised. The displays r so stiff they don't even warrant a pause or a picture.

Seriously, it was astounding. In order to try and get away from the narcissism we found ourselves just continually trying to find somewhere to enjoy the nature, but alas it was impossible with the crowds.

Everything was as spectacular as I had imagined. We purchased our tickets for the little electric buggy to take us around the park and to give us an overview of the whole area. We were told ""only two stops"" so when you get off here at the two pavilions you are picked up again around there. All very good but after being driven around in circles and then walking around in circles within the two towers when we came out to again catch our buggy there was no sign to say catch buggy here, just a sign pointing which way to go fromthe buggy. So we started walking in the direction of the sign only to find that there was no pick up spot as we walked and several of the buggies passed us by we waved our tickets to say we have paid but they refused to stop again saying ""only two pick up spots"". It was 35o hot & sunny, my husband and I are in our late 60s and no idea which way was out. So we spent several hours walking round and round trying to find where we should be to pick up a taxi to get back to our hotel. We were not the only ones along the route trying to get a lift, many elderly groups were also along the way. I would suggest a large sign that states ""BUGGY STOP HERE"" Then everyone would know just where they had to wait to get back on the buggy..what was going to be my most sort after event in Singapore ended up being just horrible and I ended up hot, sweaty, angry and in tears.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/d1/fc/06/fayewyer48.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r245186686-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Then, the Garden itself is big. but the array of flowers and plants are not so beautiful or interesting. To me, its more of a garden for the people of Singapore itself to see and wander around, since they're always too busy to get a holiday and visit a proper gardens in other countries. I've been to gold coast aussie, the garden and parks there is more vibrant, beautiful & attractive.

They charge SD8 for a walk up there among the big pillars in a hanging bridge. The thing is, the walk is only 5 or 10 meter long!!! and they charged you for it!!!Anyway, for me, its a big misdirection to people if they make this place a must for all tourists as I don't think its a must, unlike Orchard Road or Mustafa..but then again, its just a humble opinion.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/3d/e4/cf/imranafandy.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r191758452-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,ShazUCLA,"Not too impressed, but visited during a rainspell",20,17-Mar-13,"The walk to the Gardens By the Bay is fairly long. Going there, I went through the Marina Bay Sands and up the escalator that seemed to go through the roof. I had been walking through the Sands the night before so i knew where the elevators were. They bring you to a roof walkway that goes over the highway to the Gardens by the Bay side. At first I wasn't sure if that walkway was open or not, or if you had to pay, but going through there was no problem. You actually only have to pay for certain areas and that is when you're well over to the other side, actually IN Gardens of the Bay.It was raining the whole morning/afternoon i visited and only had about an hour or , so i decided to check out the Flower Dome, since it was enclosed. There is a long distance from the entrance to the actual domes, so make sure you do have an umbrella because you can get soaked, but the walk is actually fine. They have some trams but they didn't seem to run frequently (not sure if you have to pay), and they also sold ponchos.If you only have time to visit one dome, the price is a little cheaper and the woman at the counter didn't hassle me or anything -- but i did mention i only had time to visit one and asked how much it would be, because i think the stated price includes the two domes.Honestly, i was expecting much more from the Flower dome and was not too impressed. There was a beautiful large display area in the middle, but the other separate ""gardens"" were actually pretty small, and the entire dome itself, was actually much smaller than i imagined it would be. I had just come back from a trip to Cape Town and perhaps it was the visit to Kirstenbosch that made me unimpressed with the Flower Dome. I didn't see any proteas at the South African Garden section even though they were noted on one of the signboards (perhaps i was unlucky).On the other hand, some of the other plants and trees were very impressive and unique. I love taking pictures of flowers, so i still spent the full hour of my time there and you can get some great shots of the flowers inside the dome. From what i can recall, the info blurb content seemed more random than meaningful.I was not able to visit the skywalk or the other outside free areas due to the rain and my time restriction, but i would say the price of visiting the dome was a bit overpriced. If you are going, I would definitely prepare to be there for a few hours, to be able to enjoy the different areas.I would definitely go back on a non-rainy day to see what i missed the first time around.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/bc/16/f9/shazucla.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r154760601-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Entrances and exits are not designed well. Steps are in the wrong place. One area does not flow well to the other. Some of the design choices and positioning of items such as seating, shelter, steps seem to be an afterthought or made by inexperienced designers. Gaudy Colouring, tarmac pedestrian areas, postars are remind me of bus shelter from the 70's.It is worth going for the amazing architecture of the greenhouses and the engineering aspects of the large artificial tree project but the detailed landscape design and lack of thought lets the place down. It could have been an amazing opportunity to show quality landscape design.It is not a botanical garden as the plants are supplemented by ornamental varieties but than it is not a show garden as the planting areas do not have a 'designed' element to them.A lot of people seem to be lost or looking for shade. It will need the plants to mature to deflect from the shortcomings. Some of the major areas may need a revamp to make them workable particularly outside the eating areas and entrance/exit points.

Signage is unlit as well. So don't expect to make out what plants you are looking at. I used my iPhone flashlight as lighting to help me look at the flowers. Ridiculous.The supertrees outside the domes are beautiful at night though.

Perhaps that is why, the designers treated visitors to that depressing video presentation of our bleak future before exiting from 'Cloud Forest'.All in all, the whole place screams artificiality.

The overall layout and settings of the flowers were messy and didn't exactly bring out the beauty of each flowers. The different theme garden lacks of individualistic feel. The main good thing about the place is providing an educational lessons to the kids of the flora and fauna. The clouds dome was equally disappointing but the kids might enjoy the fake waterfalll and being like in a 'avatar' place minus the beautiful creatures. Im sure tourist from temperate countries have seen more beautiful and exotic flowers and nicer gardens than this big fake and hot garden.

We returned a few days later, thinking it would be less crowded on a week day. We were wrong. The line to buy tickets took over an hour and 30 minutes. When we approached the counter with our credit card, the girl working there did not know how the credit card machine worked. Really! She had to call someone else over to explain how to charge a credit card.Then her machine broke and we ended up paying cash.The path leading up to the ticketing line is all outdoors under a hot baking sun. You could melt just from the walk up to get your tickets. There is no shade provided at all. If you are looking for some air conditioning to get out of the sun, you can go to the Marina Bay Mall,, which is cold and free and a few minutes walk from there. We paid $56 for 2 people, and it was hardly worth it. This place may be good for people who have never traveled and have never seen unique flowers and trees. But one garden in the flower dome looked just like my garden back in upstate NY and so it was a bit disappointing for me. And given that the Botanical Gardens is free and the Orchid Garden is only $S5, i would suggest going there for a much more enjoyable and worthwhile time to be with nature.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/01/5d/01/6c/sharinyc-ny.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r133518235-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Spent 1 hr standing in line to get to the front of the line, only for them to tell us we need to go to the ticketing booth for time slot. We had tickets in our hands, why the hell would we consider going to the ticketing booth for anything??? So we went to the ticketing booth, got a time slot that is about 1 hr later, than stand in line again for another hour and 15 minutes give or take to get up to the skyway.We got to watch BOTH of the light show from the line! Despite the fact our time slot is for 8:20. But they are so unorganized that by 8:45, when the last light show started, they still have 8pm time a lot people waiting in line. I am DEAD SERIOUS!Wasted time aside, even while watching the 1st light show we thought the light show was underwhelming. The 2nd show wasn't any better.Wasted 2.5 hrs we won't get back.

Gardens by the Bay,Anstey L,Awful in the rain! Christmas Wonderland it wasn't.,10,7-Jan-20,"We were in Singapore for two days before Christmas, and having read all hype about the Christmas wonderland, we thought it would be a nice thing to take our kids to (ages 5 and 7). We pre-booked tickets for entry, the sky walk and a magic show by Vitaly.We arrived around 5, just in time for the drizzle. Singapore is not exactly rain-shy, so to be told that the OCBC sky walk was shut because of the rain was disappointing to say the least. In theory, we could have exchanged our tickets for another day, but as we were leaving the next morning, this wasn't an option for us.It turns out that Christmas wonderland is about as exciting as the inside of a paper bag in the daylight, and even less so in the rain. Great! So we headed over to the flower dome, but the queue was so ridiculous that we didn't have time to visit before the magic/illusion show was scheduled to begin.At this point, the rain was beginning to pick up. We headed back towards the theatre, at the other end of the park. As the rain became torrential, the covered walkway ended, and we had to run through puddles and rain to get to the theatre - again, rain is not uncommon in Singapore, and at other times, the sun is incredibly strong, so why not design a sheltered walkway??We bought tokens to use the miniature train, which you can take over to the theatre, but it was soooooo slow, only one of the two trains was running and it only takes 8 people in the rain. It seemed to take around 30minutes to make a round trip, so even with a short queue, it quickly became apparent that this wasn't an option.Anyway, we braved the rain and arrived at the theatre, and grabbed some seats. We watched Vitaly's promo video, which showed us his signature trick of producing a rose from what had started as a blank piece of paper. A nice trick, but why, when he came on stage, did we then get to see it twice more in his 30minute set? Even the kids were pretty underwhelmed.After the show, the rain had stopped. Having bought the non-refundable fairground tokens for the train, the kids then went on a couple of rides. They were very tame, and eye-wateringly expensive - $8 per child for a three minute go on the swings.Still soggy, we ultimately decided to skip the light show as we had heard the taxi queues afterwards can be horrendous and the kids were beginning to get hungry, so we headed back into Singapore. There is a food court at the gardens, but this was also rammed with long queues, and nowhere to sit.All in all a huge, expensive disappointment.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2a/fd/9b/avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r737483551-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

In fact, there are many houses that have more lights and decorations than this place. Our group basically started comparing which of our hometown streets have better decorations.The Skywalk has a nice view, which is really the only photo-worthy part of the entire place.

I asked if there were breakfast options at Gardens By The Bay - he said ""You'll never go hungry in Singapore.""However - we did! There were about 10 listed dining options in the brochure. We spent an hour to an hour and a half trying to located each and every one of these ""dining options"" with very unsuccessful results. Every single place at 9.30/10am was closed, all except McDonald's (which I've never been to in my life and won't start now!) and a cafe next door to it which looks like it belongs in a third world country!So we left to go and have breakfast elsewhere and never saw Gardens By The Bay, except while looking for the food options.All the staff were EXTREMELY unhelpful and gave us incorrect information and directions.

Gardens by the Bay,Agnes L,Not allowed to breastfeed,10,23-Mar-19,"Went to the Flower Dome this afternoon with my daughters and 4-month old grandson. At one point of our tour, grandson needed to be fed and we found a quiet spot in corner bench. My daughter had on her breastfeeding apron and baby was nicely tucked under it. A young service ambassador named Hani curtly told my daughter that she has to go to the toilet to breastfeed as other visitors may find it offensive. We were appalled by her words as at no time did anyone around us paid us any attention nor gave us any nasty look/remark. When I asked Hani if anyone had made any comments, she said she was just following the rules!! Well, if my daughter had been topless whilst breastfeeding, perhaps I can accept that rule. But she was definitely very covered up compared to some other scantily clad visitors walking right next to head-scarved women in the park. I don't see the service ambassador asking them to cover up!! What kind of message is Gardens by the Bay telling the public about your establishment? According to the Singapore Police Force, breastfeeding in public in Singapore is NOT an offence. I respect the laws of the country and I hope Gardens By the Bay had respected the intention of my Daughter to breastfeed my grandson in public whilst appropriately covered up.I would like to hear from the management what they have to say about this and an apology is in order, I would think.Our visit has been marred by this unpleasant encounter.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e7/fe/default-avatar-2020-58.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r660374006-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,SurayaS57,Orchid garden,10,6-Aug-18,Visited orchid garden recently at Gardens by the Bay. I know orchids can be a bit boring unless you have beautiful patterns or designs to display the orchids. Singapore flower is the Orchid however Gardens has not managed to bring out the attractive ness of the Orchids. The Tulips and roses theme in previous years were better. Just a feedback so that Gardens can make Singapore more proud in displaying your dear Orchids. Maybe you need to mix Orchids with more roses and lilies and other sweet smelling flowers too. Display was too repetitive with peranakan theme. Good luck for next year Orchid display,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/14/00/d2/03/suraya-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r603004551-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Judging from the fact the OCBC Skyway doesn't open until 9am but it had people (obviously fake tourists) doing different things, like taking wedding photos and just standing around like cows so they could film them from the drone, I assume it was for their own publicity.Checked the website but there was no mention that this main attraction for the Gardens by the Bay would be closed for filming today.

Well planned layout of the two respective Domes which we thoroughly enjoyed spending time.However there was an extra entry ticket of 10 SD per person for seeing' Light & Sound Show' on 21Dec'17 which is normally free. We were told it is due to X MAS decorations. In my view extra decorations were more of a distraction while viewing the Light and Sound Show rather than helping.

GBTB should have a quota on the no. of people allowed in the domes within a specific time so that family could wait outside and enter the domes within a timing of 1-2hrs per dome. Old people on wheelchairs should definitely be allowed first. I felt so sorry to see the officers there making very old people in wheelchairs join the 300m queue. The Cloud dome had the most horrifying queue ever! I question the safety of all people when they are up there. By the way, i go there quite often with my children and students and i have never seen GBTB so unprepared for so many people (most of them were tourists).

There is no concert, no performance, no free drinks once you get in. It is very warm inside like a trapped greenhouse in Europe in the summer. The plants are nice but very boring. Lacks charm like the Coldstream Ancestral Museum we first went to. We took photos here too but selfie opps are not as good as the Coldstream Ancestral Museum. This place is basically like a Tourist Factory. Nothing special. Very very expensive.

Gardens by the Bay,SNTas,Energy saving selfie con,10,5-Aug-17,"I went inspired by the building of this place. But its just a money making tourist trap with little interaction, except for innumerate people taking selfies of themselves rather than bothering with the flowers or beauty they have tried to create. You even get pushed through the ships st the exit. The only exit.As a environmentally aware person I was devastated by what I saw. It must have a huge carbon footprint. The cost to import the trees, the plants, the buildings the maintenance let alone the energy required would put it all into one big deficit. The plants are suffering without adequate UV light. The environmental messages are so small the selfies just walked straight by with little comprehension.

Gardens by the Bay,pekboon,Not exactly wheelchair and pram friendly at the Cloud Forest Dome,10,17-Jul-17,"In the Cloud Forest, there is only 1 lift that goes from 6th to 7th floor. It is meant for those who really need to use the lift, eg wheelchair and prams. Unfortunately, this lift is always packed with people who are fully capable of taking 1 flight of stairs but are too lazy to do so. I was pushing one of my family member in a wheelchair and my husband was pushing a pram with our son. We were unable to enter the lift. People who are fit and healthy, without any wheelchairs or prams, are jumping the queue and pushed their way into the lift. Some even took the lift from 6th floor to level one and then back up so that they can get to the 7th floor. I waited for 20mins in order to be able to enter the lift. Where are the staff? Gardens by the bay deploy 4 staffs to man the other 4 common lifts for people on get from the first floor to the 6th floor but they have no one to man the lift that brings people from the 6th floor to the 7th floor. Of course, from the 7th floor, how can we visit one floor at a time downwards? Via the same lift that was totally jammed packed of course. Poorly designed for wheelchairs and prams. 20 mins to get from 6th to 7th floor. You can do your maths on how long we took from 7th floor downwards to visit each level's attractions in the Cloud Forest Dome.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/67/avatar045.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r502697293-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

The flower dome comprises a random collection of trees and plants (and not that many flowers) that served NO educational purposes and wasn't even entertaining. I walked through it in half and hour and was left perplexed. Are we back in the Victorian age where authorities assembled random specimens for display? What was the point of this? I have no idea. The other conservatory ""the cloud forest"" was even worse. Centered around a fake waterfall, it comprises random plants and epiphytes and astoundingly has a fake ""cave"" with fake stalagmites and amethyst geodes like a bad new age store. I just laughed and walked out.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/18/0c/97/dd/nomadzenn.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r356448676-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

After that, we had to walk more than 30 minutes to the nearest bathroom, and the staff was really not helpful to find them. The lighted trees were not so impressive.

I have been several times and last year we also went to the Christmas market which we absolutely adored. It's simply astonishing! So we decided to go again this year. That was a big mistake. We couldn't even make it to the entrance. We tried to make our way through the people queuing but people came back after having queued for two hours just to get to the MRT from the market itself. Everyone was returning and saying you cannot get through, people are getting squashed so please go back. We didn't believe this and waited some more and tried to advance. When we decided it would indeed not work after another half hour (we had gained less than 1 meter) we returned home very disappointed. Again, we love GBTB and have been there several times and will go again too. The daily lightshows are a must see for every tourist and we take everyone that comes to visit us here. But the Christmas market on weekends in December... forget about that one.

Gardens by the Bay,rmv3008,Don't go to Waste your money,10,3-Sep-13,"I had been to the gardens by the Bay on the last day of my trip... Firstly, I am not a person who loves or likes plants and stuff... They charged me about 58 SGD for the 2 observatories which were completely waste for me.. Had different plants from different countries in one observatory and in other had a huge artificial waterfall which was nothing great either... The place looks stunning from outside but didnt find it great from within..",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/5f/a3/e2/facebook-avatar.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r175408562-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,Mark G,Singapore's pinnacle of plastic-ness,10,20-Jul-13,"This place is a sad reflection on modern day Singapore, where everything, including nature, can be packaged into a glass container and sold off at an extortionate price to well heeled tourists who are too fat and lazy to get themselves into a real national park or garden. It's all contrived and plastic - boring in the extreme, as any interesting insects or non-approved plant growth is removed by an army of underpaid foreign workers constantly throughout the day. The Singapore Botanic Gardens are a far more interesting place to visit.This place is also ""packaged"" as a place of sustainability - highly questionable given the huge input of concrete and air conditioning that constantly takes place here. Maybe it is sustainable when compared to a 16 lane freeway or Marina Sands shopping centre, but there is no way it is sustainable when compared to a real park or garden.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/35/f6/49/gnome54321.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r168289712-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

I am not a great admirer of over-engineered disney-land-like tourist attractions and this is definitely such a one! Don't bother to visit the completely ridiculously overpriced halls - if you want to see something more real, just go to MacRitchie or Bukit Timah nature parks...!!!A stroll in the park to see the statues is ok - if you can stand the crowds...The food court is ok.And if you want to see lite flying, just go to the most southwestern corner of the park - that s perhaps the most sympathetic part of it all...",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/57/2a/6c/coco-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r162118958-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html

Gardens by the Bay,bienebiene3,waste of money,10,15-Apr-13,what a spectacular waste of money to build this. Why would anyone pay good money and spend their time visiting man-made concrete buildings covered with plants with little or poorly written educational information? what is the point of this whole construction? or the dome next door of potted plants with no signs? avoid this place. you will be better off at the free Botanic gardens or just visiting your local nursery where at least you will know what plants you are looking at.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/f3/e4/default-avatar-2020-30.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r157710551-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,AndrewYew,Boring,10,15-Feb-13,This place is too hyped-up. If you don't know what to do with your time it is worth a visit. It is a notch better than a meaningless afternoon in the shopping mall. Otherwise if you are a real botanist you will be better off to the Botanical Gardens.This place produces so much air-con and consumes so much energy that it is amazing that it is touted as an environmental attraction.The attraction is very artificial and fake. The price is exorbitant and a free walk in the gardens outside may be more pleasant.The best thing here is that parking space is still plentiful.,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/02/1c/8f/f6/andrewyew.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r152154119-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,Pacifico W,"Concrete & steel, fake empty sadness",10,7-Feb-13,"I fought the feeling for 10 minutes after getting in, but then I gave in and WhatsApped a friend:- 'Gardens' by the Bay must be the single most fake hideous repulsive exponent of cluelessness I've ever seen in my life. -Who is this for? What is the purpose? What were they thinking? What should we be thinking? And where are the 'Gardens'? The concrete tracks with patches of plants here and there to hide the view of public elevators and toilets, leading to the central monstrosities of steel & concrete ugly columns; you call that 'gardens'? What are those things? Images from which nightmare should these monsters resemble?One of the monsters seems to house a IndoChine restaurant. Not that Singapore had a shortage of IndoChine chain restaurants, but how is it linked to a 'Garden' or a 'Bay' for that matter? IndoChine seems to call this a ""SuperTree"". Like in: superior to a tree? What is ""super"" about this slab of concrete and steel? Other than that it is super fake and super ugly? What's wrong with a REAL tree? Then again, if you don't mind paying just to get in and then be charged double for food, it's probably a much better eating option than the 'canteen' a bit further down towards the back. That is a sad and noisy lack-of-inspiration eating hall around some fast food outlets where deep-fried fat = food.Again, who is this for and what were they thinking when they started this? What should future generations be thinking? If the extraterrestrials arrive a century from now, how will they judge us seeing this insult of nature?Oh wait, now I know, of course, it's for them and that is the purpose: it's to scare the extraterrestrials away and to make sure no higher intelligence comes talk some sense into mankind.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-a/03/05/34/e2/pacifico-w.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r151577782-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,layda7,Too overpriced to see trees and plants,10,24-Dec-12,Gardens By The Bay is just a waste of time and resources. The admission fee is way overpriced to see trees and plants. It's nowhere near as good as Central Park in New York City (and Central Park is free just as it should be). Not worth visiting.

Gardens by the Bay,tiara1000,Unnatural Park,10,10-Sep-12,"Did not enjoy the visit to the Gardens by the Bay too much. Notwithstanding that huge amounts of money was spent to create the Gardens, I could not find the Singapore trademark within the Gardens. The footpaths were mostly cast in cement or cement slabs and did not get the feeling of being in a Garden. Conservatoriums were interesting and seemed like a mixed up effort of creating something different.

Gardens by the Bay,Disappointed738,A big disappointment,10,9-Aug-12,"Strongly recommend that you visit the excellent original Botanic Gardens in Singapore, rather than waste your time (and money) at the new Gardens by the Bay.Signage around the new gardens is either appalling or non-existent; cashier staff at the paydesk are abrupt and unfriendly, and the Cloud Dome is a disgraceful waste of an opportunity to have created something special and which could be memorable for the right reasons (rather than just for the concrete and confusion that reigns inside the 'building' - architect's ego allowed to run amok and created an 'experience' with no functionality and a dearth of plants).To be fair, the Flower Dome is nice and well presented, and once the main gardens mature and the signage problem is sorted, then they will be great.But in the meantime ... the existing Botanic Gardens are 10x more rewarding.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ed/7b/default-avatar-2020-6.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r136700567-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,remarkable_travels,Shocking waste of money and concrete,10,2-Aug-12,"More thought has gone into where the cafes and restaurant chain outlets go than the actual plants. It looks unfinished and the ""Supertrees"" are just metal plant holders - there are nowhere near enough real trees.I don't see how so much concrete can be eco-friendly.This cost close to $1 billion dollars, So why are we still paying to get into the conservatories and the walk on the OCBC Skyway bridge?The cost of getting into the 2 conservatories and to see the ""waterfall"" drain thing is $20 + per person.Don't bother, go to Macritchie Reservoir or the Botanical Gardens instead.I can see concrete anywhere, why would I want to see it in a garden?",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/03/93/5c/40/remarkable-travels.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2149128-r136023646-Gardens_by_the_Bay-Singapore.html
Gardens by the Bay,SL000,Poor crowd control and very slow ticketing,10,2-Jul-12,I have been standing in line for 1.5h and it's another 45 mins wait to get an annual pass. The day tickets are not any better. They have only 2 counters to cater for day admission. They finally realised that the wait is too long and set up makeshift ticket counters but did not channel the crowd there. Very poor image of the Management.
