A good experience to walk through the short but rich history of Singapore. Love the effort to include real life accounts and engaging locals to interviews for a perspective from their point of view. How people in different walks of life came through the tumultuous times of Singapore's past and most recently the Covid-19 pandemic.

National Museum of Singapore,Bon444,Very Interesting Visit,50,5-Apr-20,"We visited during the COVID-19 outbreak so I'm sure there were far fewer visitors than usual which made it a very relaxing and pleasant experience for those of us who were there. The different galleries in the museum are very well laid out and, having been to the Battlebox and learnt about Singapore during the Second World War after the surrender to Japan, we found the gallery dedicated to this period added to the experience. I think we probably visited the attractions in the correct order as we knew a lot of the facts before we saw many of the artefacts of the period that were on display..Another gallery centred on colonial times with many relevant items of clothing, photos and other reminders of the period. A must see area of the museum is The Story Of the Forest- a gently curving stair that leads from the first floor down to the ground floor illustrated with three-dimensional animations of the flora and fauna of the forest . At the time we visited, we were the only people walking down and it was an absolutely fantastic experience. We could probably have spent more time looking around if we were able to but with so much to see, choose which galleries interest you and concentrate on those if you have limited time. All the staff we came across were extremely kind, helpful and knowledgeable.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0b/21/ba/5e/bon444.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324550-r752286615-National_Museum_of_Singapore-Singapore.html

National Museum of Singapore,Naomi Philippa H,Truly Enjoyable And Informative,50,19-Mar-20,"We had the good fortune to visit during the special interactive display of Singapore's history. The tickets were incredibly reasonable although we opted to see everything. The building itself is an architectural masterpiece and we felt honoured to walk about in it.The staff are attentive and helpful but not a bit restricting or ""watchful"". The special display was amazing beyond belief...the interactive set-up made one feel like one had gone back in time and were travelling forward with the island. After spending several hours on this alone, we refreshed ourselves at the excellent in-house cafe and then proceeded to view the rest of the museum's offerings. So absorbed were we, that we forgot the passage of time and emerged after 6 hours. I could do it all over again and highly recommend a visit!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/ef/32/default-avatar-2020-12.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324550-r751389652-National_Museum_of_Singapore-Singapore.html

National Museum of Singapore,macedonboy,This museum is one of the best things to see in Singapore.,50,7-Mar-20,"This is an amazing museum all about Singapore from pre-colonial time through the eras of the colonial powers and finally to the present day. I can see the enthusiasm in which the curators lovingly put together the exhibits. The information is excellent, especially in the use of personal testimonies through audio recordings and videos.The Singapore History Gallery has some very high quality exhibits and a fantastic mock up of the quarterdeck of a ship. My personal favourite section was the Surviving Syonan which documents life and stories of the Japanese occupation. It really gives you an appreciation of how hard life was back then and just how good life is in Singapore. Another favourite is the Story of the Forest video exhibition. Children will love that one.I was only planning for 3 hours here, but ended up for 5.

National Museum of Singapore,Andrew F,Wonderful museum,50,24-Nov-19,We didn't have time to visit here on our first visit to Singapore so it was a 'must-do' for this trip. The building is impressive from the outside and no less so inside. It offers a huge area for wonderful displays and exhibitions telling the history of Singapore and its people. The Singapore History Gallery was our favourites and we also enjoyed the Modern Colony and the Story of the Forest exhibitions. There are several permanent exhibitions plus others that change throughout the year. You really do need to allow several hours to enjoy this museum fully. We did our own thing for most of our visit but we also booked one of the excellent guided tours around the Singapore History Gallery 'ì I wish that the lady guide had been my history teacher at school as she was just so enthusiastic and proud of Singapore.

The museum does a beautiful job of showing how what was happening in Singapore over 500 years tied into other parts of the globe. There were all ages on our tour and everyone was engaged. I want to also mention that I needed a wheelchair (I came on a knee scooter and wasn't allowed to take it inside). The staff provided a wheelchair and were really helpful and friendly. This was perhaps my 8-10th visit to Singapore but first to the museum. I would return happily.

National Museum of Singapore,ianwyj,Reconnecting with the history of Singapore,40,8-Dec-20,"It's been almost two decades since I visited the National Museum. I usually enjoy visiting museums but have had this (unfair) perception that this museum's displays are dull. A recent visit helped to dispel that feeling and made me see it in a brand new light. Housed in a grand mansion of a building that dates back to the 1840s, it underwent a long period of renovation before reopening in 2006. Unsurprisingly, its main exhibit is the history of Singapore. Using a variety of media, from physical mock-ups to dioramas to multimedia, visitors get to trace the island from its first historical mention in the 14th century, through its founding as a trading port by the East India Company on the early 19th century, to becoming a Straits Settlement and British colony over the next hundred or so years. The story then moves towards the Japanese occupation during the second world war, independence from Britain, and finally to its development as a sovereign nation. I especially enjoyed the displays pertaining to the development of police force as well as the effects of opium smoking. All this took me slightly over two hours to get through at a fairly lesiurely pace. I also walked through a temporary visually-stunning digital exhibition titled Story of the Forest which made clever use of the building's rotunda. And December being Children's Month at the museum, loads of kids were in attendance, mainly to have their photos taken next to the numerous Doraemon displays.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/0b/67/b1/5e/ianwyj.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324550-r778689034-National_Museum_of_Singapore-Singapore.html

In addition it is also an incredible building that melds the old colonial library with a modern building giving multiple level hillside entrances. While the modern section is very open and airy, it is the old library that is so impressive inside and out.

However, there are few old exhibits as well.Anyway, in my opinion they have done a good job with what they have.My favorite part of the museum is the exhibits and descriptions about the recent development of Singapore, starting from 1950s.

The History Gallery covers the founding of Singapore by Raffles, World War 2 and the Japanese occupation, the leadership and contributions of Lee Kuan Yew, and many other things.

There is also a multimedia show in the glass rotunda - best for small kids. The garden with local fauna is probably worth a quick look.

Much of what Lee Kuan Yew, who became Singapore's Prime Minister following the Japanese surrender, said did echoes very much Singapore's post incursion and determination to create a nation of independence.

National Museum of Singapore,ShaunH290,The Building is a Gem!,40,14-Jul-19,"We approached the museum from the rear - from Fort Canning Park - and the modern annex is huge and airy. The first display was a sinuous curve of very detailed text about the trades unions and their part in independence - I tried, but it was far too much to read. We walked over the Glass Passage connecting the two parts of the museum.The free exhibits included large rooms on the history of Singapore, including one devoted to the Japanese occupation. It is interesting reading some of the comments here by Japanese tourists. They generally do not know much about it at all. NMS has a mandate to explain the recent history of the country and it does that well.Some of the exhibits on other aspects are underwhelming. We did not, on that basis, pay for tickets to the other parts of the museum. However, the original Victorian building is a gem! We were only in Singapore for a few days, but it was worth seeing the dome from the inside first and then seeing the fa√ßade from the road last.

National Museum of Singapore,Bluesphynx,Updated history of Singapore,40,22-May-19,"As Singaporeans, we get free admission so it's a good idea to come every now and again to view the temporary exhibitions and see how the permant galleries are updated. Was very pleased to find that the history of Singapore had additional and interesting information on the surrender of Singapore, the Japanese Occupation and the separation of Singapore from Malaysia. Even more gratified to find the presentation of facts objective and non-controversial, very fair to all parties and countries involved, but details certainly giving rise to individual responses eg presentation of the Tiger of Malaya, General Yamashita, his trial and execution, the Sook Ching Massacre, Lee Kuan Yew's arguments for merger with Malaysia. There was a very good docent guiding at 11am and while not part of the group, overheard her insightful and humorous commentary which was much appreciated by the visitors.Found the temporary exhibition on 'Packaging' nostalgic, and the items, eg F n N bottles, posters well-sourced and preserved. Also enjoyed again the Enchanted Forest with the digitalized walk imaginatively put together with lovable small creatures, colorful flora and even tropical rain and melodic sounds.However, it's rather confusing finding your way around and the restrooms' signage is incredibly difficult to identify especially as the one near the entrance has been usurped by ' Food for Thought' , this food outlet looking rather uninviting with over-priced Western fare. Better to walk a bit to Food Republic across the road for delicious local fare.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e8/91/default-avatar-2020-62.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324550-r675583093-National_Museum_of_Singapore-Singapore.html

There's a good range of interactive exhibits and different things to see.The main exhibition downstairs is a little confusing to navigate at first, I was unsure which order I was meant to go round the exhibit in but once you're through to the WW2 section it's much better layed out.It's fantastically cool inside, enough so that I actually ended up being cold!

National Museum of Singapore,Stephen U,Not as interesting as it could have been,30,15-Dec-19,"This, to my mind, was how not to run a museum; (though how too many museums are run these days.) There was far too much emphasis on 'interaction'ù and staging and not enough illumination and education for my (admittedly olf fashioned,) taste. There were a lot of very good exhibits, and obviously a lot of very good intentions, but somehow it did not come together: too much staginess in some areas. The Singapore History exhibition relied too much on dodgy sets and animations. What was that walk down the spiral through the forest all about? Poor quality CGI that, if it was telling a story, rather kept is hand well shielded. Do animals mince? I don't think our negative reaction was just because we are old grumps: it did not seem to grab the attention of the kids either.There was just too much trying hard. Does the tragedy of the Syonan-to period really need a soundtrack of Japanese dive bombers and exploding bombs to get it across, or does that actually detract from the message? Elsewhere, I am afraid I would have had the temerity to question the description of one or two items.

There are four or six galleries that break down history into 10 year periods which are quick to see if you don't want to spend all day in a museum. And well done as well. Also, right now - Feb 2018 - there is an excellent exhibit about the Japanese occupation of 1942. Best part are the oral histories of actual survivors. You stand in a circular space listening to their first hand account and watch pencil and ink sketches depicting the events as they tell it.

It touched on the key stages in the history of Singapore, but there was no depth, no discussion and no tension. In fact, I had trouble working out a story as I moved from room to room, just artifacts and portraits and points in time. Suddenly brittish appear, suddenly there's a malaysian independence, then suddenly, there's independent singapore. Singapore is such a melting pot, it would have been good to see the Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist cultures learning to live together (with both ups and downs), the struggle with Colonial powers, and the wider Malaysia and the trials of becoming a modern city.

I would have liked more of a time-line to guide us through the history of Singapore. Maybe, I would have got more out of it if we'd been in time for the guided tour.

There are five galleries in the main building (four upstairs and one downstairs) which cover different periods of Singapore's history. Start upstairs to go in chronological order.

National Museum of Singapore,A R H,National Childrens' Museum?,30,11-Aug-17,"This can not be titled a National Museum with these exhibits - very disappointing and vary un-Singaporean! The various time period rooms were just a collection of posters skimming over events, with the WWII time frame totally distorted and uninformative. The ground floor history gallery was a bit better, but a total maze of rooms that had me going round in circles and I'm sure I missed things as a result. Singapore has a large amount of museums covering all sorts of subjects and periods, but visitors tend to head to the National Museum first because of the name, so why not make it a truly National Museum rather than a superficial look at the country.

Of more interest was the Singapore History Gallery on level one, but I found the layout of that gallery very confusing. The Flutes restaurant displayed a menu of impressive, but expensive Western dishes. Definitely not a must see, but located near Bras Basah and Dhoby Ghaut MRT stations if you go.

National Museum of Singapore,geographyguy_11,Good as an introduction,30,22-Mar-17,"The National Museum of Singapore offers a comprehensive overview of Singapore's history from the establishment of the very first fishing village by a passing King to the post-independence development and industrialization. However, unless you visit this as soon as possible during your Singapore holiday, you will find it a tad boring. I didn't get here till me last day and having already been to the Former Ford Factory, Battle Box, Changi Museum, Singapore City Gallery, Arts House at Old Parliament, Chinatown Heritage Centre, Peranakan Museum and many others, I found that the National Museum was repeating what I had already seen. The smaller Life in Singapore Galleries on the 2nd floor did not add much to the main (and extremely well-presented) Singapore History Gallery on the ground floor. The Glass Rotunda displays a Disney-style little kids magic forest with zero connection to Singapore.

She pointed to the spot where I was to meet the guide. As I had an hour to wait, I went and had a fish and chips lunch (S$16.00 ++) at the Terrace Caf√©. Unfortunately the fish, covered in thick batter, was almost inedible because the fillets under the batter were dark and slimy.At 12.50 p.m. I returned to the place which had been pointed out to me but when no-one else had turned up by 1.20 p.m. I left and explored the exhibits by myself.I agree with the previous reviewer who said that the exhibit which explains the history of Singapore is like a maze. I found it disjointed with no clear indication of the pathway to follow in order to view the displays.

It was certainly interesting and good to learn how Singapore came to be what it is today.

This one does not, I understand that Singapore is a young country but vast space is thinly furnished with exhibits from WWII and poorly edited shows about the great kampong fire, I understand that this is an important event but the details are explored exhaustively.The building itself is wonderfully restored, all credit for this amazing job which marries the old a new in a world class example of how to restore and modernise an old space.

While the building itself was beautiful we did feel that the majority of the exhibits on show when we visited were more aimed at adults (or at least teenagers). The sections on Singapore's history and cultures etc were well presented and informative with lots of reading and visual displays to enjoy. We just wish we didn't have two primary school age kids trying to hurry us along! On a positive we had a lovely lunch at the relaxed cafe on sites (especially the beef salad).

The museum is very well presented and provides a run down of the Malay Peninsular right through to independence for the Singapore state. There is very limited number of original artefacts to complement the displays - however there are numerous replicas and all is laid out in a very imaginative way. I spent around 2 hours here including a visit to the cafe. There are additional special exhibits which would take longer.

National Museum of Singapore,ZacMonaco,Inaccurate account of Japanese occupation,20,20-May-18,"I was very disappointed in the exhibition covering the history of Singapore - in particular the section covering the Japanese occupation during WWII.The exhibition gives the impression that life under Japanese rule wasn't too bad as long as you followed the rules and got the right permits. There is no mention of Sook Ching which was the systematic killing of members of the Chinese population. Officially Japan claims that fewer than 5,000 deaths occurred, while Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first prime minister, said ""verifiable numbers would be about 70,000"". In 1966 Japan agreed to pay S$50 million in compensation, half of which was a grant and the rest as a loan. They did not make an official apology.I do not understand how this could not be mentioned in the exhibition or is it that the museum authorities do not wish to offend anyone.

National Museum of Singapore,Taylablake,Boring and basic,20,13-Apr-17,We usually love museums. But this was boring and basic! Firstly you line up to buy a ticket but you can not see the prices until you get to the desk. This wastes people time as no one is prepared. They layout is not great. You enter the first level and follow that floor plan around then you go upstairs to the second level only to end up back on the first floor in the first exhibition you started with and then you have to re exit that one and go back upstairs to continue. If you knew about this you would start right at the top and work your way down.Personally we learnt and appreciated more of Singapore history at our tourist attractions.What was great was the architecture of the building. Stunning! That gets 10/10!The cafe there was ridiculous. We waiting for 15 minutes at our table and got ignored so we decided to get up and order. Only to be told we had to sit down for our order to be taken. So we sat down for a further 15 minutes. Didn't get served so we left.If you had children you will be very sorry you take them here!

The only thing that caught my eye was the Lewis ivory chess pieces and they only had TWO!If this is your first museum visit, you may enjoy it, but if you've been to any museum at all, then this exhibit is profoundly disappointing.The curator also didn't seem to have an overarching theme or idea outside of showcasing different parts of the world.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/1a/f6/e5/2b/default-avatar-2020-52.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324550-r352238729-National_Museum_of_Singapore-Singapore.html

The building was huge, but empty! There was vast open spaces of nothing! Disappointed we went into the main exhibition and were given head phones and an electronic device. The exhibition was disjointed and often hard to follow and offered no written explanation for the item you were looking at. The audio was usually a voice pretending to be someone who would have used the item, but it often left you none the wiser as to what the item is or the history of it. The audio for each item/area was often long winded and hard to stay focused. We left with no real understanding of the history of Singapore. Simple written information was needed, and the audio should have been used to enhance the information, not the only information source.

As if they were asking the Japanese embassy for approval?!The fashion exhibit allocated space and created highlights that indicated the museum was proud about the dominance of Western fashion over traditional clothing after World War II.A far more interesting development a decade later in fashion -- the government's policies to force men to keep short hair and avoid hippie fashion -- were minimized in a corner but at least they were displayed.Overall, this museum is more about national pride and collective identity, not so much about history.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/07/01/25/db/lightluggage2.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324550-r200304758-National_Museum_of_Singapore-Singapore.html
National Museum of Singapore,Michael-Barry,What a Waste of Space,10,11-Jun-13,"Most of the exhibition rooms were closed, the Singapore History Gallery is poorly lit and without a guide or tablet little sense can be made of the items viewed, we found it impossible to get any ""feel"" for the Gallery, when coming down the ramp ....around and around with nothing to see, the link from the video start to the gallery is lost.Strange place ?",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/01/2e/70/97/avatar023.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324550-r163627734-National_Museum_of_Singapore-Singapore.html
National Museum of Singapore,Paul S,Too High Tech,10,14-May-13,"This museum is a great place. I encountered the officiousness that seems too persavive amonst the new immigrants to Singapore. I wasn't allowed to move through until the lady handing out the interactive handsets had finished with her group. The guy just monstered over me as iff I was going to walk through anyway, probably because others have because of the silliness of this rule.That aside the interactive hand set was a bit of a joke. Why they needed to reinvent the way a museum works I don't know because the handset was just foollishness gone mad.The museum was great and looked very interesting but the laziness of not putting signs up explaining the exhibits spoilt it all.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-l/06/7a/57/9c/paul-s.jpg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d324550-r160633722-National_Museum_of_Singapore-Singapore.html
