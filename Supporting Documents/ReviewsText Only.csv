"It is a unique architectural form stands out as an icon within the equally striking Marina Bay Sands which is one of the two integrated resorts in Singapore. While the other focuses on fun, MBS focus on exhibitions and conventions.The exterior form while viewed from far is liken the splashing of water and has relevance to the ship like form of the hotel behind. When you draw near, you will noticed that the building is supported mainly by concrete (I think) stilts, given a sense of impossible support. To maintain this openness feel, the entrance to the museum is encased in glass and it's so well done that i have never noticed it the last 5 or so years I have been passing in front of it, unless I have a reason to look for it today.Beyond the entrance lies a cafeteria which is well positioned to serve as a waiting area for visitors to the museum. The exhibition halls are located above and below this level and is reached by lifts and stairs (I think).At the basement, the middle opens into a courtyard space looking up into sky. This is a great way of bringing nature and natural light into an otherwise dark basement.Future World - an exhibition centers around interactive images and light shows is happening now. The show is interesting as one could interact with the wall projection by touching it. Some of the exhibits even allow you to draw relevant images and upload it into the projection using a scanner.The last exhibit is a light show which makes use of floor and wall mirrors to give the impression of endless rows of light.An exhibition not to be missed. In my opinion."
"Went to see 'Futureworld: Where Art Meets Science'. Our kids (7,9) complained before that we insisted about going to a museum, but they LOVED every part of the exhibition. It was super interactive and kids friendly - and interesting for adults as well. The building is great in itself and well worth a visit."
"Always wanted to visit their exhibit! Their digital art is stunning and really photogenic. We liked the section where we paint marine animals or city buildings and get it scanned to appear on the screen! Even for an adult, it was fun to do. Also visited Plastic or Planet exhibit by National Geography."
I love that place since Im a big art fan! And i like to take a good looking pictures! I always will recommend this place to my friends!Dont forget to check it out the indoor place at marina bay sands. Somehow most of my friends didnt do it!You have a huge discount if you are staying in Singapore so ask one of your local friends!enjoy!
"We visited two exhibitions here - Disney and Future World. We found the Disney exhibition a little disappointing, it wasn't interactive at all and a little dull, even for my disney-loving 8 year old! However Future World made up for it, we spent hours there viewing and interacting with the displays. It was loved by both kids and adults. We also discovered that kids get free entry on a Friday, something not overly promoted but worth remembering."
"Amazing Museum! The place overall architectural design is great.The exhibit is a great chance to expose yourself to current technologies. You can interact with the various shows inside the room. Inside Future World is relatively dark so if you want to snap pictures, make sure that your camera are capable of capturing great photos in low light mode."
went here with a group of my friends and we just loved it!! took lots of pics that were so insta-worthy and the technology just amazed us all. so many things we did! there was this interactive wall where we could choose our animals and color and decorate it then it will pop up on the big screen. that one was really fun and nice to see our drawings on the big screen. we had so much fun and would definitely come back here again! ;-)
"If you're a curious person and a futurist, this is the museum for you! they have interesting seasonal exhbitions such as future world and Wind Walkers: Theo Jansen's Strandbeest. I occasionally check their site to see what they have. they also have bundles where you go for 2 exhibitions or more and get it cheaper.great view by the bay as well."
"This is the second time visiting Singapore, and second time at the museum. Maybe I've just been lucky, but both times we saw fantastic exhibits. I love it here and would definitely suggest a visit."
A new age interactive museum that juxtaposes art and science. There are several large rooms and exhibits with a lot of emphasis on light and touch. Spend a couple of hours here.I was also fortunate enough to witness the Walt Disney exhibit which showed the evolution of walt disney cartoons and movies through the years with some authentic artwork.
"This Musium is one of the best pieces of entertainment I have found in Singaopre. There is something for all ages from moving digital wall desplays through to interactive play areas for the young and old, A truly fascinating hands on place to visit."
"Good interactive experience with science and technology. Buy a ticket online in advance to maybe avoid queuing and have a better price. Interactivity is wonderful and fun for kids. However there are a lot of angles to take art pictures for Instagram or Facebook for adults, so do not visit alone. Should visit their official site first and research about exhibitions."
Spent several hours here with 2 teenage daughters. All had a fantastic time the interactivity of the displays is wonderful. Highly recommend this attraction. Allow around 3 hours.Short walk to the gardens to round out a full day
"Don't miss to visit The Art Science Museum at Marina Bay Sands. You will find how Singapore will looks like in 2221 , their housing , their transport system , their food and agriculture and many more .Let your kids to be witness of such mega knowledge hub there and feed kids with advance knowledge . Just amazing arrangmemt in every corner ."
Fantastic place to visit for kids and adults. Current exhibit is future world. It merges art and computer science into a digital art work. The displays are innovative and interactive. The highlight for me was the space light room. My kids loved creating art then having it come to life on a digital world computer screen.
"My husband and I visited here and we both really enjoyed it even though we are both adults! Very interactive and very cool! Thank you for a great time there. My only thought on how the museum could improve is I wish staff were more attentive on childrens' behavior and enforcing rules. As an educator I do understand kids will be kids; however, a lot of what I witnessed is parents on cell phones while their children are running aroun disturbing other guests."
"Great experience! We were three adults 23-61 years old, and we were all impressed by the clear mission of the museum (to combine art and science), the importance of their exhibitions, the interactive entertainment, and the cafe. Everything was good about it."
Worth to visit if you are in singapore! Managed to visit Future World and is fantastic! Love all of the fantasy lighting inside. Kids friendly zone
Went with our teenage daughter who loves history and got the full access pass. There were 3 exhibits on and each was very different. The curators for these exhibitions do an amazing job and the staff are helpful and knowledgeable.
"The interactive light exhibition at the Art & Science exhibition museum, is amazing. Focussed on children, this is a visual experience for all to see. It is simply amazing and make sure you find the time to see it."
"We were recently in Singapore and attended the Disney Animation exhibit that they had on, we absolutely loved it each area was dedicated to a certain movie and it mainly went in chronological order, there were certain areas that were interactive for photos which was great. The information of each was informative and seeing the sketches with notes was great. Highly recommend seeing while it is there! Only downside was the prices in the gift shop they are more expensive than actually at Disneyland in the USA"
Challenging and interesting. Great location. Museum shop not hot in terms of merchandise so don't plan on buying gifts for people back home.
I visited during the Disney exhibition and the digital labs exhibit. I highly recommend both. Digital labs for its interactiveness and pure fun and the Disney one for its childhood nostalgia. Its amazing what the Disney studio was able to produce using its own innovative techniques before technology became what it is today.
"Worth your time visiting where Art meet Science, good exhibits shown with helpful and knowledgeble staff. We spent few hours here before enjoy shopping at Mrina Bay Ssands shopping Center where is in walking distance from ArtScience Museum."
best place to see exhibition. great staff very helpful. usually held 2 or 3 exhibition at the same time. you can buy 1 ticket for 1 exhibition or bundled 1 ticket for 2 exhibition for a cheaper price. great ambience
"On our recent visit we took in the Disney Animation display. There were two on at the time and the very helpful service person at the ticket office suggested this would be more suitable for us as the other was mainly for children.Essentially it was the story of Disney from the late 1920's through to the present with a lot of examples of the original drawings that resulted in the animated presentations.Walt Disney's impact on the creation of the 7 dwarfs was quite a surprise, particularly with regards their individual voices and personalities."
Absolutely loved visiting the art science museum. Everything was so fun and interactive and very different from everywhere else we visited. I'd definitely recommend this place if you have time and it's very close to gardens by the bay and other attractions so can be added to the itinerary easily.
"Came here for my second time with my girlfriend and a couple of friends, we went visit the future world, and it's absolutely amazing. The ticket is 19$ per person but you can spend hours inside and won't get bored! A good place also for children!"
"Unusual Museum with interactive exhibitions for both adults and children. There were three exhibitions when I visited the place: - Wonderland, Disney (Magic of Animations) and Future World. A discount applies if one buy two or more exhibitions tickets at the same time. Great place rain or shine. There is a small restaurant at the entrance on first floor for tired legs. Worth a trip and explore this iconic museum.The museum is well placed near the Marina Bay, 5 - 10 minutes walk from the Bayfront MRT."
"The future world exhibition was brilliant . Wall projections of gardens , butterfly's , patterns . Interactive wall where you touched shapes and they turned in to animals running across the wall , wonderful . Upstairs was an exhibition of inflatables , rabbits , the moon and others . Spent a happy few hours , great fun ."
"This is a good place for children to play and have fun.There are several interactive exhibits which merge science and art for children to have fun and play.In particular the kids might enjoy the tunnel, and the slide.If you have kids who are older and can draw you might want to spend extra time for them to draw and colour."
The exhibitions here are quite different to anything you will see at another museum. We enjoyed Future World on our visit. Looks like the exhibitions change every few months so a good place to come back to if your a regular visitor to Singapore.
This museum is world standard. We paid for a ticket that allowed us to see every exhibition which was well worth it. There were three separate exhibitions on and we visited on a day when children were free. This is perhaps not a good idea as it was extremely busy. The exhibitions are world class and one was from ACMI in Melbourne. It is worth visiting this place just to see the extraordinary buidling.
"This exhibition was recommended by a family member as being unusual and fascinating and it certainly was. It was a definite advantage if you knew the ""Alice in Wonderland"" book. The exhibition followed the theme of the book - unusual doorways, lots of items with which to interact, colours, twists and turns, book characters appearing, and joining in with the croquet match yourself. A special feature was The Mad Hatter's Tea Party - imaginatively staged and totally quirky. This was an unusual exhibition that brought to life Lewis Carroll's ""Alice""."
"The Future World exhibition is one of the best interactive exhibits for kids I've ever seen. 1-2 hours depending on how long you want to spend going through each part. Wonderland takes about 30 minutes, unless you're a hardcore Alice fan, then maybe 1 hour."
"This one of place you've to visit in Singapore if you are art-loving! Combine art with ""modern technology"" to give you the best experiences!"
"I would like to commend Marilia for the fantastic tour that she gave on the Alice in the Wonderland Exhibit. She was really enthusiastic and friendly throughout the tour. She provided alot of insights to the exhibit, bringing the experience to another level. I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much if she was not there."
"The exhibitions change every few months, even as a local I am interested to check them out from time to time. They have free movie screenings and the area is very comfortable to just chill and enjoy the movie."
"The Art Museum is at the bay front area near the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. You can receive a discount for the tickets if you show your Marina Sands Club card. You must enter the elevator and go down to the basement to purchase tickets. Although there were 3 exhibits, we chose the Future World exhibit. I was more impressed than a child. The exhibits are soothing, and interactive. Our favorite part involved coloring on pre-printed sea animal pictures, then you place in the scanner and instantly they come to life on the wall. It's a lot of fun to see the turtle swimming, the jellyfish moving, sailfish swishing around...etc. It's new technology that I had not experienced. The same repeats in another room but with a city scene. Visitors can color cars, trucks, planes, and space ships.A separate wall has Oriental characters that once touched turn magically into animated animals on the wall.There are plenty of other activities for kids, all hands on interactive.On the weekends, when it's more crowded, there may controlled entrance times, so ask at the ticket counter.Overall, impressive and surprised by this fun museum."
"We visited the Art Science museum for three exhibitions; Floatopia, Future meets Science, Alice in Wonderland.Alice in Wonderland, the experience was very well explained on entry and we had different maps to look around and explore. There was a lot about the background on Lewis Carroll and how Alice had came to life over the years in different countries. There were good opportunities for photos and lots on for young and old alike.Future meets Science - the exhibition gets the public involved with digital integration. However it is fairly crazy in parts with people standing and not moving or moving slowly on walls. Everyone eventually gets a turn at the main areas. The lights are very pretty and can leave you in awe.Floatopia - this has been put on the top floor and it's a blimp full of joy with giant inflations taking up space and you'd want to run up and cuddle it but you will be asked to step back from the artwork to a marked point for photos."
"i was here for my birthday. i enjoyed this with my girl friend. she felt so happy in future world. there are many tourists. there is also many games for kids they can play with colours in touch screens, play with balls and can dance. there is also a coffe shop you can relax and eat something. we bought our tickets online."
"The best experience in our visit to Singapur. We enjoyed a lot with the surprising experiences inside. We took off our shoes, and had fun ... also with the scape room of Alice in Wonderland! you will not regret the visit. To take out tickets was easier than expected as there were machines and an assistant to help you with them."
I visited recently with my four and a half year old grandson and had an amazing time at one of the interactive Exhibitions .I actually had to drag him out after four hours for refreshments otherwise we would have stayed a couple more hours I'm sure.The whole place is staffed very well with friendly helpful crew.There is a Cafe at ground level with light refreshments and drinks which was nice.There was also a safe place to leave his scooter which served a great purpose.We can't wait to go back again.
Went to the Future World Exhibition and it was so incredibly amazing and worth going to. We visited the 3 exhibitions and they were all incredible.
"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit, with three adults and a young child. The current exhibitions are wonderful and it easily occupied a few hours of our time. The museum is well laid out with plenty of space to enjoy and interact with the exhibits. Staff were helpful in explaining various aspects."
Decided to visit on a whim while in Singapore. Had a couple of hours before a flight and wanted some cool air con. Was pleasantly surprised how well this place is put together. The exhibits were fantastically entertaining and easy to access. Ordering tix was also a breeze at the self-service stand.
"I can only speak about the Future World exhibit, but it was ridiculously cool. There were about ten rooms, and while many of them are mostly catered to children, the intersection of art and technology is still very interesting. The final room cannot be missed - it is one of the coolest things I've experienced."
"We spent our last day in Singapore at the ArtScience Museum, and we all loved it. We live in Japan, so we are very familiar with TeamLab exhibits, and my kids were thrilled to get the chance to visit a different one. The interactive activities were fun for all of us. They especially loved coloring their pictures and seeing them come to life up on the wall. Aside from a few extra activities, this one was very similar to TeamLab Future Park in Fukuoka.The Wonderland Exhibit was our favorite. It was so cool how the maps interacted with some displays, and we all enjoyed hunting for our maps story in each room."
"Kids had an amazing time in both the FoW and Wonderland exhibitions. The line to get into the exhibitions are somewhat long, but well worth the wait for the fantastic experience inside. Both exhibitions are interactive and engaging. I can especially envision spending half a day at FoW alone (with kids) if we have had more time.Would suggest child/ senior friendly arrangements to enhance the experiences of those two groups with special needs. I see a lot of family waiting in line, and kids gets restless after a long wait. Some fall asleep in their parents arms while waiting and had to be carried for hours."
"We went to the Art and Science Museum, expecting to see the 'Alice' exhibit, but were told that there was a 30 min wait. They then suggested Future World, which was amazing!! It was really interactive with slides, glowing balls, design your own hopscotch... I can't even begin!! A bit crowded and expensive but TOTALLY worth it!!!!!!"
"First of all in my opinion, an extent of which you would value the show very much depend on what shows are being staged. Luckily, beside The Future World, we also had Alice in Wonderland, during our July visit. The museum has different agenda over time.My kids claimed that the show has been their highlight during Spore holiday in July 2019.The colors show, 3D paintings, are mind-boggling. While Alice in Wonderland exhibition took us back in the time of magical journey. Overall, we appreciate governmsnt of Singapore on their endeavor to provide affordable yet entertaining and educative show to the public."
"Tickets are easily purchased online.I only had time for one exhibit and decided on the Future World ... When Art meets Science.The high tech interactive exhibits were awesome! If you love taking photos, my advice is to go on a weekday when its less crowded. Highly recommend!"
"We had seen this on a YouTube video. Upon arrival we found there were different areas to visit and each had to have their own ticket purchased. We went through the art science part. It's one of those museums which will create memories which will never be forgotten. Seeing so many people from all ages, all nationalities and religions, just smiling and having fun, interacting with technology, creating art, sounds and games was magical. If you have teens, smaller children or no kids. Just go, and interact, you'll love it."
"The current exhibitions are amazing. Floating Utopias and Wonderland exceeded my expectations. Future world was pretty cool. The lady at the information desk gave a great tip, if we joined the Sands Rewards Lifestyle program we could buy 1 ticket and get a second one free, so instead of paying $40 each per adult for all of the exhibits, we paid only $20 per adult."
I bought e ticket for all access..My family including 5 yo boy enjoyed every attractions.Really amazing way to combine art and science.A bit confused to get there when using bus..but not a big issue..You just need consider walking distance if you need to walk with small kids
this place is good for kids and many stuff there really nice ambient. you can take a picture but not with flash.
"Not to be missed, an amazing experience . We went to the Future World exhibition only, however there are others. It was wondrous, viewers can interact with the projected images. You could also draw & colour in pictures, scan them in and they then would be generated on the wall, becoming part of the projected art. Great for all ages, our 6 year old son had a ball and thought that it was amazing."
The mix of art and science was really cool. Wish we'd had more time here. Lots of the exhibits are interactive.
Went to this museum in 2018 and my order and I loved it. This year he was 3.5 years and loved it even more.The Wonderland exhibit was over his head but the main interactive digital one was superb. The VR forest experience was good too.
"One of the best places to visit in Singapore, especially if you are with young kids, but also for adults with a sense of fun too.We actually bought our tickets through Klook but realized our mistake after we saw a sign saying that on that particular day children could enter free of charge. But we did take advantage of this by buying adult tickets at the ticket office for Wonderland and the children got in free.We started with Future World which my kids went craxy about. My wife and I also had terrific fun. We coloured in pictures of cars, rocket ships, buses and trucks and then scanned them into a machine and the next moment our drawings were floating across a huge screen on roads. We must have spent about half an hour playing around here.There are several activities like this, another with butterflies where you can touch them on the screen and they fall down. And another where you colour in things and they are displayed moving across the screen. I have to say this again, that my young children had an absolutely brilliant time. I believe there were about six or seven activities here and they were all fun.The second attraction here was Wonderland with an Alice in Wonderland theme. This could involve adults more than the previous attraction and was enormous fun. It included exploring different areas and looking for clues and doing several other activities. The one we enjoyed the most was having a photo taken of our faces and then seeing ourselves as a playing card with arms and legs and our silly faces bouncing around across a large screen.So as a place to bring young children I would say definitely visit the ArtScience Museum. For young couples or couples with a good sense of fun then you will also have fun here too. The visit was really worth it and was one of the highlights of our trip."
"It's a good attraction for children, for teens not so much except for the photo spots that are so cool and instagram worthy."
"It's not Art and Science. It's not even Art/Science. It's ArtScience, because the two disciplines are seen as one, and the whole museum is dedicated to proving that theme. A feast for the eye, the mind and the soul, for adults and for children. Just jaw dropping. And it was an extra bonus that they were having a special exhibit regarding Richard Feynman, who went to the same high school I did!"
"Trying to describe how amazing some of the exhibits are would be nearly impossible; the technology involved is incredible. You just have to visit!We had two people with us who were initially very vocal about the fact they didn't like 'museums' and were sceptical of what this would be about. They loved it!The 'Future World' exhibits were all about people interacting with art and science. For example, you could colour in or draw a house, plane, car on a regular piece of paper and then quickly scan it and watch it be added to a giant, animated virtual city, alongside everyone else's creations.There was a dark room with a virtual waterfall where the presence of people in the room disrupted the flow of water just like it would in nature.Basically, I highly recommend it and you should check it out for yourself! Allow about 90-120mins depending on whether you have small children, as there's plenty for them and they could want to stay a while!Overall I'd give it 71 out of 77."
"So, unfortunately, I didn't take a lot of photos but did take a lot of videos which I can't post on here. The FutureWorld exhibit was absolutely amazing. It was an interactive exhibit! So cool. The first room was a bunch of flowers and butterflies on all of the walls of the room (and the ceiling and floor), then the rain started and so did the amazement. The water would move around your feet, then when you moved, flowers would sprout up. It was so cool!The next room was the FUN room. There were so many things to do in this room and it was great for kids of all ages. The first thing was a slide with projected objects on it, when you touched them stuff would happen (the cherries would explode and ricochet off other objects). The next part was a table with wooden objects (mountains, water, trains, homes) that when placed on the table would create that object on the table. If you placed 2 of the water objects, it would create a river and if you put the train markers across from each other over the water, it would create a bridge and the train would travel between the two markers.Next up were drawing stations that you could color a pre-drawn picture then scan into the system so it would be projected onto the wall. There was a Hop Scotch course that was generated by 3 different computers and you actually jump down it. There was so much to do in this room, I couldn't take it all in.The Minimalism exhibit was very interesting, but we really should have done that first. It was so much more subdued and thought-provoking that it was a big change after the Future World exhibit.Overall, this was such a great museum, it was almost surprising that it was associated with the Marina Bay Sands hotel."
"Awesome family (teenagers) activity. We saw this advertised on Instagram. We purchased tickets at the last minute on-line; it seemed this was necessary as the other exhibition was sold out on the day we visited. Registration was a bit painful due to all the details asked.We only visited the Future World exhibition so can't comment on the other one. There was plenty for adults and kids to take in and do, including drawing, then having it scanned to appear on a large screen! The 178,200 LED light display was amazing.Highly recommended."
This exhibition was amazing... I was in my element being a HUGE Alice in Wonderland Fan I could t have been happier.In terms of an exhibition building the art science museum is modern and clean and well airconditioned
We visited the 'Wonderland' exhibit and it was brilliant. Very well executed and fully immersive. Happily surprised and not excessively priced. Took about 90 minutes without rushing.
"We got tickets for both the Future World exhibition and the Minimalism. With young kids, I felt that we should have missed Minimalism as it has beyond their comprehension (and mine too, in all honesty). The Future World exhibition is a permanent fixture and great fun for both kids and adults. I recommend you check whether they have ticket promotions for marina bay sands memberships - they usually do. I didn't do this and missed out on their 1-for-1 tickets! The membership can be signed up for online before you go so it really is quite easy to get one."
"They have different exhibits on each time of the year, that come from all over the world. The exhibits that I went were amazing. I saw a marvel exhibit in the museum."
"The ArtScience Museum was a really fun surprise and a worthwhile visit. I wasn't expecting too much, but we really enjoyed our 2-3 hours here. The FutureWorld exhibit is more oriented to those with younger kids, but is still very enjoyable for adults and teens. Participating in each of the exhibits makes a big difference. If you skip over a couple you may feel that you are done before you even begin. However if you participate in each (eg making drawings that come alive on the 3D screens) it truly enhances the visit. I would definitely return."
"We went here several times but never with children. So when we went there with our 2 and 4 yo it was a blessing that the exhibitio. of PlayLab is for children mainly. They loved it and came back again at the same day. I won't recommend this place for family with young children if there was no children friendly exhibition. My children have gone to many museums before. They went to museums or exhibutions in Paris, Barcelona, Rome, Amsterdam, small ones in Venice, Vicenza, Kobe etc you get the point and they were in awe with everything but my 4 yo said she didn't like the museum upstair except for the clock. Will try National Gallery next. But... I like this small museum a lot. Don't know what will improve their ratings among families with really young kids. They are kids anyway but their opinion matters for their parents."
"Specially for children. My husband and I enjoye it very much and took many fun pictures. We also went to the Minimalism exhibit at the 3rd floor, very cool!"
"When u see an art, it's not about the artwork itself but how u feel about it. Some people might say it's interesting, some people might say it's boring, well I'd say we loved it!My husband and I went there with a group of friends. It was a very hot & humid day in Singapore, so to go to this place was a perfect choice because it is indoor & fully air-conditioned.It is children friendly too. There's an area specially designed for children, or even adults, as long as ur child is not afraid of darkness."
"It's not a typical kind of museum wherein you can find a portrait or history of a certain place, this museum is more on a futuristic one!. All ages(even kid at Heart)can visit ArtScience museum and for sure you will amaze and enjoy it!.When me and my sister visited the museum, we purchased first the ticket online coz we don't want to fall in line and wait for a long queue. The ticket cost around $26.95 (99 aed) per person (we bought it on Klook). The museum Opens daily from 10:00am-7:00pm, and their Last admission is 6:00pm. Either you can take MRT or Bus to be able to visit this place.For MRT : 10 minute walk from Bayfront Station (CE1/DT16) or 15 minute walk from Promenade Station (CC4/DT15)For Bus : 97 or 97E and get off at the bus stop of marina bay sand hotel at bayfront and from there you can walk going to the museum.Me and my sister really enjoyed it and felt like we are in the other world."
"The Marina Bay Sands is one of the top destinations in Singapore and the ArtScience Museum plays a large role in that. The first thing you will notice is the incredible architecture, not only of the the museum but of the surrounding outdoor space and shopping mall. Inside the TeamLab exhibit is a world unto itself. I was told when I bought the ticket that it was designed for children, but when I went aside I think the adults were more enchanted than the children. It is digitally stunning and very interactive. Everyone seemed to have a great time engaging with the exhibits. I only wish I had more time to explore thoroughly the rest of the museum"
I went to 2 exhibitions.The TeamLab exhibition is so famous worldwide and it didn't disappoint me. The setting was so pretty and I love the interaction between visitors and different projections.I enjoyed the Minimalism exhibition too as the art pieces show what 'less is more' means. The museum is very big and gives you a lot of space to see the art pieces in different angles and think.Staff there were helpful and nice. Recommended!
"We love ArtScience Museum, especially the Future World Exhibition. We have been here countless times. It's just such a great place for young children to play, to draw, to be surprised, easily to spend 1-2 hours here in an afternoon. Future World Exhibition is interactive, is fun, children love it. Museum made effort to update the content from time to time to keep it more attractive to regular visitors like us."
"We visited only the future world exhibit in ArtScience museum..it is worth it..the exhibits are breath taking..The first one is interactive and you can see the butterflies fall down when you touch them. My little one was running around touching them.. They have a set of fun activities for children which is equally fun for adults as well..see you drawings come to life ..I read in a review that the led balls make sounds but the place was so noisy that we didn't hear anything.. the last installation is just breathtaking..led lights display accompanied by music. When you walk through them you enter a different realm. Best part, you get to choose the pattern from a touch screen kept in the viewing area. I loved the wave pattern which puts life to the lights.."
"If you are staying in the Marina area of Singapore you will see this unusual designed building lit up at night multiple colours and designs projected to the outside of this building. The iconic lotus inspired ArtScience Museum is worth visiting.There are exhibitions, events, performances and educational activities here, the Museum explores creative processes at the heart of art,science,technology and culture and their far- reaching influence in the world we live in.We visited one morning and decided to see the Minimalism, Space Light Object section of the museum . We really enjoyed viewing this exhibition one is able to photographs there as well as some interactive displays.How to get there?Get the MRT to Bayfront Station then it's a ten minute walk.Bus there is a bus stop at Bayfront Avenue the follow bus's go there SBS97,97E,133,133M,502,518, or SMRT 106.Taxi pick up and drop off near The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.Car the nearest car park is the North Car Park at Marina Bay Sands.Opening hours 10am-7pm with last admission at 6pm."
Took our Granddaughter to see the Future World exhibition. She is 14 months and loved it. Great lighting effects and opportunity for kids to draw pictures and see them appear in the displays. Would recommend for all children up to teenager and the Adults have fun too.
"I was looking for something to keep me busy and help fight jet lag after landing in Singapore on a Sunday morning. This exhibit was well beyond my expectations - one of the most memorable art experiences I've ever had. Most simply, it's art created with light that responds to your interaction. While much of it is child friendly (and there will be lots of families and kids) it is a joy to experience as well as to watch little kids enjoy. You realize these kids are growing up taking these feats of technology for granted. The exhibits are emotionally moving as well as playful. Pay close attention to details, be patient to watch the art evolve and you'll gain a deeper appreciation for the work."
"We went there for the Future World exhibition. It's fun for toddlers of any age up to teenagers, even adults get to play happily with those interactive games. Its indoor setting makes it a fun place no matter it's too hot or too wet outside, and we can easily park the car under MBS. Will take time to visit other exhibitions with the kids again."
A great attraction. Would reccomend doing. Have been to Future World exhibition many times - it is great for kids.
"ArtScience Museum is located within the integrated resort of Marina Bay Sands in the Central Area of Singapore. It was opened in 2011 and is said to be the world's first ArtScience museum. Although this place has a permanent exhibition, ArtScience Gallery, the ArtScience Museum mainly hosts touring exhibitions curated by other museums from all over the world.The building itself looks like a beautiful piece of art and it looks especially stunning at night with various light effects. Must visit the place to atleast admire the structural beauty !!! Tickets are not very expensive."
Amazing museum. Easy to get to super cool reality mixed with amazing projections. Kids will enjoy so much but adults also will enjoy quit a bit. The staff are super friendly and explain how things happen which makes it lot more enjoyable every now and then you have big crowd of kids flow through. I wish they better plan that flow. Also if the kids are better directed they would enjoy more and learn more.
"I had low expectations of this visit but it was fantastic! The exhibitions are well worth the $15 entry. We ended up spending several hours here. It's truly amazing. Essentially a modern/technology based art gallery. It's interactive for all ages including adults. It's more art than science, just that it's art created with modern technology. It's right at the end of the helix bridge beside the marina sands shopping centre. And the lotus lake outside the museum is also beautiful."
"Our daughter really had a fun time here. Same with all the children, and I believe parents. Paid for just the basic admission - future world. This includes entry to the digital light canvas located at B2 of the Marina Bay Sands mall (besides the overpriced from of court). While the museum was also expensive for what you actually get (not a traditional musuem at all), the kids really seemed to be excited throughout. An hour easily goes by, and another half hour for the digital light canvas."
"We visit ArtScience Museum Future World + Digital Light Canvas on our 2nd days in Singapore.Again, we booked our activities through the traveloka website, it cost IDR 129.105 per person.This is worth it!"
Architecturally beautiful to look at - a piece of Art just on its own. We went to look at the interactive Illumination exhibit.The kids really loved it (even the teenager) - they especially liked the illuminated balls and the Crystal curtain room at the end.We also looked at the Minimalism Exhibit there at the moment.
"Visited the museum for Future World exhibition. The staff at the counter was polite and helpful. The exhibition was fantastic, showing how the future could be with technology.The Crystal Universe exhibit was the best. With more than 170,000 LED lights, it gave the illusion of stars moving in space."
We are regulars when it comes to the Future World exhibition. I have an annual pass and bring my one year old boy here because he loves all the interactive and colourful displays. It's the best to see the wonder in his eyes. Highly recommend it for families with kids but it's also great for adults only.
"I chose the ArtScience museum as I had two (not so interested) teenagers with me. But it was a pleasure to see the girls engrossed during the entire visit.The exterior of the museum is beautiful and one wouldn't mind spending time outside the museum, soaking the sights of the Marina Bay. There were three exhibitions on when we visited - future world, All possible paths (Richard Feynman) and Minimalism. The huge exhibits, complete with digital technology, colours, light, sounds, notes tickled our senses. My favourite was the sliver LED light curtain through which I walked feeling like I was in Interstellar!""Into the Wild"" - is a immersive virtual experience more suited to kids, where you walk in the corridor with iPads.There could be a requirement to deposit your belongings for some exhibitions and refraining from flash photography."
It's an interesting visit because the museum is very informative and interactive. There are also a lot of exhibits that are children-friendly. A must visit in Singapore.
Located in the world famous lotus a like shaped building in marina bay sands complex.Children friendly place to play with virtual technology and science.Several exhibitions can be show in the same time. Recommended for family outing.
"Worth the visit. Not crowded. Plenty for kids young & old to enjoy. Adults also would benefit with the exhibitions we saw very informative and challenging. Staff very helpful, great little gift shop too."
"So besides being an amazing building/work of art itself, this museum contains a long term exhibition (Future world) and a variety of shorter term exhibitions on other floors. if you have kids, then future world is just awesome. It features an interactive light and sensory and craft experience. it's also huge. There's not 4 things to create, build, try, play, slide down etc... theres LOADS!!!! From whole sensory rooms with surround interactive light shows to pictures you colour then scan and upload to interactive walls. BUT IT GOES ONE STEP FURTHER... -- it can take your scan upload it to another machine and print a card template for you to make a 3D MODEL! It was super great. I made one there and printed the rest to take back to the hotel to do later. They won't survive the suitcase home but were fun to make.While I was there, I saw a graffiti exhibition on the upper floors, though I think that part of the exhibition space changes regularly and tickets for those are sold separately.Don't miss this."
"Very very impressive , def something to do , try the future world , it was so beautiful and the kids would love it as well"
"What an experience . The art science museum is a treat for the eyes and the mind. Everything is so rich and engagingThe LED room reminded me of Matrix. The butterfly exhibit was mesmerizing. But my favorite was the one where I could scan my images and they would come on the digital screen and become a part of the civilization. It's such a nice experience for kids and adults both.Loved it, my best stop at Singapore."
For me this museum was one of the highlights of my visit to Singapore. They had multiple exhibitions but all three where in their own way really worth while visiting. Also the building on it's own in a marvel from the outside as well as from the inside.
"Came here during the last time slot of the day and wasn't too busy, although the queue for the LED lights room did get pretty long towards the end. Lots of beautiful digital displays like the flowers and waterfall, and the slide looked quite cool as well.This is definitely more of a kids place, but we actually ended up having a lot of fun (kids at heart!). We also enjoyed the room where you can do crayon drawings that come to life on the big screens.Only thing I would suggest is that for the room with all the LED lights, most people going in just seem to want a good photo, but there was a staff member just standing in the middle the WHOLE time at the end, which was pretty annoying. I feel like that prolongs the people in there trying to get a good photo because then they are trying to find an angle where someone (aka the staff member) isn't just loitering in the background of all the photos. It's actually much more efficient just to have a staff member standing at the entrance and the exit of the room to tell people to hurry, than having someone stand in the centre and ruining people's shots."
"The famous lotus flower building houses the museum, full of interactive exhibitions and was like nothing I'd ever seen before. Many of the exhibitions were busy, it's very family friendly which can mean lots of children present, but that didn't take away from the enjoyment. "
ArtScience Museum is a good place to spend a few hours with your young children on a day after you have visited the bay area. Kids will have some fun playing with interactive artworks that are made by themselves.
"Based on the outlook you know that this building is very unique. Inside it has different sorts of exhibition going on. There were the wildlife, or futuristic. Previously they had the marvel avengers exhibition as well. Is a MUST see place"
"We booked the Future Worlds ticket. It was very short, so don't think you'll be spending much time (unless you're with children). The second element of the exhibition was breathtaking. Really glad we visited and got to experience."
"Purchased the family package for 2 adults + 2 children tickets, plus a 15% off using Standard Chartered credit card. Total of S$76 was worth it, considering we visited all three exhibitions and a workshop.Future World:Kiddos still loved the interactive art+science exhibits in the dark hall. Lots of fun sliding, crawling in tunnels, moving giant balls and ""landscaping"", creating digital hop scotches and jumping on them, walking into a room of glittery, floating crystals, etc. Skipped the coloring+projection part since they've tried that umpteen times here and elsewhere.Disney: Magic of Animation:This one probably excites the adults more, because you get to view the real drawings from 1930s all through the war in the 1940s till present day 2020. All the genuine drawings in here must be precious, not-for-sale, irreplaceable collectibles. Kids still enjoyed it here because of the short movie clips at each exhibit and a mini artwork area in the middle. Adults probably will enjoy it for the walk down memory lane and history. Truly, appreciating the art of animating, behind the art form.2219: Futures Imagined:Was expecting something futuristic and fun like the Future World next door, but was surprised that the overarching theme was pretty gloomy. The future imagined in this exhibition is a post-apocalyptic one, where most people have supposedly died and the remaining are struggling to survive in the dejected-looking streets left behind. Probably a good and realistic way to educate the kids (and ourselves) what the future may look like if we don't take care of our only habitable planet Earth, now. The end of this exhibition was... hopeful? For you to find out.Extra tip:Enjoy the views of the bay and Singapore's metropolitan skyline from outside the museum, the cute amphibian Duck Tours boat shuttling by, the Helix bridge, and the building itself is gorgeous. Great place to hang out for windy breezes."
"Attended the Disney exhibition, and was very impressed at the overall aesthetic of the exhibition. Thoroughly enjoyed my time there :)"
Visited here with my husband. Just went for the basic entry ticket.Most of the exhibits are interactive. Thoroughly enjoyable for both children and adults.A very different type of museum.
The Art and Science museum is housed in the very unique lotus shaped building by Marina Bay Sands. It has various floors for different themed exhibitions and displays. I enjoyed their light and art imagination displays. Very popular with children. The next section on Disney animation was quite interesting as well. Good for those with children to spend an afternoon interacting with the different displays.
"A playground of lights, laser, projections, and all sorts art stuffs using visual effects. Kids will love it for sure, even adults do. This kind of attraction is already available in many places including my hometown but it's always nice to experience it someplace else. It has a cool artsy building."
"Ongoing from now till 29 March 2020! However, due to high visitation this festive season, would recommend to purchase admission tickets online beforehand so as to avoid the queue. Exhibition was really stunning. I personally enjoyed it a lot and I felt like I was a princess!"
"A journey through the evolution of disney movies, from Mickey Mouse to Beauty and the Beast to Zootopia, and of course, Frozen 2.Flash the movie ticket stub from Frozen 2 to get 25% discount off the exhibition ticket."
"There are several great interactive experiences at ArtScience Museum. Fun for all ages. There are ones that are aimed specifically for children as well. Unfortunately like all other popular experience/locations, you have to contend with those that hold up progress by selfishly spending too much time trying to get their perfect photo/video."
"""Space"" is definitely the most attractive and memorable experience, part of the Future World exhibit. An immersive experience in ever changing colours and lights which amazes you (and may feel slightly disoriented as to space and dimensions, but it is a very safe space to be in).Children will enjoy all parts of this exhibit, especially Park, with huge interactive balls change colour.Personally, I found the 2219 Future Imagined exhibit quite depressing, presenting a dystopian view of the world (I bet everyone thinks: I'm glad I won't be around in 2219). Not really suitable for children.Overall, definitely worth a visit and marvel at how art and technology can be used together to create new visual experiences. Not to mention the amazing 'lotus hand' building."
"If you have around an hour to spare, this is a perfect place to go. Easily accessible from Marina Bay Sands shopping centre. Very futuristic, plenty of interactive activities. I thoroughly enjoyed making my own fish and vehicle and see it come to life on the big screen.Suitable for young children as well as young adults.Lots of photo opportunities! If you're a Disney fan I would also recommend visiting the Disney Magic of Animation exhibition.We spent around an hour in the museum and half an hour at the Disney exhibition. I would suggest pre-purchasing tickets online to save you the hassle."
"On my previous trip to Singapore, we had a free afternoon and while wandering around Marina Bay Sands, we came across this place and chose to view ""Lego"" exhibition. It was a different and satisfying experience.This time around, we allotted a couple of hours to it and were again delighted by ""Future World"" and ""Disney"". Surprisingly, ""future world"" was enjoyed more by kids and I think the title was misleading. It had little to do with the future of the world and had more of flashy games.For fans of animation movies like me, going through the journey of Disney was such a delight ! Have seen all movies by Pixar and hope they host a exhibition on Pixar some day."
"I was taken back a bit by the lack of size of the place. Everything in Singapore is large, but not this Museum. The displays are the same that I can see anywhere else. Good but not great and very busy with school groups. Restaurant and outside Museum the best."
"It was a children-friendly place with many entertainment and educational materials. My favorite exhibition was unfortunately temporary, and by now it must have ended. While you're there, you can also check the other nearby attractions like the 'The Shops at Marina Bay Sands'."
"Recently went to see the Disney Animation exhibition. Highly recommend it, but it's not for young children. This is for adults and art students who can appreciate the developmental process and brilliance of Walt Disney and his team over the years."
The Alice in Wonderland exhibition was great! We had an interactive map where you looked out for your character's icon whilst touring around. The museum had a range of artwork that you could see - some interactive which was fun!
"I visited the museum with no expectations. The exhibits were pretty interesting. All of the exhibits are interactive and family-friendly. Since most of the exhibits are involving lights, the whole atmosphere was pretty dark."
There's nothing interesting to see. In fact there's practically nothing about science. It's good for kids who like drawing.
First of all you need to decide what you want to see when buying a ticket. It's not just a ticket for a museum. This place is split into different galleries with different exhibits and you need to choose which ones to see.There are lots of interesting interactive displays but they are mostly taken up by children and as an adult you can't get in to many of them. At one point I started to worry that it was actually a kids attraction and I'd come by mistake so I left a couple of the galleries without seeing much at all.As a solo adult or couple I wouldn't bother with this one unless you have time to kill but if you have inquisitive youngsters then I think they'd love this.
The ticketing staff and also the manager don't know the discounted price for students. With an ISIC Student Card you get 12$ Off all Access ticket! They need about 30mins to double check it and told me that's wrong on the voucher. Don't pay for that way of business!
If you've seen Japan's teamlab then this is very disappointing. I was very excited to see exhibition because I had already seen the one in Japan. But very disappointed. May be because I've already seen the best one that is 10000 times better. The Disney animation is just a maze of sketches of how the cartoons are sketched out. And the future world also sorry but we just wanted to get over and out of it. Only the Crystal room was very pretty we went in twice to see it. The rest was useless.
"Architecture of the building was unique and lotus pond outside of the museum was pretty. We saw large crowd so expected it to be something exciting and worthy. Boy were we tricked. Some parts started with high hopes but than it was huge let down as nothing of real substance is shown or displayed there. We paid for all 3 exhibitions there and all were waste of time. Original Disney drawings were cool to see but there was nothing else there worth my time or money. Perhaps if it was a free or nominal fee, it might be something to do if you had nothing else going on that day. Honestly, I feel like I got ripped off. All 6 of us couldn't stop laughing due to our feeling of 'taken'. Don't waste your time here as there are plenty of other things to do in Singapore that'll cost less money and more enjoyment."
"Sorry but thru the Future World, we nearly ran as nearly everything was for small kidsDisney was more intersting but we had to wait a while, even with tickets. 2219 was somehow interesting, but all in all, I would say that money wasn't worth it, sorry."
Ideal place for Instagram worthy pics. Families with young kids would reap the maximum out of this museum. Good way to spend an hour or maybe two maximum.
"Yes it is a iconic architectural landmark with a catchy and deceiving name.This lotus inspired, ingeniously named 'ArtScience Museum' isprivately owned by the Marina Bay Sands Group, who own the casino and hotel of the same name.Feng Shui is said to play an important hand in the design here and it literally does! Surely you can visualise the shape of a palm seemingly grasping or trying to contain something. Probably the hefty 19sgd entrance fees, LOL.The ArtScience Museum is far from being a proper museum per say, as are the Singapore National Museum, Art Museum and Science Centre, which are the real deal. Yes, there are often free exhibitions in collaboration with who's who, that are worthy of a visit here if you so happen to be in the neighbourhood. This is just one section perhaps dedicated to the subject of Arts and Science which is free. This in turn tempts one into imagining what's to see in the paid section of the ArtScience Museum. Many assume there should be more of the same, only better. Yet it is the actual ArtScience Museum that one gets dissapointed with and anyone who reads the grouses on on TripAdvisor should know if this is really their scene.Do not expect the ArtScience Museum to be at all like Singapore's mainstream museum. This is pretty much a OTT children's amusement centre in technicolor. Albeit, a fusion one at best. Not at all recommended for anyone above fourteen years of age.The only adults you will find inside the ArtScience Museum is likely to fall into one of the categories below. They would be :1. Tourist's who believed it was Museum of Art & Science. (They would be the unhappy in expressing their views here)2. Extroverts on social media chasing the selfies and instagram likes. ( Because it might be raining outside or they have nothing currently worthy to post)3. Parents/Grandparents (myself included) who accompany the young children. (They will be looking for the true art and science section of this museum only to find none)It is claimed the future is created here at the ArtScience Museum, but all I felt the entire time, was like I was walking thru a long psychedelic kaleidoscope. In all fairness thou, my fourteen month old grandson enjoyed himself here immensely attracted by all the movements and colors.Entertainment for some perhaps, but certainly not Science and if at all it is deemed as Art, it is Art without much content.Go if a myriad of moving projected images of luminous technicolor on the floor, walls, ceilings and slides is your kinda playground. Yes, that's right, there are two slides and I betcha this is the only museum with a indoor slide in the world.Older children who enjoy illustration can have their works projected on the walls while there and that's about as arty as it gets. Activities for the children will keep them occupied in a low light environment for some time without parents ever having to worry about sun stroke.Do remember to bring a camera for low light photography as no flash photography is allowed. One exits by walking thru a prism of blinding bright white LED lights set against mirrors. The grand finale of harsh lights to walk thru was a Christmas overload.Overall an entertaining time for young children. Hopefully, future playgrounds will not be as dark and mindless as this self proclaimed museum!"
I'd give it zero stars if I could. One of the worst exhibitions I've ever visited. 95% is a creche where kids can play and draw. Why aren't couples without kids warned when buying tickets that's it is purely for children. Horrendous waste of money and was c.10 minutes start to finish.
"We had a spare 2 hours and didn't have much to do, so we decided to give it a try. We only paid for the future world exhibit as was not interest in Disney. However it has nothing to do with science, it was literally a high tech kids play area. The only good thing is the space part for a photo but that takes 2 minutes so not really worth it"
A small art gallery housing technologically interesting pieces aimed towards the smaller patrons. I was able to take away some interesting ideas but felt I couldn't experience the best the ArtScience Museum had to offer due to being too old.
"Not worth the admission price. The ""Future World"" really has nothing to do with visions of the future, and even less to do with art or science. Many of the exhibits are variations of the same thing - projected video on to walls that is mildly interactive. It's good enough to kill some time if you've got little kids, but it's definitely not worth a visit for anyone else. Other than the Future World exhibit, the second floor was closed, and the third floor houses a well-meaning, but ultimately halfhearted effort in a climate change exhibit. For such a great space and prominent location in town, we expected a lot more from this flop of a ""museum"" (yes, that word should be in quotes!)"
"We went to the future world exhibition. There were a lot of children interacting with the displays. Interesting exhibition but I was sort of disappointed that it ended. I remember when we found the exit, we both actually said, 'That's it? '"
"Went specifically to see the Alice in Wonderland exhibition. It was super cool, the AI and AV stuff is really clever. Well worth the price. Brilliant."
"This is neither a museum nor has it anything to do with art or science. Its basically a big play ground for kids. If you are willing to pay 19 SGD for that, go ahead! My advice: Go there to take pictures from the building, the architecture is nice, but dont go inside. Save your money and go to a real museum. There are a lot really good museums in Singapore."
"The building is amazing but we were so disappointed with the exhibition. Possibly we may have been unfortunate, we were advised that one exhibition was full with school children. The other which we paid for was about the history of inflatables. Pictures and screen pictures were of poor quality and non of the audio worked."
Singapore has a lot of unique looking building especially along the harbor but this one is really unique. It's something to see.
"This AS museum is a great place for kids only. It took me a few minutes in the 3 exhibitions. The current ones are The Future, Allice in Wonderland & Floating Utopias. The ideas are great. The Floating Utopia was not so unique at all. The Alice one was well arranged and organised and surely great for kids. The Future is again for kids with the digital animation. None of the exhibitions were mentally stimulating or intellectually interesting. However, the execution by the Australian company was great.SEE photos."
"I went there before (few years ago) and I really enjoyed. However, this time I was disappointed by the exhibitions ""Future World"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"". It's fun for kids but nor really interesting for adults."
"This was the only disappointment on a 4 day visit to Singapore, it is genuinely terrible, so poor we just laughed about it. The best view is outside - the building structure is unique, just don't go inside:1. Each exhibition is priced individually, the general admission lets you enter the building foyer and gift concession only.2. The exhibitions are small, 5 minutes in each and you're done.3. They are eccentric (the transformative power of inflatable art ?!)4. If you've toddlers then the playground slides and lights in Futurewolrd they might be impressed (though much the same stuff is available in the shopping mall food court and at least you can eat/drink while you watch the kids and save money).Honestly there a much better things to do in Singapore and if art is your passion then go to the Art Museum where they actually have some art or the National Gallery or Civilizations Museum."
"we attended only the main exhibit with our 15 and 16 year old children. A majority of the displays were catered to younger children (under ten). Colouring activities, a slide, etc. The final room (filled with lights and crystals) was very cool (a short wait to get in, and staff hustled everyone through to keep the line moving). We were told to allocate 45 minutes to an hour for the visit, we were done in about 15, including the wait for the last room. The building exterior is very cool looking, got some great photos outside."
We went to the future world. The big moon thing was closed due to service. It took us like less than 10 min to see everything. I would recommend it only to families with kids. It's nothing for teens or adults.
"We expected a lot more from this wonderful building which appears to be at the core of the Marina Bay Sands complex. Art is a personal thing but for us, it was definitely not worth the entrance fee. Suggest you have a look online before visiting so you can make up your mind."
"We went for the all access tickets as wasn't sure what we'd see (or miss!) and wandered through. Wonderland; I didn't get much from this not being a massive fan of the film's or books some interesting stuff but nonetheless. Future world; colourful is best to describe this but seemed aimed at young kids who were all over the place! Enjoyed going round, but again nothing special. Floating; I quite liked this just big inflatable stuff, not much else I can offer! We didn't encounter any queues, except for inside the exhibits with all the ""Insta-models"" hogging up space. Easier enough to get in just use the self service kiosks if paying by card."
There are 3 main exhibitions - we opted for Wonderland and Futureworld. We were told it would be about 40 mins per exhibition; Futureworld was about that but the queues in Wonderland made it around 100 mins (about 50 mins of queuing). There was a huge queue to get tickets in the first place so recommend you get them online first (Klook is a good app).Futureworld. Ability to wonder through some of the exhibitions. Great for kids but not sure you would get much of it on your own. Some good ideas; the interactive slide and infinity mirror were highlights (although queue for mirror could have been managed much better as it was due to people taking photographs).Wonderland. An excellent idea well executed. This was the highlight and lowlight of the visit. Long queue (30 mins) just to get in to the exhibition. The exhibition was a great meld of tech and traditional artefacts. The best part is the interactive screen where you take a picture of your face and then see it emerge on the screen on the body of one of the Queen's soldiers - its better than it sounds! Huge queue for the Mad Hatters Tea Party (another 30 mins). An interesting display but if queue anymore than 10 mins I would skip
It was expensive entry fee for what it was. It is more suitable for young children. Not worth bothering.
"We visited on a Monday afternoon (by the way, discounted rates for locals) as a group of adults; we arrived at 3pm which meant there weren't any queues or waits to go to the exhibitions... entrance was around S$36 for non- residents for all the exhibits, less for just one or two. It's constantly updated and the building itself is amazing! Make sure you see all the exhibits and go to the top floor which has huge cinema rooms showing relevant films (e.g UP and red balloon for the floating exhibition). The wonderland exhibition was great fun and all of the museum is interactive for adults and kids! Spent 2 hours here"
"Went along today and visited Future World with our 12 year old. A few limited light shows, a slide and balls for kids and an ok but very short space exhibit offered 25 minutes of 'entertainment'. Very poor fare."
Admission was $19 SGP for one exhibit. I chose World of Tomorrow - which was incredibly cool except that every single visitor over age 12 turned it into a disgusting spectacle of selfie-taking.
Went with high expectations but was quite disappointed.We went for the lighting illustrations and Alice in wonderland. Purchased the all access tickets.It was quite an average display.Don't think it's worth the price we paid to enter.
"The prices were quite high (like all of Singapore) so we could only afford to do go through one of the exhibits, which I think was called 'Future World'? For us the only good bit was when you walk through a path surrounded by dangling lights. Loads of kids running around in certain areas. I'm sure people more into art would enjoy the museum more, I struggled to find much in the way of interesting science."
"The outlook is awesome especially the pond surrounding is full of lotus. There are 3 exhibitions now, future, wonderland and floating utopian. I buy double exhibitions ticket at S$32 for Future and Floating Utopian. Honestly, if you are adult without kids, it's a little bit waste time to see Future. Floating Utopian is comparatively ok."
"There's no privilege to getting an annual membership. Still got to queue in the long line, must re-key in details every single time (can't even use machine to do that), time wasted, no fast pass, no priority queue, no preview... and on a school holiday, only 2 staff mending the ticket counter."
"We visited the ArtScience Museum to see the latest Star Wars Identities exhibition. It includes some great pieces - props, costumes and artwork from the original trilogy, prequels and the more recent 'sequel trilogy'.The experience is centered around the concept of building an identity - whereby you 'check in' at different stages and select characteristics and experiences to build your character. I found it a bit pointless to be honest. It would have been much more interesting if there was more information on the history and process behind the film production and the people involved.Unfortunately the experience was spoiled somewhat when we tried to feed our young daughter with formula milk - we were told that it was not allowed inside the exhibition hall (even for breastfeeding babies apparently) and we had to go all the way round the exhibition to exit and then come back in again."
"This used to be our favourite museum, but this time was disappointing. We had to buy tickets online, but their website just wouldn't work."
"We visited this museum thinking it was a science museum, in fact it seems to be a centre where displays of art and some science are put on like an exhibition. We did enjoy the Disney display showing how the famed Disney films we're made over the decades and the history of animation, well worth a visit. worth checking to see what is on before you go."
"I have been to Singapore 4 times and with all the walking and things to do I had come so close but never gone into the art science muaeaum at Marina BaySo this time I didI guess I thought I was going to a science center sort of like what I remember from the so radio science center with lots of machines and techWhich is probably the reason I never entered here before as I know that the real science centres of machines and tech are not her thingLike me going to an art museum I could be in and out in 5 mi utesThose famous guys painted because they hadn't invented cameras yetAnd now because these fellows are long gone the art value has gone crazy?????But this one place is differentIt really explodes scince ideas within the realm of artThe exhibits had some brilliant computer technology behind their ideas but interestingly enough. It was really designed and set up more for kids, young ones , with their parents. Very interactively driven with kids own drawings as source for the experimentsIn retrospect judging by the photos I have savedWell worth the visit. 2 hours is plenty"
Not strictly an Art & Science Museum but a great place for children to enjoy themselves through interactive light & sound.
"The architecture of the ArtScience Museum is stunning. The is seen from the outside and the inside, although you can walk the all the inside floors for free without entering the exhibits. We did the full exhibit tour and there were three open when we were there. The really wasn't any science link to any of them, but the one on balloons did try to add some technical aspects. There were several high-tech video installations, but all the focus was on visuals and not the underlying technology. Our daughters enjoyed the interactive drawing parts and playing with the balls that change color based on how fast they are going, but as other reviewers say, there isn't much of particular interest for adults. The Wonderland exhibit was heavily hyped, but it was mainly a presentation of all the books/movies based on the story so more history than anything else. We all found that interesting, but neither Art nor Science."
"The best way to enjoy this iconic building is to admire it from the outside. Compared to government-owned museums (like the National Gallery or Asian Civilisation Museum), this one has the highest price AND the lowest amount of interesting content. The current three exhibitions are enjoyable for young children below 22 years old. Otherwise, they are just collections of low-operating-costs (or even low set-up costs) items. Yet, because of the high appeal to young children, queues can be quite long on weekends. Sometimes, farting can made queuing quite toxic. No wonder Japanese tourists keep their masks on. The 3 stars is an average of 4 stars for families with young children and 2 stars for others."
Went to the wonderland exhibition. The museum is big but found most of the content gimmicky esp the last part. My 4-yr old nephews enjoyed themselves though.
One good way to spend your day with kids. We got tickets for both Artscience and wonderland. Kids enjoyed it to some degree.
"Being Sands lifestyle members, we used the 1-1 option, although the catch was the 1-1 only applied to standard (non-Singaporean) price and not local price. The counter staff, Catherine, was not very helpful and undeniably rude. If not for the kids looking forward, we would have turned back (separate feedback has already been conveyed to MBS). The Future World exhibition was cool, innovative and educational. The kids loved the interactive segments and enjoyed themselves. Wonderland, however, promised much, but was not really up to par. Sure, the exhibits on original literary works of Lewis Caroll and videos of first ever live adaptions of the classic story was interesting, but there seemed to something missing. The map provided also had riddles to keep the kids busy while they maneuvered the exhibitions but they soon lost interest. The digital interactive Mad Hatters Tea Party was a non-event despite the hype. Save for projected graphics, it was nothing to shout about. Overall, FutureWorld, although an exhibit that's been around longer than Wonderland, was way better."
"If you are an ardent fan of Alice in Wonderland, then this is the place for you as the exhibits do go into details of the main characters. Well organised exhibit, with numerous versions of Alice, a few versions of Alice were a bit eerie looking. Not sure little kids will like the exhibit. All in all, I don't find it worthwhile a visit.Tips:Join free Sands membership and get 1 for 1 ticket (include child ticket).On non school holiday and non public holiday, Fridays are free for kids with an adult ticket purchase.Museum opens at 10am, no need to go early as they ONLY open the doors at 10am sharp."
"The ArtScience museum is worth a visit for its architecture. Once inside, the exhibitions are not always overwhelming and do not totally meet expectations. The current ""digital meets art"" exhibition, in partnership with Tokyo's teamlab is more of a young kid's playground.Likewise, Wonderland is better suited for fans of Alice's adventures..OK for a couple of hours."
"You can't think of this place as an art exhibition space, rather as a venue designed for hosting children's parties and school excursions. As two 30 year olds without kids expecting a series of cutting-edge light installations, we felt horribly out-of-place at the ArtScience museum.We were finished in 10 minutes: the interactive light installations used in all the publicity are simplistic and very small in reality. In between these two photogenic spaces are countless activities just for children, including a small slide, crayon drawing stations and a ball pit. Even though they were all in gleeful use by a large school group, it was hard to ascribe any of these activities with the artistic or scientific merit suggested by the museum's name. Considering how expensive admission is, it was a major let-down due to the huge disparity between reality and museum's marketing."
"Cool building, a bit pricey but you get a discount for joining the Sands Reward program. Art display was small (took less than 10 mins to see them all)."
"I was really looking forward to this museum. I had heard such great reviews and everyone raved about it. Yes, this is a nice museum and has some great attractions. However, if you are an adult you will be done this museum fairly quickly.I did the regular museum + Alice in Wonderland. The entire time at the museum was around 1 hour. The Alice in Wonderland exhibit was done very well and I am glad that I added that onto my regular ticket. You get to see from start to finish how Alice in Wonderland has progressed, and go through some obstacles as well. It is a very fun exhibit and I would certainly do this one again.The main exhibit however was a bit dull. It is great for kids so if you have kids this is at least half a day. I saw plenty of families playing around with a lot of the different objects they have throughout. For adults though I would say this isn't a must-do while in Singapore. I went here while it was raining and it was perfect for that. Besides the light display that I am sure you have seen all over Instagram there isn't too much more to it. I spent most of my time inside the light display.So, yes, there is a lot here to do for families but if you are an adult and / or by yourself I would say you can skip this. I would do the special exhibit though no matter what!"
Fantastic architecture but regular exhibits inside. Better for kids rather than adults.I expected more. Nice if you are curious but not worth the money spent there.
"Our morning here was fine, but nothing special for the price we paid, $27.20 for both exhibits with discount for showing our Singapore airlines boarding pass.We preferred the Future World exhibit to the Minimalism."
"We went there on a Saturday morning so there were lots of tourists, it was still enjoyable and memorable experience. Highly recommend to people who love technology and art"
"We visited during Future World exhibit, as two adults this was average, if we were kids it would have been brilliant. Hangy Crystal world thing was cool but I would probably not go again. All exhibits have additional ticket fee, would be better if you just paid entrance fee and could visit all areas of museum. Set up/layout of museum is weird too."
"A lukewarm experience overall. Of the 7 or 8 exhibits on display at FutureWorld, they certainly saved the best one for the end. However, a lot of the interactive exhibits in between are primarily for kids under 13, so you don't really come away feeling like you've learned anything new or seen anything that can leave you truly awestruck (barring the final exhibit which is admittedly quite cool). The aesthetics of FutureWorld are great for social media fanatics, however."
Enjoyed the unique art works on display. Modern and engages you into the minds of the artist. The place is kept quiet and serene by the many security personal. However they are not too friendly towards the young kids. I don't blame them as the works are fragile and little hands like to touch!The basement has a wonderful light show for the kids though that's worth trying out.
We only went in because we had time to kill and its air conditioned. Otherwise I wouldn't put it very high on the list of things to do in singapore. Kids would enjoy the future world section with its interactive visual graphics so take them if they need occupying for an hour or so.
"We were excited to visit the ArtScience Museum solely because of the interesting design of the building itself. We visited the Future World and Marvel exhibits. Both were ok, but I wouldn't recommend visiting either."
I visited this place when I got some free time in the afternoon. It was OK but not mandatory. Just visit only if you have free time. Better place for kids.
"Very interactive museum, one of the exhibits was closed when we visited which we were not aware of before hand which was a shame. Lots of opportunity to get involved, however felt it was a little small given the price. I don't think it is well advertised but we bought our tickets from the theatre in the neighbouring shopping mall, which was a good shout as when we walked a few minutes to the museum the queue there was over 20 minutes according to the signs."
"We went to see exhibition as one of the must!, My son is a big fan of the artist since 2 year olds, i played video clip of this art instead of cartoon, then it was bless to know this exhibition is held in south east asia, we fly to see this exhibition without hesitate!The exhibition was good as it's standard, fit the place perfect esp. the main high-light hall.But the worst thing happened when my son was stopped from a staff when he was carefully moving the beast (experiment zone) as he is too small and can't move 'her' smoothly, and again when the small group lecture come (only 2 people with booking?), then we need to leave as we run out of time to the airport.I was admired the place as it's part of shopping mall, great ideal to connect people with art as apart of life but now this art seems to unreachable like it was before or still in some developing country...My son seems to lost his interest on the main highlight but still making his own beast by lego (he is 7 year olds) Luckily when staff said 'No, you can't do it!' doesn't haunting him."
"Windwalkers is rather interesting and good but a small scale exhibition. Marvel is really meant for hard-core fans and can be rather boring for most. Future is interesting and a great fun place for kids. All in all, one may not find it worthwhile the entry fee unless there is a promotion such as kids go free on fridays.Tip: Join Sands membership for free and get one-for-one entry ticket.https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294265-d2138895-r603164918-ArtScience_Museum_at_Marina_Bay_Sands-Singapore.html#"
"Wonderful location with the hotel and shopping mall right next to the museum, also the marina is close by.The museum has some interesting exhibits but a lot of it is geared towards young children.The additional graffiti exhibition was very good."
"Cool and unique looking museum worth visiting for the architecture alone. The architecture reminds us of a bunch of bananas, which is quite suitable being located near the durian Esplanade theater.In the museum a quote is printed; 'There's only one difference between art and science. In science, universe is in control and in art, you are', so I guess this museum attempts to either remove control from both you and the universe, or give both you and universe control. Either way that sets some pretty ambitious expectations of the experiences to gain from a visit.We visited the exhibition future world, and visiting with a young kid was pretty fun. Rather small exhibition but some quite exciting things for the kids to do. It's clearly an exhibition geared towards young children so if you're a family visiting Singapore then this is a great stop."
"I went to see 'Treasures of the Natural World' which was an average exhibit. Thus the rating. I didn't look at the rest of the museum. The building is interesting. The world's classiest food court is in the building next door, lower level. You can have your $85 chili crab there and all kinds of interesting food."
The building architecture is different (Lotus shaped). The art and science museum is different theme. It has around 4-5 big rooms. There are art work (Painting). It is linked to some scientific themes. Will be interesting for those who love art and painting. Yo may need to plan for about 1-2 hours.
"We visited the Future exhibit. It was interesting, without young children the whole thing would take 10-15mins. Not really worth the entry cost of S$15each.My 10yo liked the exhibit and even he said it wasn't worth the money."
"In addition, the main attraction, the lamps room with fiber optics and digital vision around the ground, is FREE on the food court (floor B1).Very expensive, very short, and for .young children only"
"After seeing this museum from the outside last year, I finally took the plunge and went to see the happenings of the inside.When you walk through the doors, head for the elevator straight ahead or take the escalator on the left, that will take you B1. There isn't a huge sign, one on the side of the escalator but hard to miss because of the coffee shop. Also, the staff hanging around don't seem to want to help those who don't know.However, that was just upstairs - the folks downstairs are nicer! :DeCome here and be overwhelmed with lights, everywhere. Even take some time and chill out on a beanbag to have a quick nap or update your friends. From there until the last light section is mainly for kids. There are lots of activities for them!I was expecting something a little more, it's kinda boring if you aren't a kid. And the last sections with all the lights that change colour is the only appealing area. Maybe an update and making it more futuristic would be better."
Amazing structure however once inside you don't really feel the shape of the outside of the building. So much better from outside. Spend your time relaxing sitting around the lily ponds below the structure admiring the building and all around it. We took the lift to the top floor hoping there would be some sort of view of the building or a viewing platform but nothing. The box office and galleries are mostly on the lower levels as you enter. It is very expensive to enter any of the exhibitions so we did not bother at all. There was a free wildlife trail using hand held virtual reality screens that was fantastic. It is from WWF Singapore and was a great little wander around. There are so many more fun and interesting places to visit in Singapore than are just as good or better and definitely less expensive. Check what exhibitions are on before you go and how much it is to enter and then you can decide.
"The building is beautiful, shaped like a lotus, the exhibition on at the moment is very geared towards children. It's art in the form of digital technology and the images are beautiful. The main room is very child orientated with a slide, creating areas and lots of projected images. Perfect for children, not that great for adults visiting on their own, thought it was a bit expensive."
"After reading the reviews we decided not to go in to the museum, however the architecture of the building is amazing and striking."
"On reading about the exhibit my Husband was keen to go.The future human exhibit wasn't all that good.. It was mostly art, less science. However it was airconditioned, and being the first day in Singapore again, it was nice.....I would give other exhibits ago next time i am in Singapore, I wouldn't bother with the Future Human one again. I think it is advertised incorrectly."
"We had a very poor introduction to purchasing tickets for the Art Science Museum.As a Sands Reward Club member, I am entitled to receive a free adult ticket for every adult ticket purchased, up to two every month.On Fridays, up to four children are entitled to enter the Museum free of charge for every adult ticket purchased. The staff were obstinate that I couldn't receive the free tickets for my two children. This is despite that there is no term or condition that prevents this. They stated that it would be combining offers or promotions. Yet this is something that surely would have been contemplated and explicitly excluded, but is definitely not. Maybe I am the first person to do this. They argued back and forwards, but refused to have a senior manager come speak to me. Its a Singaporean thing!However, the shnorrer in me was not going to back down.Eventually a manager did come after an hour. I had one question for her; what is the cost of an ""All Access"" adult ticket on Fridays with the free children's tickets when paying with my NETS card? the answer was SGD$38.00 less 15% equals SGD$32.30. You see, in September there was a special of 15% discount with the NETS card.Ah Ha! I had them and they knew the game was up. This is because it would be combining offers or promotions which they had wrongly and incessantly argued.We went to all the exhibitions and completed the tour in a little over two hours.Great for children, not too long or in depth. They weren't bored at all.Very poor value if you pay the normal price.Luckily my persistence payed off by saving SGD$90.00"
"It looks interesting from afar, but inside a different story. Expensive entry (if you are a tourist). One permanent display -- which is meant to typify art/science: it is kind of cool on a first visit, but you wouldn't want to return... especially given the hoards of local school kids who turn the place into bedlam (obviously, they don't pay the tourist entry fee!). The two visiting shows vary over time... when we went, one was trite, the other ho-hum. Maybe you'll catch something better. Avoid weekends: Singaporeans for some obscure reason flock to the place."
right on Marina Baythe building is so nice and one of the icon of the Bayin fact there is 3 majors expoone per floorbut you need to purchase one ticket per attractionit s a really interactive museumgood for all the familylittle bit expensive for a big family
From outside the building is amazing. Inside is not too interesting.we saw the future world exibition.it was good but not something to remember long time. To go there take the mrt to bayfront station and there are signs which lead you.
"Tip: If you sign up for the Sands Hotel program (Free) you get a free ticket per accoiunt to this museum.Its a museum where art meets science and it is more of a kids museum than for adults. It is fun if you are 7, and just noisey as heck if you are over 30. But, it is a good rainy day activity"
"Personally, I found this heavy going ' there were three separate exhibitions with the facility to purchase tickets separately or choose a combo of more than one ' as we only had a relatively short amount of time to spend here we asked the ticket clerk to recommend to us ' Future World our first choice was busy with a school group ' so she suggested Universe and Art ' no a good choice I am afraid as I found it bordering on dull. There was an additional 'free' exhibit Into the Wild on the top floor which we wandered into but did not have the recommended 'device' to really enjoy - probably just as well as we left when a group of unsupervised and unruly school children arrived and took the venue over - disappointing"
"I thought I'd duck into Futureworld to kill time. There are some light shows that at least have some good production values, then a lot of interactive games that the kids were loving but I got bored with after 10 minutes."
You will have to pay separate entrance fees for each exhibit. Went to the FutureWorld Exhibit. Nothing very futuristic about it..just a play with lights. Lights dancing..lights following you around..lights light up in various designs..you get the picture..
"We bought the ticket for the 3 active exhibitions, and I'm glad we did it: we were thinking about buying only for the 2 permanent (Future World and NASA), but for something like 2SGD more, we could see Escher's, which we had no idea what was about. This last one happened to be our favourite!Future World is great for kids. For us, it was fun, but not interesting.NASA was somehow a disappointment: it is small and we did not learn much (or nothing) from it...Escher's World of Wonder was a wonderful surprise, and we're glad we found it still open! It's about Escher's works and his perspective of the world, and how he has influenced it in many ways (CD covers, art, even movies and music videos). We did not know who he was and we've learned a lot about this interesting artist!"
We visited the Art Science Museum on a rainy day in Singapore which was a perfect indoor activity. The Museum had many intriguing interactive displays for people of all ages to enjoy.It did seem rather small compared to some similar museums I have been to.
Better to buy advanced tickets online to avoid long queues. Had to go through a long line to get to the Futureworld exhibition. Not much to see but a good place for photos.
Expected a bit more educational scientific approach. It's made for kids generally. But al in all not a big waste of time
"dont understand ............the concept of this ""museum"". some parts seem to be suitable for young kids, some parts for adults. for us the best was the werner herzog movie about the internet. free entrance. entrance fee's are much too high for what is offered.would not recommend this place."
"We visited the Future World, Escher's World of Wonder and NASA exhibits on sponsored tickets. Lots of kids in the museum. Be amazed by the artistic tessellation works of M.C. Escher. Having seen all the contents, don't think I will be interested for a revisit. Might not be value for money if you are not a fan of arts."
"Visited the ""Future World"" Exhibition. fun and interactive indoor activities for kids ranging 3 to 10. PS: their online booking system is so awkward and user unfriendly ..."
"While the tickets cost as if this were a world-class museum, the exhibition space is limited and the shows are fairly tame, both in concept and execution. There is an effort to provide hands on experience for children, but sometimes that's coloring or playing with balls. The Art-Science connection could be drawn more profoundly. Really, the excellence of this museum is the exterior."
Very small place and there are too few exhibitions. Ticket prices can be considered expensive and not value for money.
"Honesty, i had expected to see more of his master pieces. It was still okay and quite educational for the kids with the different activities available that they could learn from. They liked making their own music and playing it through the little machine. Some classic master pieces were there and I was happy t see them on display."
We did the Esther tour. We were told the future tour was more geared towards children.It took an hour. Was pleasant. Slow paced. Tickets cost about $12 as we got a discount being guests of the marina bay sands.Nice little gift room at the end. It was an ok experience.
Saw it all in two hours. Nothing spectacular. Visited it as part of the visit to Marina Bay Sands area.
"Love the lotus building, some great picture opportunities outside particularly with the lotus pond and reflecting mirror. But I've been disappointed with the exhibitions inside."
it was quite cool with the interactive screens but thats it..... might want to recommend gardens by the bay instead :)
"The ArtScience Museum, which was opened by Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, in 2011, has 6,000 square meters of space across 21 galleries.It features both permanent exhibitions, like Leonardo da Vinci's Flying Machine, and touring exhibitions.The futuristic building, designed by architect Moshie Safchie, is like an opening lotus flower."
Been there for 2nd time and I really like topic they show.My main problem is the customer nor really care the topic and are ther almost only for take there selfies in front of each projectionVery annoying I suggest to let phone and camera at th entrance for let people's really enjoy the tour and not just take a pics with out care what they see
We arrived early to a large queue. While pricey we chose the Future and Big Data electing to bypass the gem collection. Turns out the huge crowd was all families with young children. The Future is geared toward them with only two rooms that would please adults/teenagers (butterfly hologram room and Optic Fiber Jungle Light display).Big Data was quite stimulating and fun. We were in and enjoyed the whole exhibit to ourselves. The teens really enjoyed it stopping to read and explore everything.It was enjoyable but plan so you can skip peak crowds.
"I only went to the Future World exhibition that was said to be well suited for kids. I brought my 4.5-year old, excited about all the kids-friendly activities I had read about...However, the place is a little small, and when there are loads of children (as there was when I was there it being the last day of the school holidays), it can get a little overwhelming and I think that to accommodate so many children, some features had to be cut away, such as the self-design feature of the hopscotch, which was one of the original highlights of the exhibition...I think the staff was also overwhelmed and I find many of them, sadly, to be quite grouchy. Better trained staff who are more children-friendly and understanding might be better? They shushed the kids going down the slide and seemed to just be policing the area rather than helping guests to enjoy the experience. This is my first time there so it's just based on my one experience which might not be accurate...Other interesting activities include the colouring of vehicles/sea creatures which when scanned, go up onto the screen. While some activities are intuitive, not all are - like the dragon that comes out to be attacked by the aircraft - and I feel more instructions/engagement with staff could help. Another activity was the Table of Little Men, which was very interactive too. The colourful balls which my daughter pushed across with great excitement was also a highlight for her...Overall I spent about 2.5 hours there (out of which at least half an hour was spent going up and down the simple slide haha)...Don't think I could do much longer..."
"I was there last sunday and purchased the FutureWorld Tickets as i was told that there are alot of children activities in the museum.I was not disappointed as there are indeed many children activities - Slides, Drawing, Hopscotch, interactive games.The only downside is the museum should have a cafe for parents to sit down and relax while the kids play."
"The Arts Science Museum at the Marina Bay was something, although we didn't see the show, we were amazed by its structure, one to see."
Checked out the Future World exhibition at the Art Science museum near MBS today. Quite a few interesting activities for kids inside. It's a fairly small exhibition but surprisingly popular.
"I been on a Sunday noon time, I love the Exibition, verry interesting interaction set up and verry ludique.I not put high rate because one verry annoying thing is all peoples comme not for the Exibition but for only selfies and report to there friend. All phone on and flash on room suppose to be dark are annoying for me and all that person going to pose on front of he screen all the time.A nice plus will be to not allow any camera inside for force people to enjoy the moment more than just be here for show to the Froend !"
I went to the collider exhibition. I thought it was well set out and had a range of ways of presenting it which was good. I enjoyed it but wouldn't rave about it. If your into that sort of thing though then you would probably enjoy it more.
"This museum does not really have collections, they only have seasonal exhibitions.I went there to see the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a huge particle collider which was originally located in France-Switzerland. As someone who enjoys studying science I found this exhibition to be quite cool, and the videos were also cool. Being able to see actual parts of LHC meant a lot to me. If you're into Physics and Chemistry would definitely recommend visiting this exhibition.Plus I got free bottled vitamin water after the visit (which tasted a bit weird imo)"
"Was a little disappointed at how small the museum was on the inside. Very clean and friendly staff but not impressed with our visit, becausexwecwere expecting more."
"A museum that seems to comprise mostly a series of special exhibitions rather than scientific exhibits as I expected. However the displays on Nobel were very informative and made great use of interactive video to allow you to explore aspects of his life and legacy.The Hadron Collider showed in detail what has been built there and why, and again made good use of imaginative videos, mock-ups and actual parts to allow you to believe you have actually been there and met some of the staff. One bonus is excellent free-access wifi!"
"We had walked across the Helix bridge and were walking around the Marina Bay shopping centre across the road from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel trying to get some good photos of the Hotel and the Oberon Lion Fountain as saw a sign about the latest show. Now parts of the building have free access and stunning views while the special show required payment to enter.What is interesting is the role that this building plays in the light and sound show at night as this is the ""CUP"" and plays a role. See review of light show for further info and places to watch from.The Art building contains a number of hands on exhibitions several are stunning as well as Art from local artists. The way the building winds around and operates on the different wings and levels is brilliant. You can walk around and challenge yourself to get to all the nooks and exhibition areas.As with so much of Singapore it is a stones throw from the City centre, Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Hotel and more. The hop on hop off bus stops nearby but take the time to walk the Helix Bridge which is located next to this centre. Staff are friendly and able to address many languages and questions.The thing is that you can take your time and spend several hours or visit a couple of times and take it all in."
"Was there for the Large Hadron Collider Exhibition which was ran concurrently with Nobel Prize exhibition. The ticketed LHC exhibition was OK.. was expecting a bit more. There was slightly more emphasis on the recent achievements of the LHC is discovering the Higgs Boson particle. It's a very very technical and scientific exhibit. Rather fitting to the theme and name of the museum but as it dealt with rather advance physics, it might not be very engaging to visitors who might not have prior knowledge on the science behind it.. It does help if there were some guided tour..."
exhibits too few and place too small and not that interesting unless there is a specific exhibit specifically brought by the museum. better to spend time admiring LV special boutique and the many shops in the MBS Shoppes. not for real museum lovers thought the lotus flower designed museum is impressive externally.
We attended the Deep marine exhibition which was interesting and the Singapore Stories. The building is really interesting although it is actually quite cold and spartan inside.
"If it wasn't for the Dreamworks exhibit I wouldn't have bothered paying for entrance, which is quite pricey for a relatively small museum. The museum's exterior is one of it's highlights though and you can witness that for free! ;)"
"I battled my way walking to the Marina Bay from my hotel during a freak thunderstorm and heavy down pour determined to visit this museum, you can also access by metro and I think the buses stop here aswell. And kinda struggled to fill my time if I'm honest. I paid $30 SG for entry into The Deep and Dreamworks exhibits; personally by UK standards I don't think that's very expensive, but can see how it would be if you're travelling with a family.I loved The Deep and spent over an hour wandering through the exhibit, I found the Dreamworks exhibit over quite quickly and the rest of the museum much smaller in comparison and nothing else here seemed to grab my attention. Maybe I had just over estimated how much time I could realistically potter about in here for. I think the Dreamworks exhibit was more enjoyed by the children I saw there and the layout didn't really appeal to me, having to drag out the 40mins I spent looking around and messing with interactive drawing computers. I much preferred The Deep exhibit and loved dawdling around in the dark looking at all the scary dead fish (but that probably says more about me as a person). I probably should have just paid the cheaper entry fee for this exhibit but I had time to kill and might not have gotten my voucher for a free drink if I had done that.The Singapore stories exhibit added some local cultural and historical knowledge but by this time I was a losing attention span, and the 4th floor holds information on design inspiration for the architecture of the building which is pretty cool,but these are much smaller feeling areas. Overall all the different parts of the museum had their own unique appeal and interactive learning activities, but I struggled to fill a few hours here nevermind an afternoon, or try and make this an all day event. But it did eventually stop raining!"
"Singapore has so many fantastic museums that I guess I had high expectations, and I was disappointed. I saw Dreamworks, the Deep and Singapore Stories. They were all interesting enough, but there just wasn't very much there. On the other hand, I had seen similar exhibits before at other places. For tourists, I'd recommend the Asian Civilisations Museum, or Gardens by the Bay for a better value for your money."
The ticket buying process was very tedious with a long queue due to a system breakdown and insufficient number of staff while I was visiting. The entry tickets are quite costly and I recommend to get a Marina Bay Sands membership card to receive a discount.The DreamWorks exhibition was absolutely wonderful with very interesting exhibits and facts.
Went into the Deep exibition and it was very pricey I thought but enjoyed all the information and pictures. The top part of the museum wasn't worth the look but it was the end of the day and was my 5th museum so could have been just me
"Having discovered this place through my research, I had pretty much decided that this was one of the places that I was going to visit while in Singapore. The thing is that with many of these museums you need to time yourself properly otherwise you won't find any exhibitions here of any interest. This was the case when I visited, namely because I wanted something uniquely Singaporean as opposed to something that might (or might not) land up in a museum in Australia (or elsewhere). However they did have one interesting exhibit, and that was the history of Singapore as told by its major newspaper, the Straights Time. It was quite an interesting half-an-hour, however the other two exhibitions really held no interest for me."
"Opened in February 2011, in a uniquely lotus shaped building with ten skyward extension, it either look like a pair of cupped hands or a blossoming lotus flower.The ArtScience Museum is part of the entire Marina Bay Sands complex in Singapore and the building itself have become as iconic as the '3 legged' MBS hotel behind.Privately owned and operated by MBS, the museum celebrates creativity at Its best through art, science, design, media, architecture and technology.With 1 permanent exhibition on the above, the other 3 galleries are for touring exhibition.At my time of visit, it was Singapore Then and Now, Dreamworks Animation and The Deep.Singapore Then and Now is set up by Singapore Press Holdings, the folks who have been printing our newspapers since then 1845. This exhibition is a highlights of key events in Singapore's history through an array of news headlines and news clippings. It is part of the Singapore Golden Jubilee Celebration.The most enjoyable visit for me is to Dreamworks Animation exhibition. It is great to see up close the design process, props, storyboards, art works of some of our favorite characters up close.The Deep is the other exhibition that I enjoyed. Lost of deep sea creatures and specimens on display.Overall, in my humble opinion, a visit to this museum really depends on what exhibition is showing and if it really peak your interest, otherwise, it will be a hefty price to pay just to visit this place."
"When I went there was an exhibition about Dreamworks animated movies and one about Deep Sea.The Dreamworks one was disappointing as I was hoping for information about the animation technology but it was mostly just pictures of the different characters. Probably best for small children who know the movies well.The Deep Sea one was more interesting. If it was less crowded and there were fewer people with stupid selfie sticks taking pictures of themselves for 20mins in front of each exhibit the experience may have been more enjoyable. It amazes me at the beautiful and interesting places people go to and all they want to do is take pictures of themselves. Anyway, the exhibit did have lots of interesting information and is worth an hour of your time."
"We visited here in July 2015. I had expected very little from this iconic ""hand-shaped"" or ""lotus flower shaped"" museum, but ""Wow!"" I was pleasantly surprised. Exiting the Marina Bay Shoppes and walking outdoors to enter the museum, I noticed the clever design of the museum, which gave the perception of openness while the tall, overhanging ""bowl shape"" of the Museum actually protected you from rain (it was raining heavily when we went). The lotus pond with bright purple blooms leading up to the entrance can't be missed either. Perhaps the only pitfall of the museum's design was the upper floors that make up the ""flower"" has very little functional space for exhibits. The larger temporary exhibits, definitely the main draw of the museum, is actually underground and not really part of the museum's iconic ""shape"".As with many Singapore attractions, residents & citizens get a discount on tickets. Definitely get the ""full"" ticket which allows you to tour the temporary exhibitions (when we visited, a deep sea and Dreamworks animation exhibit) as well as the dismal ""ArtScience Galeries"" upstairs (more on that later).I was definitely amazed at ""The Deep"" exhibit (one of the temporary exhibits), which showcased a variety of deep sea specimens and their unique environmental adaptions to the hostile life in the ocean depths. First of all, the galleries were dark, quiet, and peaceful, allowing you to really (pardon the pun) ""immerse"" yourself in the ocean depths that these unique creatures live in. While there were others visiting, they were nowhere near as noisy as the patrons at...other museums...helping to really set a nice ""vibe"". The darkness of the rooms, while meant to evoke the depths of the ocean, may be an issue if you've been in the sun all day: my dad bumped into a wall, thinking it was a path. The specimens themselves (stored in glass cases) range from the ""typical"" anglerfish and orange roughy to the bizarre: ""glass ball"" creatures (best way I can describe them), transparent shrimp, and much more. But what perhaps impressed me the most was the detail they went to describing each and every specimen: at least a paragraph or more for each one. For someone who appreciates scientific information and interesting details, I really enjoyed the exhibit and afterwards, my appreciation for the deep ocean really grew. Some the specimens can be rather grotesque, as is with many deep-sea animals; it may not be advisable to bring young children to this exhibit.The other temporary exhibit was a Dreamworks animation gallery, where you could tour through the process animators go through to design their countless animated movies. Fans of Kung Fu Panda, How to Train You Dragon, Madagascar, Shrek, etc. will enjoy the items on display, which include many scale models of characters & buildings used by the animators. There were also computer displays where you could try your hand at animation or experiment with various CGI effects (which I enjoyed). I never really grew up with these films, so it was hard for me to really say ""Wow!"" over this exhibit. But still, a very impressive display, and perfect for the whole family.Perhaps the only let-down was when we visited the ""ArtScience Galleries"", which are actually inside the ""flower"" of the museum. First of all, it was empty, save for the janitor and one other family. There wasn't really anymore than a short film about ""invention"" and ""innovation"" and that sort of thing (it wasn't even that memorable), and an unimpressive display about well-known inventions and their history. It seemed part of these galleries were closed off for renovation...but still! A very underwhelming end to our visit. At the ticket counter, be sure your ticket includes access to the temporary exhibits--otherwise you will be very disappointed.All in all, this place was a pleasant surprise, which I find is very rare for a ""new"" Singapore attraction. Obviously this review will become obsolete after new temporary exhibits are installed, but we had a fabulous experience here and would love to visit again--can't wait to see what they have next!"
"A treat for an animator student or kids who love to know about animations and how its done.....beautifully done, activity for kids to make thir own flip book, flightbof dragon a wonderful short moie clip experience. Story board writing, expressions drawing and sketches....very neat. We did not viit deep as the live aquarium was better....the gllery dsplay only or enthusiast."
"The ArtScience in Singapur was mostly interesting in form of its architecture. I found the shows ( The Deep / Dreamworks ) both not overly exciting and the permanent contemporary art a little to less.The concept in that way was not very convincing as none of the shows had the depth you would expect but all were more for quick entertainment than anything else.Still a fascinating building and nice if you want to get away from the ""bling-bling"" crowd in the mall."
"Whenever it comes to contemporary art it would automatically mean an IG spot, but the one hosted by teamlab(future world) turned into a children playground instead. Kids running everywhere, screaming, it's like a zoo rather than an art museum.I bought a pass for 2 exhibition, skipping the wonderland one, for SG32, it was not worth it for its display and the atmosphere.The floating utopia was alright nothing major."
"It was very disappointing to pay almost $40 for my husband and I to get into the exhibition called 'Future World' and discover that most of what they have there is evidently for kids - colorouring books, a slide, big colorful inflated balloons/balls to jump on, etc.I asked a person who works at the ticketing center for advice - whether it is a good choice to specifically get into this exhibition, and she said it was the best option. Clearly she saw we were a couple of adults with no children around us, so I wish she helped me pick a better option for the two of us.'Crystal universe' installation at the end is beautiful (that's the picture they have on a poster) but is not even enjoyable to walk through as you have to wait in a queue for a very long time as people in front take their sweet time to snap a million photos. That space should be better organizied and maybe controlled with respect towards all people who'd like to enjoy it. It looks fantastic on photos and promotional videos - but you certainly won't have that experience when you are there...When at the exit I asked if they would allow us to see another exhibition (explaining the situation, that I asked for help and was recommended to go to the kids interactive exhibition) all I received was a shoulder shrug and told to go to visitors center and 'maybe they will help me, I am not sure' (quoting)."
I can not understand why this is a permanent exhibition at the Artsience Museum unless there were unused space and the owners needed to earn some revenue for it!The facts on the wall posters were somewhat interesting but the items on exhibition were really bad and uninteresteni. Looked like some oversized blow-up dolls. Only the big balloon that looked like the moon was worth looking at...the rest pretty uninteresting.
"Got the all access tickets...but got confused on the timing specified on the ticket. I assume it was for the Alice in wonderland...but i need to make sure with someone. I asked 4 people, and they dont have any clue and ask me to go to the ticketing office. Those staff i approached are manning the exhibits, which i assume...they should know what tickets are they accepting.Anywy, we went ahead with my assumption and proceed with Alice first. Then we wento for lunch, and went back for Future and Utopia.Alice in wonderland is ok if u have little kids in tow. But the tea party, very unfriendly staff (guy). Maybe the guy assumes everyone knows the rules. Tsk tsk, he even argued to one tourist. He is askng for 4 more people to take seats, the foreigner group is 3, so basically she can. But its like he shooed them away, until the girl argued...then they were able to take the seats.Future world is ok, the last part... staff always makes you to walk and do not just stand...how can people take their photo???! And of course people will understand the queue, everyone wants good photo.Floating Utopia- you can skip this."
"I went there for the future world exhibition with a friend. The staff was a bit unfriendly in the string lights room. The staff at the entrance asked us to rudely to put our bags in front of us so our bags wont hit any of the lights, which is understandable but the attitude really made us feel unwelcoming. They kept asking us to move forward even though it was quite empty. We just wanted to appreciate the different shades of lighting. Also the passage way was a bit narrow so our backs accidentally touched the string light once but we already immediately walked off, the staff rushed to us and told us off impolitely. We really felt like we were in military school and kept getting told where to go and when to move. You could really feel the staff did not want you to stay there even though there was barely anyone."
"There is a lot of hype that has been built about this place. There is nothing really experiential here. A lot of optics and very little content. It is more like an amusement place for kids (and a very expensive one!).At the end, we were left wondering what this was all about - it was neither an experience center, nor a museum in the true sense. We felt very disappointed.Even my 9 year old was not impressed!"
"We visited only Future World exhibition, which is quite interesting for younger kids who can play there and draw various objects, people and animals, scan them and then they appear live and moving on the screen. However not worth a visit if you don't come with kids."
"The entire exhibition took us 24 min to experience. This is not a artmuseum, this is an expensive playground/kindergarten. Everything is made for kids, great if you are a family- terrible if you're not.Great if you have kids age 1-11. We couldnt interact or appriciate anything because of the hundreds of kids screaming, running and falling in front of you. The noice was so loud that We left.And the crystal universe- it is about 5m long and staff rush you through it so you cant stay more than 1,5 minute.Worst spending in Singapore. The Spectra watershow is a 100 Times more touching and artistic than this dark playground."
"This was overpriced and of poor quality, a young fan would find this very boring.I just wish we read the reviews beforehand, this whole thing took us less than 20 mins to look around. Then when you got to the shop the place was half empty."
"Was very excited to come here, but was soon let down as we were told that 60% of the main exhibition was closed.We bought tickets for the Marvel Studio Exhibition instead which was embarrassing. It had lots of information and reported all the movies and their release dates...but i could have found that on wikipedia.The statues and displays were very cringeworthy and poorly made. The whole experience was very overpriced for very little to show for it.However, the ArtScience Museum is a gorgeous building, especially at night when it is lit up in front of the Marina Bay Sands"
"This building looks amazing but sadly that's where it ends, the current exhibitions looked fun and exciting but after paying almost $70 for a couple we found it to be boring and lacking in any substance. The Marvel thing was basically a commercial for the Avengers infinity war and was a complete waste of time and money. It would be ok for kids but save your money and walk along the lovely waterfront."
"For a 10 year Marvel Studio exhibition this was very poor and a complete waste of money and time. To showcase the movies and its main characters you'd expect at least various movie props, costumes, set pieces, etc but nothing like it. It's a very short meander past plaster versions of the main characters and very little explanation of their universe along side it. We were expecting something like the Harry Potter exhibition that was here some years ago and where you could really relive the movies. Even if it had half the experience of Harry Potter it would've been worth it but this was terrible and hopefully not an indication of future ArtScience exhibitions.The stitched together trailer of several Marvel movies at the end in a special ""theatre"" room really said it all."
Beautiful exterior. Amazing architecturally. Saw two exhibits. Too small and quick for the money. Each took about 15-20 minutes. $68 for family of 4 to see Wind Walkers and Marvel
"if u and your children aren't marvel fans, entering this museum is totally disappointing. there are just statues of heroes and stuffs and the show is quite boring. no spiderman and no captain america statue. definitely is not worth it for $19 (adult price, saturday) . the only massive statue and good one is the iron man one."
"First of all, the Singaporen lady at the ticketing counter is rude and arrogant and kind of ruined the whole trip.Secondly, make sure you have Sands Rewards member so you will not be overcharged for the exhibitions.Lastly, the exhibitions targeted for young children so make sure you understand that before buying tickets."
"Maybe our expectations were too high, but the ticket includes too little for it's price. We took the Future world exhibition, which was in my opinion mainly for kids till 12 age."
We paid the senior price of S$26 to enter this haven of Art and Science. The exhibits from London well worth viewing but the rest was the normal graffiti rubbish that you can see everywhere.I cannot recommend: this place to anyone it is a bit of a rip off and Singapore should be ashamed for allowing it to be put in place.We wasted our money!
"It was OK, with fantastic design, yet the staff were not that friendly, I would suggest they spread more smile to guests. I bought the all package ticket, it was a little overrated, I went to Science Museum in London, it's way better and free. However, good location for sure and nice coffee shop!!"
My Visit was worthy to see the Museum. Great experience to go through the things and have learned more things about Singapore in details.
We've enjoyed many exhibitions at the ACM. Recommend checking online for details and any deals. Gorgeous building to enjoy too. Usually we eat at Prive cafe there as well. Then walk aloong the tiver outside.
"This museum is a wonderful place to lose half a day easily and I did!Great, well run museum with excellent staff. The whole experience was educational, informative and fascinating. Loved it and will return one day."
"The name Singapore derives from Singa Pura or ""Lion City"". Singapore has flourished because it has always been open to the world. This is one of the best museums I have seen in Asia, and I have seen many. The museum buidling was formerly the offfices of the British colonial administration. The building has been wonderfully restored, housing a fine collection of exhibits from all over Asia. If you are staying in Singapore, this is a ""must see."" By the way, it is doubtful if there were any lions in Singapore, but there were many tigers in the early days."
"Such variety, in such a well laid out museum. The Asian Civilisations Museum (ACM) by the river, in Singapore, is just sensational. When we visited, historical exhibits with a key focus on; academic, maritime, movie-making and religious developments as well as events, were prominent. Compact, accessible and in a superb riverside location, I feel it is an easy decision to choose to explore the ACM while on tour in Singapore."
"Great way to see the early history of the city. The trading, history, art and the effects of the various cultures on the development of Singapore. Additionally, great overview of regional Asian history."
"This is not a museum to go through quickly. Similar to Smithsonian in Washington DC, there is a LOT to see and read about. The staff are helpful and the flow is very logical."
This museum is well worth spending a few hours browsing through. It does put the heritage of Singapore into perspective with some incredible exhibits.
"A very interesting museum full of Asian Art, culture and the heritage of Asia. Some of it over 500 years old! There are different rooms representing different arts. Current exhibit was Living with Ink. Fascinating articles from an old shipwreck. An interesting walk through with a hands on exhibit and gift shop at the end."
"Interesting place with many exhibitions, great for taking photos.Many people come here to take wedding photos etc."
"The Asian Civilisations Museum is meant to showcase the rich art and culture of not only Singapore, but also the SE Asian region. The building itself is lovely and has a strong presence, even though tranquil. The Khoo Teck Puat Gallery is an exhibit for the cargo recovered from the Tang Shipwreck, a sunken 9th century trading ship and gives an excellent overview of porcelain and other ceramics. Upstairs galleries house religious statues and idols of worship. This place is easily accessible from Raffles Place and City Hall MRT Stations. The permanent galleries are free for citizens and permanent residents. I would recommend a minimum of two hours here! A cafe and toilet facilities can be found here."
"I have always been fascinated by such museums, and this did not disappoint at all. Tracking the history of all of Asia down centuries with artefacts, I felt I was part of the centuries long evolution.Must visit and budget 2-3 hours.The museum staff were very kind to tell me that I was visiting an hour before museum closing but i didnt have a choice."
Excellent variety of ethnic historical items to showcase the diversity of Singapore.The Ink exhibition was a wonderful bonus with a beautiful display of a variety of traditional and contemporary paintings.The friendly coffee shop offers welcome refreshments and there is also a restaurant and gift shop.
Whenever I am going to Singapore I always check to see if there are any new exhibitions at this museum. I have seen several very interesting and varied exhibitions over the last year. I am never disappointed when visiting here. The Asian anthropological exhibits and the Tang Shipwreck are also very interesting. I can spend hours here looking and the wide range of artefacts available. It is definitely worth visiting and is a very short walk from Raffles MRT Station. I have also had lunch here several times as well. This has also been a very enjoyable experience and a nice way to finish off seeing the exhibitions.
"This is an interesting museum showcasing art and artifacts from all over Asia, including ceramics, furniture, and textiles. The second floor has rooms dedicated to religious items from Buddhism, Christianity and Islam. It is well organized with all the signage in English. It's the perfect size, and while we were there we got to do some fun arts and crafts. Recommended if you're looking for an interesting way to spend a morning."
"This museum has many wonderful things, but the cargo of the 1,000-year-old Tang Shipwreck found in 1998 exhibited on the main floor is truly amazing. It is one of the best things in all of Singapore."
This is an interesting museum. Not only do you find Buddhist or Hindi artifacts but everything related to Asia and South East Asia. The big exhibition with the findings of an old merchant ship off the coast of Indonesia is beautiful.This is a MUST go when in Singapore
"We came here on 2 January. We were not sure if the museum was open or not. But open! First we entered the wrecked ship part. It was really interesting to know the sea lane to link the east and west even hundreds of years ago. At he same time we could get chances to know Asian civilization. Though this may not be regarded as the spot for tourists, I believe worth visiting for tourists as well. In addition we got kind guidance from a volunteer although she was off officially. It was really kind of her."
We loved this museum because of our private interest in early pottery & porcelain so we thought the Tang Shipwreck exhibition was superb. The early Chinese and Japanese porcelain was also very fine. The Hong Bowl & the Famille Rose period Fish Bowl were stunning.
"A very pleasant and sunny, bright museum, with BEAUTIFUL collections to get acquainted with the history of the asian civilisations. We spend three hours here and were really enchanted."
"I've noticed that the museums in Singapore are housed in historical staid colonial style government buildings that provide utter surprise when you visit. The National Gallery, National Museum and the Asian Civilisations Museum, we visited on three afternoons and each one provided us with wonderful exposure to cultural and historical treasures. Though we had a scant 1.5 hours at the ACM, we spent time visiting the Shipwreck which was on display in NYC several years ago. Here we saw the full exhibit and I would easily go back to just spend more time in these galleries. The heart and the soul of the museum is the Works of Ink, a private collection that is among the best collections in the world, maybe outside of China."
Lots to see without being overwhelmed. The galleries were well designed and displayed. We learnt a lot and were really impressed with the collections.
An interesting and surprisingly large collection of artifacts. The temporary exhibition on Chinese ink painting and calligraphy showcases the works of great painters and calligraphers.
"This is what you could call a 'proper' museum: full of fascinating objects, arranged to tell stories, intelligently displayed in context and properly captioned and designed to illuminate and educate rather than 'entertain;' though, by illuminating and educating, it also entertains. One could tag on to a free guided tour or just go where the flow takes one. Subjects covered included the development of religions in the area and the history of Singapore and surrounding area in the time before Raffles turned up.The artefacts from the Tang Dynasty shipwreck were impressive by their numbers and quality. The shipwreck was not exactly in Singapore's waters but showed the extent of the trade that came through the area back in the day. The Scholars gallery, devoted to the Chinese ideal of 'the Scholar' showed items of exquisite quality. We visited at the time of the 'Living with Ink' exhibition which displayed a superb collection of Chinese scripts and paintings.We spent an afternoon there and should have found time for a return visit, but didn't. Next time."
A fascinating and huge place. A whole day here would not be wasted. The permanent collections and temporary exhibits are well presented and accompanied by explanatory maps and texts making the whole experience more meaningful. Pictures are allowed.
They a have an abnormally comprehensive display that is well lit and designed. There are also great restaurant choices.
"I walked past this place on my way to Marina Bay and got curious. I was not disappointed! The shipwreck exhibition is fascinating, as is the one of ink paintings. I also enjoyed the history of religion in Singapore and the trade in Singapore. There was a free guided tour with a museum volunteer, who was just so delightfully, endearingly enthusiastic about everything. Really great visit, would wholeheartedly recommend."
"I have seen plenty of museums over the world, but this is among the most interesting and best kept I have visited. The collection of pieces from the region in impressive. I particularly enjoyed the collection of pieces recovered in 1998 from the Tang shipwreck.Highly recommended."
"I visited the Asian Civilisations Museum in October 2019. I paid a reduced ticket price of $4 SGD. There is a lot to see in this museum. Porcelain from the Tang Dynasty, artifacts from shipwrecks, paintings of China (Xiamen, Macau, Guangzhou, Shanghai Bund, Hong Kong), Asian furniture, statues, buddhas. There are also sections on Islamic Art, Chinese Art, art from Indonesia and the Philippines, Malaysian Art, India and many others. The museum is overwhelming if you want to study everything. There is also a gift shop."
I have a great interest in Buddhism and this museum has a wonderful collection. Well worth a visit. There are also exhibits on other religions that are present in Singapore and information about how they were originally transmitted. It is a very cool and peaceful place to while away a couple of hours and there is a nice restaurant next door. I walked there along the river from my hotel.
its very nice specially the garden outside. The museum has singapore history and very antique items. One must visit if he wants to know how singapore developed.
"Visited this place with 2 kids on stroller, it was pleasant as family group visit.For foreigners, need to pay SGD8 for 1 adult tickets. Museum was open on weekends too. Pretty good collection they have especially the Tang Shipwreck collection.Outside the museum is a small park and a river crossing. Kids can play around it too. Saw families on bikes too. Just a walking distance from this museum,around 5 minutes, you can get to Merlion Statue. convinient!"
"This museum was fascinating, especially the masks and weapons on the second floor, I really enjoyed reading the information provided alongside the interesting items.It's cheap to enter and you could easily spend a couple of hours here, highly recommended!"
"Spent a few hours here and not nearly enough, the collection is great as are the stories around each item. Lovely museum!"
"walking in the history of this British colonial building , let you feel the grandeur of the time.exploring Asia's artistic heritage."
Usually pay a visit on each trip since 2011. Well set out. Makes you want to visit more of SouthEast Asia when you see the artefacts. Excellent Cambodia Angkor Wat exhibition last year. Pity they removed the charming little video talks on the walls of rooms. Tap to wake the speaker!
Easily accessible and reasonably priced with an extensive collection of a spectacular cross section of Asian artwork. A quiet space that is really well organized with lots of informative brochures. A fun place to wander and learn about centuries of amazing artwork.
"What an excellent museum, it went through the main Asian civilisations and had examples of their art, pottery and life. The curator must be proud of the way the displays were set up and how informative they were. The Tang shipwreck was a highlight as well as everything on the second story, even the booklets were high quality and informative, I had to donate extra as I pinched some to take home. Best museum in Singapore."
"My 10 year old girl did not want to leave, so we had lunch in the museum's exceptional cafe and did the floors again. As a San Franciscan, I know Asian art. This eclectic collection is on stellar display. Lunch and artefacts from the depths of the sea through the sands of time! The best."
ACM is one of the cultural museums in Singapore where one can immerse steeply into the historical culture from both local and regional countries.
There are not many museums that focus on Asian Civilizations so this makes it a must visit place. There is a lot to see and do so expect to spend atleast 1 to 2 hours and take a free docent tour. After that visit the pretty museum Cafe where you can also sit outdoor on the deck overlooking the Singapore River and high-rises of the downtown district
"If you only have a short time in Singapore, this museum is well worth seeing, it's one of the best museums in Asia. It catalogues the evolution of Asian civilsation and religions. The museum is in the imposing Empress Place building, built in 1865 by Indian convicts. It was once the headquaters of the British colonial administation. It's a tad surprising that Singapore lives so well with its heritage of diverse Asian cultures, this museum helps explains why.. I would put this on my ""don't miss"" list."
This Museum provided me with insight as to how the four major religions evolved in Singapore - I very much want to back there.
"We really enjoyed this museum, not only because it's nice and cool inside with the AC running full blast but you learn so much about the history and culture, especially all of the religions that shaped this region.Only bad thing was the day we went was the last day for a big exhibit of gowns and dresses by a famous Chinese fashion designer. We really were not as interested in seeing that exhibit but it made for a very long line of people buying tickets. Took almost an hour to work up to pay for ours.We felt the displays of art and statues inside and the lighting were really the best we have seen in a long time. The descriptions were very well written."
The Asian Civilisations Museum is a must for all visitors. The permanent displays and special exhibitions are always excellent. This is one of the world's premier museums. I especially recommend the Tang Shipwreck and the ceramics collection. I visit the museum every time I go to Singapore. (and the restaurant is excellent)
My surprise at finding that the entrance fee was $8 (not $4) was quickly covered with other emotions. A great exhibition of many of the civilisations close to Singapore. Loved the art - And the balanced presentation of various religions & their art.
Such an interesting place - loved the 'Trade' section. Helped explain Singapore's historical and geographical importance.Beautiful artefacts from so many religions on display.
"Brandon Chia's two hour guided tour of the Asian Civilization Museum brought the history of the Chinese experience in Singapore to life. The museum is a treasure trove with many fascinating artifacts, which Brandon's exceptional tour connected in a meaningful way.Spend the extra money for the guided tour as opposed to the audio and you won't be sorry. Tour included tickets for tea and an egg custard pastry at a nearby bakery."
A real eye-opener as to the many different cultures and their offerings to civilisations over the yearsWorth a visit
"This museum is not the largest, but it is a very manageable size. We saw an exhibit about trade throughout Asia that was fantastic and really helped us learn about the geography and history of this region. We were also lucky enough to stumble upon an exhibit by fashion designer Guo Pei that was mind blowing. There are also many rooms filled with Asian artifacts. Most rooms were dark and cool, allowing for peaceful meandering."
Take the free tour it is very informative.The Tang Shipwreck is worth seeing.The Guo Pei Exhibition was amazing.To much to see in a few hours would need a couple of visists.
Beautiful museum. So much to see in each section. Learning about all the different religious arts. The Asian fashion was jaw dropping. We spent a lot of time here and enjoyed every moment.
"This is a really nice place to visit if you are in the area. There is a lot to cover with displays covering Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Islam in the region."
A very old and historical museum with a very appealing architecture. Was sitting outside and admiring it. Good to stop and smell the flowers as office is nearby.
It's a wonderful place to learn about the Asian cultures over the centuries. I really ennjoyed the exibishions. Although it is located in the heart of the city it is not overrun with the tourist.
This museum features wonderful history of the trade of East and Southeast Asia. It has a terrific collection of ceramics and uses that as an anchor to retell the story of Asia.The current special exhibition of Guo Pei is amazing as well. The museum really emphasizes arts and crafts and their place in history.I think it's very well curated. I was able to take a tour and it was well done as well. The staff are helpful and professional. It's a lovely building. It's not too large or too small. It's one of my favourite museum experiences ever to be honest. Great job!
"Greatly surprised by this museum. Beautiful exhibits, well displayed and hardly anyone there. Ceramics from shipwreck were amazing."
A really great way to better understand Singapore and the region. As great now as it has ever been. Great place
"Drop by if you're in the Raffles Place area, especially on a hot day for the air-conditioned comfort. It's an interesting place, but I was on a free tour so I cannot comment on the costs for tourists."
Very impressive display of delicate workmanship and nicely intertwined with antiques from the ACM collection !
"This is a must see museum. Huge exhibition of different Asian cultures and religions that is both fascinating and educational. Do take time out to visit - it is well worth it.Congratulations to the curator for a well set out,designed and most importantly, well lit exhibitions I have seen for a while."
Seen is better than read. We can see and feel the displays telling us the years of culture plus civilization in Asian past. Worth all the time spent in the museum for understanding or better than reading the Asian civilization. It will be an extra incentive if your just in time to see more of your history as there are always the museum to show as many as possible of the Asian artifacts.
"This museum was not in my plan for the day but how lucky that I ventured in. The exhibits were fabulous, really interesting and unique. Absolutely loved it, spent over 2 hours there and could probably have done more but ran out of time. Museum tours are free and very informative. Well worth the visit."
Collections cover all major religions/cultures in Asia with interesting stories about how the religions were spread across the countries (e.g Christian in China). Great place for kids and adults! My adult friend even spent more than 3 hours during the visit!
This museum should be a must-have for a visit in Singapore.It has a quite good mixture of artefacs and information and helps you to understand the ideas behind the singaporeans politic.And it shows the connections between the asean countries during the centuries.A visit to that museum should be a must on a stay in Singapore.
This was a lovely morning activity for the family. The museum houses a large collection of pottery but also ornate pieces from the many different civilizations that occupy this region. Make sure you visit all the rooms. Each has pieces more interesting than the other.
"There is excellent variety in the exhibits and even if you are not the museum going type (which I am not), you will still be able to find something that interests you."
We spent 3 hours in the museum. The collection of artifacts is simply amazing. I will suggest go slow to enjoy the collection.
"Excellent museum, they do free guided tours, good idea to get one of these first and explore independently afterwards"
Take the time to visit the Asian Civilisations Museum. It is very large and well done with a variety of exhibits.
"The Asian Civilisations Museum may be a bit tiny, but it's a place definitely worth to check out ! It is well-guided and the explanations are very clear and interesting, and there's a free paper gallery guide which sums up it all. My personal favourite was the ""Tang Wreckship"" part, first floor. Worth noting that in the ""Arabic Art"" section, there's a free children book about southeast asia.(Free for Singaporian, 4S$ Foreign Student, Handiccaped, Senior 8 s$ full price)"
Really great presentation of the Angar Wat history and artifacts. Went with 17yo son who was not as impressed but very enjoyable if this is your type of attraction. Wasn't too dear.
"The Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM), located near Clarke Quay, is dedicated to exploring the rich artistic heritage of Asia and gives great insight into life before the 20th century. It highlights Singapore's history as a port city and provides informative exhibits that will change your perspective of people, places, and processes. I did 2 different tours of the ACM. The first one was about Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles and his time in Java, and the second was about the Tang Shipwreck.Sir Stamford Raffles is known as the founder of Singapore. There are schools, roads, and various monuments named after him. But who was he really? According to our volunteer docent, 'Raffles is a man of many monikers; scholar, scoundrel, administrator, plagiarizer, reformer, statesman.' This tour gives a peek into the life of Raffles from different perspectives. It details his thoughts, feelings, and mindset through his collection of art. Most Singaporeans remember Raffles due to his brief 10-month stay in Singapore but in reality, he rose to prominence during his residence is Java, Indonesia. The story of this man has been interpreted and misinterpreted hundreds of times. This tour also described the great empires of Java and the intricate relationship between Britain and its colonies. Additionally, displayed at the museum are several collections of art, trinkets, masks, puppets, gamelan ensemble, and more by Raffles. As a Singaporean Resident, this tour gave me a new understanding of the man who is so cherished by locals and foreigners alike.In 1998, a shipwreck discovered near Sumatra islands, south of Singapore, was found to contain a remarkable cargo of ceramics, gold and silver objects. The story started about 1100 years ago, during the time of the Tang dynasty in China. Trade was flourishing between China, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The objects recovered show us the strong demand for rare objects, and the artistic skills possessed by craftsmen back then. This gallery, with its stunning artifacts and displays, tells a story of lost civilizations.There were also some interesting quotes by the guides at the museum:'Raffles is a man of many monikers; scholar, scoundrel, administrator, plagiarizer, reformer, statesman.''The Tang Shipwreck helps us understand arguably the most important period of human history, the time of the trade.'"
"If you have time for only one museum, make it this one. The story of SE Asia is told through the incredible collection of artifacts on display, including the spectacular Tang shipwreck ceramics from the C8&9th. They do great tours in different languages, the docents are very well informed. If you live in Singapore, join the Friends of the Museums and come to their regular Monday morning lecture series or Friday with Friends lectures held on friday evenings. They have speakers who are passionate about their subjects."
"Being from Canada I wanted to get a better/clearer idea of different Asian cultures through art, artifacts and religious items. The well laid out 3 floors of this museum did exactly that. My wife and I were there for better part of 4 hours (can be done much quicker if you choose), what we saw was breathtaking and helped me understand regions/cultures/religions and their impact."
"This beautiful and well laid out museum is a must see if you're in the area. The displays are well lit, with good descriptions in English. The museum is uncluttered yet full of fabulous antiquities from all around Asia that are beautifully displayed. The Tang shipwreck display was one of my favorite areas with thousands of porcelain bowls pulled from the bottom of the sea, displayed as ocean waves. Lovely. We spent about an hour and a half there but one could easily spend three hours and never be bored. Nice museum shop."
We had a terrific guide and learned so many interesting things about all of Asia. We were completing a four-week tour of Southeast Asia. Enjoyed lunch in their restaurant sitting on the terrace overlooking the Singapore River. Chose two Singapore specialties - chicken curry and crab chili spaghetti - both very tasty.
"In addition to a vast array of exhibits and display information normally available at this grand river side location, there is a very well laid out special exhibition called "" Raffles in Southeast Asia -revisiting the Scholar and Statesmen. This special exhibition costs $20 per adult and includes an hourly free and very informative guided tour. A must for all history Buffs in this special bi centenary year."
"If you only have one museum to visit - make this one, the one! Great curated collection, it is intimate, ambience is beautiful and it's not overwhelming. Great cafe nearby too - and it is not touristy or a playground with lots of school trip events."
Beautiful building with an amazing array of artefacts. Guided tour of Raffles Exhibition was excellent. Our guide was very informative and enthusiastic and we really enjoyed it.
"The Tang shipwreck exhibit is incredible. Look out for the straw cups in porcelain as well as the Hand painted artefacts.Do take the one hour guided tour at first & then spend your time leisurely browsing through the museum. Guide books for every exhibit will provide you with more details.Your entry pass is valid for the entire day & you can take a break, have some refreshments and go back to continue."
"This is, perhaps, the most interesting museum in Singapore. Besides visiting the permanent exhibits, you will have a chance to experience also special ones. Very enjoyable."
Located in one of the splendid old civic buildings an interesting collection of artefacts well presented and explained. The Raffles In Southeast Asia exhibits looking at his life from a scholastic perspective as well as a statesman was very interesting. Well worth a visit when exploring the old civic area.
Museum split over 3 levels with several different exhibits on each level dedicated to certain periods of the regions history. Guided tours at various times by the museum and locals do free tours around the museum as well.
"The ancient civilization museum was beautifully laid out and rich in history. I felt the curators invested a lot of effort in the design and selection of the exhibits and it contributed to a great viewing experience.Admission was $20SGD with discounts for those over 60, students and children. I was given a sticker to wear which showed security I was paying guest.I joined one of the hourly guided tours which covered an overview of the museum but other tours specialized in specific topics. The original intent of the building was to be a courthouse but was mostly left vacant or used as a warehouse until it was repurposed as this museum.On the first floor we were introduced to a Tang Dynasty era shipwreck found in off an island in Indonesia that was full of well preserved ceramics and a small cache of gold and silver. In the rooms next door we explored the different styles of ceramics with Asian themes from around the world. A small cafe was also located by the rear entrance.On the second floor we walked through displays about religions in Asia, Islamic and Christian Art, cultural artifacts dealing with rituals and a retrospective on Stamford Raffles. The third floor contained one room with musical instruments laid out in front of a mock up of a local home and the others contained more contemporary artwork or ceramics."
"Extensive museum full of well presented artefacts covering all over Asia. They are well labelled so you can get around comfortably with the free guide booklets. There are also free guided tours which we experienced and got a lot out of the area covered.It's a great museum. However we found the staff on front desk, gift shop and cafe all poor."
"Seemingly overlooked by many overseas visitors, this is a wonderful collection of regional artefacts with comprehensive explanations of the cultures behind them. It's housed in a historic building (former government offices) which has been carefully conserved. It's not very well signposted and can be difficult to navigate. There's so much to see that it merits more than one visit but sadly there is no provision for multiple entry so you would have to stump for a fresh ticket each time."
"The quality of the collection here cannot be overestimated. Beginning on the first floor with the Tang shipwreck, the complete contents of a Tang dynasty ship wrecked off Java while plying between the Gulf, Indonesia and China, and on through textiles, silverware, totemic objects and stone temple carvings from the region, everything here is the best of its kind. When we were there, a special exhibitions attempting to evaluate the legacy of Sir Stamford Raffles, founder of Singapore, took up a large part of the upper gallery, and here a more diverse selection of artefacts including botanical drawings, ceremonial objects and notebooks were available for inspection. It's a pity the entry fee ($25, which for those of us from Hong Kong and the UK used to free museums is a bit steep) does not allow multiple entry because there is definitely here than the visitor can take in in one visit."
"An amazing museum which is so well put together and covers all Asian civilizations, showing particularly how trade developed in the region with maritime connections also to Europe. Religion, religious beliefs and customs is also well covered and at present there is also a special Raffles exhibition. The display from the Tang Ship was just stunning. There is a cafe and restaurant within the complex and delightful area on the first floor where you can just chill out on beanbags and listen to music or read one of the books on loan from the local library. Wheelchair accessible. Lockers in the basement for storage of backpacks or parcels (20c/50c coin required which is returned on leaving). There is also a gift shop."
"One of the finest art museums in Asia, in my view. Houses an eclectic collection in a stately old colonial building. Includes both folk art and sophisticated pieces influenced by Chinese, Indian, Malay, and British colonial sensibilities."
"Housed in colonial style building, the place is a joy to visit. The admission fee is also reasonable considering how much the place has to offer.All the exhibits are well curated, with plenty of space to move about. There are seats scattered around the different galleries to rest tired feet or for one to enjoy the display for a different perspective. The only downside is the layout of the place can take abit getting used to, but clear signage are scattered near entrance/exit to direct you around.Be prepare to spend at least 2-3 hours to really appreciate what the place has to offer, get ready to lost yourself among the exhibits as each doorway will leads to more artifacts or surprises just waiting to be discovered. To complete to whole experiences do find out the timing for their guided tour, as the commentary from the guides are fantastic.Since the place also houses 2 F&B outlets; Empress and Prive, there is no worries of not being able to find a place for a quick bite while visiting the place."
"The layout was initially confusing and the doors open by surprise. Be sure to read the map/layout to navigate your way around.The curation for this museum was excellent and there were many take away from this exhibition. I enjoyed the Raffles in Southeast Asia (Special Exhibition) is all about. I appreciate how the curators acknowledge William Farquhar as well. Farquhar's collection has always been my favourite.Additionally, I enjoyed the shipwreck exhibition and how the display of the thousands bowl was admirable. Amazing!"
"We love museums but we have a very special feeling about this one. The display regarding the sunken ship full of Tang Dynasty procelains headed for the Middle East, which was found in 1998, was particularly interesting. We loved the other exhibits which drew together Asia in themes e.g. religion, family, death, rather than just present a chronological or geographical rundown. We also enjoyed Prive restaurant just next door which was full of locals enjoying a variety of food at reasonable prices."
One of the best museums I have visited- recently revamped into Themed sections with a variety of toursWe went on the Highlights tour - excellentHighly recommended
"The Asian Civilisations Museum is a must see when you are in Singapore. You can browse for hours, but even if you do not have enough time - a quick visit and an outside lunch are a perfect outing. For anyone who is keen to understand a bit better the roots of Singapore, its evolution and additional Asian cultures."
"My wife and I visited the ACM in December 2018, and we are so glad we did. We have previously always passed this museum by when visiting Singapore, but my advice is to take one of the various and excellent free guided tours to really appreciate this fascinating collection of artifacts.There is an excellent restaurant within the museum, so you can easily spend the morning and afternoon at this excellent and informative attraction. We cannot recommend it highly enough."
So interesting and full of so much History - inclusive of Ancient artifacts.The kids (including the teenager) thoroughly enjoyed the visit and admission cost was quite reasonable.
"Love visiting this particular museum, I could spend half a day or more just observing the thousands of artefacts on showcase. It is a marvel of wonder to look at history and observe how people from the past lived."
"A beautiful collection with Asian art, religion and histrorical objects. As a Dutch, I especially enjoyed all VOC stories that were told to me by the fantastic private guide on the basis of the many exhibits. Who wants to know more about the various Asian gods and religions, can learn interesting lessons here. Take the time for it, because the museum is quite large."
Lots of galleries including china recovered from a shipwreck & galleries on Eastern religions. Good cafe to allow a recharge part way
"I visited the museum on a rainy Saturday. It was quiet and relaxing because of a few visitors. The staff was friendly, and the entrance fee was SGD 8. It is cheaper if you purchase TripAdvisor's ticket, but my payment could not go through TripAdvisor's app. There were paid lockers (two different sizes) for locking your things (25 and 50 cents). The collection from the wreck ship in the Tang dynasty is interesting. Some cute broken cups and containers. Most of the collection here is relatively ""new"" (recent 100 years) and reflects the lives of common people, instead of the fine arts of collections from palaces or royal families. The collection of S. Asian culture is interesting to me. I spent about 2.5 hours at the museum. It was a lovely rainy Saturday at the museum."
"Visited the Asian Museum of Civilisation on the National Day as the museum was offering a free admission promotion.Interesting collection but not too many changes since my visit a few years ago. The jewellery and fabric sections were new to me, and the evolution of dress in mainland China to the Cultural Revolution period was very interesting, with many interesting displays culminating in the 'Mao' suit. The style of the Dowager Empress Cixi was discussed and her control over the Imperial dynasty.The Jewellery was amazing with a high propensity for gold and diamonds during its colonial period. The ethnic items were interesting and items associated with ancestral worship fascinating.The shipwreck collection always fascinates me. Lots of interesting artefacts from the deep. In the adjacent room there are some paintings of 19th century China. A nice museum. I enjoyed my visit."
"A wonderful look at Singaporean history, very well set out display of items. Clear to follow the history in chronological order."
"I spent a nice Sunday morning here. I enjoyed the artifacts - bowls, boxes and figurines. It's not all pictures and I enjoyed the way they presented them - not just by country but by what affected the entire region."
"We've been to singapore many times and always drop in. Lovely museum, the exhibit of the beautifully preserved finds from a shipwreck was the highlight of this trip. We would recommend to friend's"
I spent a couple of hours exploring this museum. You start with what was found in the ship wreck. It was interesting to see how many items they packed on the ship and how they packed them to maximize the quantity. The rest of the museum has interesting galleries with good explanations of the objects. If you are interested in Asian history this is a good museum.
"We spent our last morning here, before departing Singapore. The building itself is gorgeous from the outside. The artifacts from the Tang ship were interesting, but so many dishes!"
Wonderful place to know the history of Asia and its Civilisations. I and my spouse really enjoyed it. But did not have the time to go every bit of the place. Will visit again to catch up. Enjoy everyone.
"This collection quickly outlines some of the key contributing factors, from the last few hundred years, that created the foundations for the Asian countries in existence today. Spanning trade, culture and religion each room tackles a fresh subject. I would have liked to have seen more of an inclusion of Singaporean pieces, as there were very few."
"We had a lovely time visiting and admiring the displays of Guo Pei's exquisitely designed dresses. Every creation of hers was truly a beautiful work of creativity, design and painstaking handiwork. We were most awed and certainly impressed. The Asian Civilisations Museum is certainly the right venue for her displaying her fashion design works."
"It is a really good museum with quite some interesting pieces. Not high on the list unless history buff, but certainly not a waste of time."
"Good collection of artifacts from all over asia,good for understanding history of Singapore and also about different religions which originated from Asia,worth for the ticket,have at least 3 hr,also close to many attractions."
Highly recommend the cafe for a meal. The fancy restaurant was closed and we were caught in a storm there so we decided to try the cafe. We were a little skeptical but decided to try the Hainanese chicken and a couple of other dishes including a salad. it was excellent.
"I saw some real gold coins, gold Kriss sword, and learned about many Asian cultures there. There is a free tour that I had of one of the galleries."
"Was here last week visiting the Guo Pei exhibit, very nice and enjoyed seeing some of the other Asian exhibits. The gift shop though seems to be need of merchandise."
"The museum is conveniently located in a beautiful building. The range of displays means that everyone is catered for. The permanent displays include a fascinating exhibit of artefacts retrieved from a very old shipwreck, leading to further displays of the many items traded between Asian countries and the rest of the world. There is also a comprehensive exhibition about the various Asian religions. At the time of my visit the temporary exhibitions included a kid-focused interactive display of a cardboard world and a group of amazing fashion items designed and produced by a young Chinese designer."
"The exhibits are well laid out and sympathetically displayed.Clearly defined galleries help in understanding the history of Asia.Was lucky enough to visit when the Guo Pei exhibition was on. Not a ""fashionista"" myself, but found the exhibits astounding in their craftsmanship.All on all a very pleasant way to pass a couple of hours in Singapore. Highly recommended"
"This is a large museum space featuring the fashion of Guo Pei and other varied minor exhibitions. The spaces do not seem crowded, the visitor stream flows and it's provides a wonderful inside into many aspects of Asian culture."
"This museum features excellent displays of Chinese ceramics over a thousand years old that had been recovered from a discovered shipwreck. Condition of the pottery and other artifacts is absolutely stunning and beautifully displayed for viewing. Museum also features many very interesting artifacts from various Asian civilizations, providing visitors with a visual and written feast of historical information."
"This was a very well executed museum with lots of history about Southeast Asia. My favorite part was the exhibit about the shipwreck with interesting items and stories depicted. Upstairs, the sections on religions in Southeast Asia were also very informative. After a while the museum does start to seem the same, but it was a beautiful building and a very reasonable entry fee. The cafÃ© inside was also delicious, and the air-conditioning is great. A lot of people seem to think this is one of the best museums in Singapore."
"I split off from the family to take in the Raffles exhibition and it was both informative and enjoyable. The museum proper has several interesting exhibits; the Tang dynasty pottery was an effective way to illustrate the centuries-old trading routes that Singapore has been a part of. Rest of the museum was solid if not spectacular - if they didn't have the very strong Raffles materials, I would have probably had a different opinion."
great place for visitors outside singapore to know more of us as multi-cultural country.as well as for locals to understand better each other races.
"We especially loved the exhibition of the recoveries from the Tang shipwreck which occurred around 800 (if I'm remembering correctly). Beautifully displayed. The entire museum is beautifully done and well worth a visit,"
The Asian Civilisations Museum has an excellent collection of artifacts with good explanation. The goods from the Tang shipwreck are spectacular.Entry is SGD 8 for foreign visitors.
This place offered a venue to chill from the hot weather while bringing you into the time long long time ago through its exhibits.
"I learned a lot during my visit.What I liked the most: 1. The lighting is very well done; at the same time dim enough to be comfortable but focused in the correct locations so that the pieces are put forward. 2, The building is pretty both on the inside and the outside and the rooms are very spacious. 3, There is ample space between pieces and very clear written descriptions. 4, The museum has benches to sit on in most rooms, which is very appreciated during a long visit.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because there is no clear traveling direction. I understand that this may be difficult to plan in such a building but we ended up going into dead-ends and retracing or steps multiple times. But that is a very minor negative. I highly recommend this museum!"
Great artefacts that were displayed in the museum of Tangs Shipwreck! Many & most of the unique china pottery & kitchen wares are still stunningly beautiful and intact with its originality! I am so amaze on the fish bowl . Entry is free just remember to bring along your passport for tourists & Residents bring your identity card to register. Most of the cafes are great for relaxing your tired feet
"Very interesting with photos , items showing Singapore then and compare to now how we have develop into a progress Nations."
"Besides rich artistic heritage of Asia, with interesting programmes like the annual ACM After Dark, Saturdays@ACM, and Lunchtime Concerts."
"Open until 9pm on a Friday night, I enjoyed the evening wandering through here. Loved learning about the trade routes and influences, and understanding Singapore pre-European involvement."
This museum is in a wonderful older building that has been updated inside. They were having a special display when I was here on Raffles one of the men who help develop Singapore. I spent 3 hours here and could have easily spent more.
First time visit since renovations. All very well displayed. Check out the guided tour and special interest talks.
"Centrally located by the old Parliament House and the Fullerton Hotel, flanked by the Singapore River, is this treasure of discovery. We went to eppreciate the Raffles in SouthEast Asia exhibition, in collaboration with the British Museum, and found the guided visit most meaningful. It gave us insights into the motivations of the 'scholar' and the human condition. It was sad that the opening up of trade and economic development involved violence and war, and deceit and loss of lives. A must see!"
"Open daily, on Fridays half price from 7-9pm. Suggested duration: 2-3 hoursThe museum was opened at its current location on March 2, 2003. It specializes in pan-Asian cultures and civilizations. Current exhibits include Exhibit Raffles in Southeast Asia. Galleries on the First Level tell the story of Trade which begins in the 9th century, with the Tang Shipwreck display which consists of more than 1000 pieces of ceramics, gold, and silver. Level 2 galleries are about Faith and Belief: Christian art, Islamic art, and other ancient religion. The entrance fee is $20 and you can enjoy free lunchtime concerts. In the museum you can find restaurant, cafÃ© and restrooms. It is 7 min walk from Waterfront Promenade."
The Asian Civilizations Museum is a good stop to learn about the people in this area. My favorites were the Tang wreck and seeing all those rice bowls that were on the bottom of the see for over 1000 years restored to look like they can used for lunch now. The trade room had paintings depicting scenes of early trade days along with some very good pottery from different places. The religious diety exhibit is core Asian religion. Everything is marked well. I recommend the free highlight tour before or after you stroll around for what should be a total of 90 minutes. Great way to escape the heat downtown also
This is another place I love to revisit. Impressive historical objects ranging from fine porcelain to historical clothing (pyjamas!). Great place to discover the history of the region and the artefacts that are part of the heritage of Asia
"First thing, let's not compare this museum to the great museums of the world, but to museums in cities of comparable size and history. In that case, I found this to be a very good museum, good for a 1/12- 2 hour visit. It is a very nice building, and provides a very nice history of Singapore from an early trading post to a modern city. The collection of Chinese artifacts from the Tang shipwreck was impressive, as well as some of the items from Java.The entrance fee is sing$ 20, 15 for seniors, which is about the same as a drink across the river in Boat Quay so not a bad value. It gives a pretty good history of Singapore as well as a good collection of Chinese and Indonesian artifacts. Worth a visit"
"I liked the museum very much, as from the part in Europe I live the Far Eastern and Southeastern civilizations are not very well represented. I like the Indian and the Chinese artifacts the most. The shipwreck findings are very fine. A must-see museum when in Singapore"
"One of my favourite museums in Singapore. It gives an excellent overview of religious and ceramics art pieces in South East Asia and China, all displayed in a tasteful manner. You can easily spend three hours here."
"Interesting exhibits taking place in this museum. Not the biggest one, but interesting to visit if you're staying in Singapore a bit longer."
"I came back here twice in December with the kids. With young kids you need to keep a close watch so that they don't randomly decide to damage anything, but it's still worth a visit for them. More suited for adults though and you're probably more likely to enjoy the experience without having to supervise young children. Peaceful inside without too many crowds."
"We were informed that The Asian Civilisations Museum is listed on TripAdvisor Traveller's Choice Award for Museums for 2014, 2015, 2017. Open daily from 10am to 7pm. Entry fee is 8 Singapore dollars for Adults. Display is on three levels of its beautiful building. Themes are trade on level one, Faith and Belief on level two, and Materials and designs on level three. Visitors interested in Asian history will find it very useful."
"ACM has added 3 new permanent galleries showcasing islamic art, christianity art and ancestral rituals. The exhibits are quite interesting as they showcase the mixing of religions with local influences such as a statute of Virgin Mary with characteristics of the Goddess of Mercy."
"Well worth a visit. Only S$8 for tourists and a good couple of hours viewing. The Tang shipwreck exhibits and information were excellent. Things we felt could be improved - signage throughout the museum between the sections - there is no natural flow so you often double back or view things out of order; possible audio tour of specific exhibitions to provide more ""colour"". These are minor - it was an excellent morning spent."
"The building style is unique, and feels like I'm in another country. I'm not much of a museum person but this was pretty educational and I feel like I understand the Singapore culture better."
"Many Southeast Asian cultures handicraft. There are chinese scrolls, paintings, porcelain wares, as well as the props used in Chinese performing arts. You can also find artifacts such as intricately-detailed Palembang lacquerware and carving that represents the vehicle of the hindu goddess.There's also the gallery of Singapore River that brings you through the history and evolution."
"They regularly have various themes of exhibitions every few months. Also, during major public holidays in Singapore, there are lots of activities suitable for children."
There is beautiful display of an Tang shipwreck from about 1000. All of the exhibits were very well displayed and described. Well worth a visit.
I chose to go to the museum since I am interested in Asian civilisations. 3 levels. it took me roughly 1 hour.
"Enjoyed learning about history and seeing the displays that dated back a long time Easy to do at own pace, not over crowded."
"The Asian Civilisations Museum is opposite the Fullerton Hotel. It is a beautiful building which has exhibits on three floors.The exhibits tell the story of Asian civilisation through the ages. In one gallery there is a story of a shipwreck. Other galleries have exhibits of jewellery, ceramic and porcelain pottery, art and calligraphy, depictions of various religious beliefs etc. All the exhibits are beautiful and are well documented.The museum is a place of cultural education. I would recommend that you take a guided tour. There are many additional bits of information that the guide will give you.At the end of your tour, you will welcome a visit to the cafe which sells a selection of hot and cold drinks and snacks. I would recommend a visit to the souvenir shop too.The museum is open daily from 10am to 7pm - but on Fridays it closes at 9pm. Admission is free to Singapore citizens and permanent residents. Adult foreign visitors have to pay SGD8 - but if visiting on a Friday between 7pm and 9pm - the price is SGD4."
Nothing special for this building. It has good array of color which interesting for Photography point of view. Prepare your wide lens and shoot.
We stumbled upon this museum on a hot day and the cooling building was a welcome reprieve from the hot sun. The highlight was the Tang shipwreck exhibit. The museum's collections were varied and vast and you could spend many hours wandering around. The kids got a little bored so it would be great if they would introduce more child friendly an interactive exhibits.
Anyone who likes to get a glimpse of the way Asians lived and survived through times should visit - great place to discover.
"ACM is a museum focusing on the historical connections between the cultures of Asia especially since Singapore was a port city integrating people from all over the world. Level 1 features the maritime trade, the Tang Shipwreck and event spaces. Level 2 features Christian and Islamic art and ancient religions. Level 3 is devoted to Chinese ceramics. It is worth a visit if you have the time to do so"
I went a few times to see different temporary exhibitions. Admission tickets are not so kind for special exhibitions and but displays rare and unique objects and artefacts. The cafe on the ground floor has a nice view and it adds something little extra on top of the museum experience.
Close to city centre. Very interesting exhibitions. Showing how people of various races come together to form a nation.
The Asian Civilisations Museum is well displayed and informative for the foreign tourist wanting to learn about Singapore and its peoples' early beginnings. Well worth a visit.
"As to be expected, very comprehensive, detailed collection of artefacts. Their importance could be impressed on visitors more perhaps by an interactive way of engaging visitors - makes me think about the Wellcome Collection which really is innovative in how it engages visitors - this hugely important collection might benefit from such an approach if at all possible."
"It is not a very huge museum, but most of the time I can feel the curator always trying to make the exhibition being lively and showing only the essence."
"This place is free for Singaporean and Singapore PR, an interesting place to bring young children to learn about Singapore. Exhibition changes from time to time, with many interactive activities."
"When I visited the museum, I was quite lucky as they're having a free tour covering their temporary exhibition about Angkor Wat and Cambodian history. The guide was an expert in Southeast Asian history so, she was capable of explaining even the very small (and most often neglected) details about this very exhibition. The only cons about this tour is that her accent is very French-ish so it's quite a difficulty for those who is unaccustomed to such accent.The permanent exhibition, I find it rather underwhelming, and its storyline is not as enjoyable as, let's say, National Museum of Singapore. Still a good experience though."
"It was a long awaited visit. The new exhibition about Ang Kor Wat was really good. If you are one for history and culture, this is what you should go for. The artefacts are from France so it is an exciting collection to view. It is paid entry for this particular exhibition. I liked it."
"This is an overwhelming museum, full of great information about the history of Asia and how trade between nations built it. The signage is in English and well-done. My one complaint, such as it is, is that there is almost too much to see in a single visit and the price is a bit high ($20S), but well worth it."
"When you're in Singapore and it rains, locals may point you to shopping. Go to a museum instead. As the museum describes: 'It's a Harbor of History, although the Singapore River is considered modest in comparison to the Chao Phraya, Mekong, or Yangtze Rivers. It flows less than 4km from its source near Fort Canning Hill to the sea, but has long been an important waterway. Themes draw from Singapore's nature as a cosmopolitan, multicultural, multi religious poet and trading city.' It gives you a glimpse of how cultures merged and helps appreciate the complexity of the area. I stumbled on it walking with colleagues who were headed to get drinks. I told them I'd catch up and I'm so glad I did. Even though I went though quickly, it helped me see more as we went to Lau Pa Sat Festival Market."
"The ""sunken ship"" exhibit is wonderful. I want a set of those plates for myself even if they're neither dishwasher nor microwave safe. The rest of the Chinese pottery on exhibit is also terrific and the ""religion "" exhibit is very interesting. Visiting is well worth the 3 or 4 hours you'd spend."
"wonderful exhibits and very helpful staff. We loved every moment of the visit. This is a fantastic museum that presents Asian links and influences in trade, art and religion."
"One hour guided tour was free, guide was knowledgeable and friendly. Afterward you were free to roam and explore further. Excellent display of recovered shipwreck items including hundreds of ceramics. Stunning statues showing a mix of cultures, religions."
"I don't have high expectations before I visited this museum but this place has exceeded my expectations. There are many interesting exhibits. If you are tired, you can take a break at the Prive Cafe."
"Not on par with the V&A but the museum was lovely with some very interesting artefacts inside. They also have free little information leaflets in every room describing what is on show, something I have noticed a lot in Asia but not so much in Europe.However, as a warning to fellow Singapore residents, we were not allowed to enter the museum for free, as the website states, DESPITE having a full permanent residents card. We did argue a little with the front desk, but they were adamant that we did not qualify for the discount. This didn't exactly ruin our afternoon, the tickets were only $8 each, but obviously when you are not expecting to pay anything and then get told you have to pay, it sours the experience a little."
"Large sections of china pottery and the history behind the development and trade linkages.The special exhibit of the recovered Arab vessel with over 50,000 pieces of china is very good."
Spent about 1-2 hours in this museum which was enough time to enjoy the exhibits. There are free lecture tours if interested .The admission is 8$. If you are an enthusiast in history you could probably spend longer. Enjoyed the cultural exhibits
"I'm bothered that a number of reviewers seem to have so little appreciated this wonderful collection. Yes, due to renovations the current exhibit is somewhat small, though certainly enough to engage and delight the viewer for an hour or more. I will acknowledge that when I visited several years ago they displayed a much broader collection of regional art whereas the current display focuses primarily on Buddhist and Hindu art. Yes, there are certainly better and more extensive collections in other major world cities, but if you're in Singapore this is the place to go for some quiet contemplation away from the heat and humidity. There are a number of marvelous and unusual pieces here, especially of Buddhist art from the 2nd century on. If patrons want more detailed explanation and contextualization, they can read a book, I go to appreciate the art of religious expression not to get a history lesson. I would add that, while it will not blow you away with beauty, the artifacts in the Tang Shipwreck display do cause one to ponder the incredible extent of trade in the region more than 1000 years ago."
"The ACM is not a huge museum, however, does have quite a few interesting exhibits. The ship wreck gallery is very well done. There is a restaurant and Prive Cafe there as well. Pop in and have a look."
"Located nearby Fullerton Hotel, this place is quite a distance from Raffles Place MRT line. At that time of my visit was in this month ( December ). For the month of December, they are allowing free entrance for both Singaporean and forgeiner. The staff at the museum are very friendly and helpful. The staff will also give you a brochure on the map of the museum before you enter the exhibitions.At the museum, you will see a variety of exhibition. The Tang Shipwreck was a meaningful exhibition. You will also see many collectables and antique items on display which is worth a lot of money. The description for the item are very well written and easy to understand. There is also a gift shop near the exit of the museum as you can stop by to buy souvenirs."
"If you have spare time or want to spend a meaningful few hours with your family, visit the ACM to learn more about the culture & history of Singapore."
A good presentation of South Asian Trade History. Especially from China and India.I expected also a bit Malay History but there is almost none.
An enjoyable two to three hour visit can provide you with a wide ranging overview of Asian history and peoples.
"The Tang Shipwreck is on display. it opens your eyes to the trade in Asia at the time of the Tang Dynasty. Also on display are various art pieces from various area of Asia- many of these are religious pieces- some from China, some from Mynamar, some from Vietnam, a few from Thailand, Cambodia, , Sri Lanka, and a very few and very special pieces from Gandhara some from India. Many are religious pieces; others are beautiful porcelain., mostly from China"
"Great location, nice view. Went for a business event, location is very convenient for people in the CBD."
The museum is a historic building from the colonial times and regularly holds thematic exhibitions which are interesting to fans of history and culture. The permanent exhibits are also worth visiting if you are new to the museum.
The museum is quite spacious and nice to walk around. Free guided tours can give you more background.
"Mostly visits to Singapore involve shopping, eating and more shopping. However, Singapore is blessed with several good museums including the Asian Civilization Museum. This Museum is very interesting in 3 respects:1. It gives a good account of PERANAKAN - unique to Singapore's culture. It refers to the practices of a merged Malay & Chinese culture. These practices are still happening today.2.Displays of Multi Asian exhibits such Caligraphy etc3. Special exhibits are held from time to time that are not often seen in public. More recently, the importance of the Singapore River was on display.Its location is also close by Raffles Landing Site, close by the Singapore River where a great walk along the river is much enjoyable."
"I went to this museum for the second time. Their standard collection was limited due to rebuilding activities. However the special was about the ""silk routes"" which was very interesting"
Very enjoyable tour with a museum guide. I think I got much more out of my visit because I joined one of the museum's guided tours.
A place for learning interesting history of civilization. alot of new galleries every year with interesting artifacts.
"This museum is interesting to visit, you will see all the Asian Civilisation, you can see the jewellery, the plates, the coins, the costumes, all the story"
"Very informative guided tour organized by the docents at ACM. The tour starts promptly at 11am, and ends within an hour.One of the most interesting commentary was about the Tang shipwreck, as well as how punch was invented by a King who had more than 100million subjects."
"Several areas of the museum were closed for renovation when we visited which was a bit disappointing but what we were able to see was very interesting.However, the standout room in the museum is the one housing the exhibits from the Tang Shipwreck. In this room there is an amazing display of items recovered from a ship that sank over 1,000 years ago en route from China to Africa. When the wreck was discovered tens of thousands of items were found, most of which were in pristine condition. The display is awesome because the items, particularly the earthenware bowls, look just as they must have looked when packed onto the ship over a thousand years ago. If you are visiting the Colonial District of Singapore make the effort to visit the museum if only to see the exhibits from the Tang Shipwreck."
"This is my third visit here and each one has been a real pleasure. At best this is an afternoon of entertainment. The exhibits are very interesting, particularly the shipwreck, Not being fully versed in Asian history this has provided a very good place to start. A chronology map would have been helpful.Afterwards I had a good coffee and a delicious piece of cake in the restaurant adjoining the museum"
Good place to visit. The place is well equipped with lots of information on the Asian civilisation. I spent at least two to three hours looking and reading all the description.
Close to city centre. A cool quiet place to get out of the heat. Very interesting exhibitions. If you're tired of asian food the cafe is airconditioned and offers some European food which is reasonably priced.
"intersting museum in a beautiful building, showing how people of various races come together to form a nation. very good ceramics section."
"It's a little museum when you will spend some time on afternoon.I really enjoyed :""Tang Shipwreck"" with its impressive collection of intact items.""Trade"": My favorite place, you can really imagine the ""silk road"" and exchanges between cultures, empires and countries. I liked some object mixing the best of art of France and Asian cultures.""The scholar in the Chinese Culture"" was good, I would like to see more elements, it's a good starter to explore this theme.This museum gave me interest in continuing the exploration of Asian culture. Tomorrow, I'll go the the National Museum of Singapore !If you want to spend 2 hours, come there - better than Malls ..."
"For a very low admission, this museum is great value. It is a great balance for those of us that want to read all the cards and those who want to keep moving. The standing exhibits are remarkable and help you understand how pieces of art can help us understand economics and trade."
"Visited the Asian Civilisations Museum exiting it fill in an hour or, but before I knew it, 3.5 hrs had passed.A rich and vibrant museum showcasing local Singaporean culture as well as Chinese and Muslim cultures. Plenty of artefacts to look and admire, and well worth a visit.Some of the galleries were under renovation during my visit, but that didn't detract from the experience and I'm sure the museum will be even better once they are completed."
"Here you can a find a few exhibits. At the moment, the exhibits are Ancient Religions, The Scholar in Chinese Culture, A Space for Contemporary Art, Tang Shipwreck and Chinese Ceramics. There are some guided tours you can join at a specific timing. It is near the Raffles MRT station and Fullerton Hotel.Admission for Singaporeans, Permanent Residents are free admission to the permanent galleries. Tourist is free too except for Special Exhibitions.There is a restaurant called PrivÃ© that serves sweet treats and freshly-baked cakes. The cosy indoor space has a unique nostalgic feel."
Environment is nice and immerse.Nice ambience . Good hangout place for the wholeday. Interesting to visit.
awesome place for family with kids.Conviently located near to train station.many other place of interest nearby.
Good place to visit to get some info before planning to travel to the neighboring countries to know more about their culture and history
"I went to the Tang Shipwreck with high expectations, unfortunately I was disappointed. The exhibition consists almost entirely of pottery. There was no remnants of the boat itself. In other similar museum exhibits e.g. Mary Rose in Portsmouth, the highlights have been the everyday items of the crew. None of these items were recovered with this shipwreck, probably because the crew lived on the deck."
Visited this Jan 2020. Small museum with some very good artefacts especially the horde of 9th Century ceramics found on a sunken ship in late 1990's. Has a pleasant cafe although on our visit service was rather slow
"I think I had to high expectations on this museum. Don't get me wrong, it's a good museum, but it wasn't as amazing as I'd hoped. If you generally enjoy this type of museum, you should absolutely visit it. But perhaps lower your expectations a bit..."
"Love the building, has a lot of character and was a great experience visiting the place! For sure a worth experience for travellers"
It was okay but I wasn't too impressed. I thought I'll have a look around but apart from the section about the ship wreck I wasn't too engaged in the exhibitions. So unless you are interested in this topic you may like to consider visiting other places instead.
"its worth to see, cooling inside despite the hot weather. worth to see once with family.kids would like it too but not that much"
"This to me is the highlight of the exhibits here and could have been arranged such that it is the last to see. Still it is great to have it at the entrance.Within the dome, the exhibits are arranged by floors, starting at level 7. You got to take the lift up to 6 and climb the rest of the way via staircase.Best part to me is the suspended walkway where you could look over and best floor is the cavern which is at one of the lower floors.This whole experience could have been improved if the waterfall is seen at the end of the trip, with the sound for the waterfall acting as a very powerful tease the entire time you are inside.Bestest experience here is the air conditioned which is a welcoming oasis after wandering around the outdoor displays at Gardens by the Bay."
A unique experience and worth a visit if you like your greenery. Nice to be able to walk around the waterfall.
"A gigantic waterfall, thousands of different plants from all over the world, great views of the surroundings makes this a nice place to visit in Singapore."
"Cool experience! The waterfall was impressive, as are the plants etc and it's a fun experience going to the top and back down again!"
"This place is much cooler than Flower Dome. A towering waterfall with soothing gushing sound, mists spewing out amidst a forested landscape , this is certainly an experience worth coming & paying for.Walk up the elevated path above & have a casual walk & bird's eye view within the Dome & outside.Again sadly, this usually packed attraction place were empty with few locals..Although both domes are air-conditioned, Cloud Forest is much cooler than Flower Dome."
"known for it's impressive 115ft waterfall. As soon as you walk in the sight greets you, as well as the hundreds of tourists gathering at the bottom for a photograph. Having had a relatively quiet morning we found the next leg of our day extremely busy. I made the mistake of wearing a maxi dress to the gardens and had people constantly standing on my dress.In the cloud forest you follow a walkway that snakes around a plant clad mountain. This does streamline the crowds but there were no points where it was too overwhelming. Despite the hot and humid weather outside the conservatory was very cool to walk around and a welcome respite. "
"It is amazingly difficult to put in to words this attraction. It is a MUST SEE if you go to Singapore and for me it was the best and most amazing part of Gardens by the Bay. I have been to all kinds of gardens, including enclosed ones. Most of the time it is to keep the plants warm enough, here it is to keep them cool enough. There is simply nothing like it in the world.You walk in and are greeted by an incredible green waterfall and then you walk around this verdant mountain of various plants. Every turn is unbelievable. There are full grown trees and incredible views through the glass enclosure and this is before the main attraction when you ride the elevator 7 stories to the top of the mountain to begin a leisurely walk down. Again the views and the plants are amazing. The pictures will show you but they dont do it justice. You just have to go."
This is the best paet as you enter the mountain high water fall is epic well done Team so such an good and breath taking experience and it was nice and foggy with excitement and we made our way up via lift and walked down from level 7 was an amazing experience.
"Go in the morning to catch the beautiful sunrays. It's cool for the growth of these plants that grow in the mountains, bring a jacket if you are afraid of the cold."
"Very cool indoor structure explaining what a cloud forest is about and what it may seem like. At every other corner in the whole indoor structure, I found amazing views of different parts of the Singapore. It's rather cold but if you are coming in from the very hot weather outside, the temperature is just perfect."
If you visit Gardens by the Bay then don't miss this fabulous biosphere. The planting and water features are on a huge scale and really impressive.
"Very nice place Several types of vegetation and reconstituted landscapes, very touristic but funny place nice to walk into the surounding garden where lot of animations are done. Lot of singapourien peoples go there durin We"
As soon as you walk into the dome you fell different and excited the second you walk in. I highly recommend going there again
We visited the cloud forest and were blown away by the beauty of this place it far exceeded our expectations we love it so beautiful
Cloud forest amzing place to bond with friends.I enjoy the trees and some views there..I never though I enjoy this year 2020 been there 2x .This year is the best
"Well, its something you must see in singapore whenever you are visiting the garden by the bay!Its very cold indoor garden with some restaurants inside as well!It can be very crowded so try to come earlier! or before closing!enjoy the nature ahead!"
"This was also amazing experience, but try and come while there is still enough sunlight, during night time it is much harder to see everything inside and fully enjoy."
"The exhibits were all very pretty and there was many good camera spots.Their staff were also assuring and kind. My son has a fall during the trip and his knee bled profusely. Thankfully, there was swift first aid assistance from one of their ambassadors. They even assisted us to get to the carpark as my son was not mobile. Thumbs up for good customer service."
"This is a fun and informative place, especially if you like greenery and water, but it's really crowded so you have to move with the crowd."
"Of course this is an impressive place to visit if it's your first time, or even your first few times. But after you've been 10 or more times it begins to lose its appeal. Unlike the Flower Dome there don't seem to be too many obvious changes in scenery here. Still a nice way to escape the heat outside."
"Didn'´t know what to expect when I came there but this blew my mind away. It was well designed, easy to navigate trough and always something to stop to take a better look at. I think I spent 2 hours there but honestly I'´m not sure."
This place is a man made paradise with different structures of shrubs and bushes inside a dome. The temperature is well maintained to keep the the dome cool. This place is worth a visit.
"we absolutely loved the entire area- wandering into unusual and quite unexpected areas.the waterfall, plants and the may levels were wonderful"
"As you walk through the entrance of the cloud forest you will see a large waterfall and it is spectacular. We spent such a long time in here enjoying the layers of gardens, the walkways and the ambiance of the Cloud Forest. The vegetation, with so much variety, and the waterfalls are amazing, so much work has gone into the detail. The air conditioning was an added bonus. The whole visit was a fabulous experience. I would definitely recommend a visit."
The cloud forest is one of two gardens housed in the plaza and is the world's largest column-less greenhouse. We booked this through Klook as a bundled package that also included the flower garden and outdoor walkway for 22 USD per person. The forest offers free tours for groups of 5 or more but you can also venture on your own in around 1.5 hours. When you first enter there'll be large crowds trying to get pictures so it may be hard to get one without people in it. Once you get past there you are able to walk all around the base and when you're ready can begin your ascent towards the top. There are a series of escalators and elevators that will take you up to the top. Once you leave the ground level you will no longer be allowed to go back so keep that in mind. You'll be able to visit the different levels on your way up which give unique perspectives of the waterfalls. Since it is a greenhouse you'll be able to see through and get an interesting perspective of a forest hidden in the city. As you complete your ascent you'll then begin going down the various levels which have some educational information on the forests. We were happy to see several educational pieces about our carbon footprint as humans and how we can help reduce it to protect these marvels. Afterwards if you purchased a flower garden ticket you'll just cross the walkway outside to enter the other exhibit and you can re-enter with a hand stamp to either one. We both found the cloud forest to be a very interesting twist on a traditional greenhouse and worth visiting especially due to the bundled price!- @wanderingwithustwo
"Cloud Forest is one of the indoor forests in the world. It is so beautiful and amazing. The best thing is that it has a huge waterfall and if you want to reach to the top of it you need to cross a huge, large, beautiful. And that bridge is no normal bridge it is a mind-blowing bridge! Old people can also cross using a wheelchair because it is very long. It is full of cold breezes so I am telling you to wear a shawl or a light sweater or a light jacket. It is so wonderful full of flowers and it is the best chance to show off your photography skills. I recommend all travelers to visit this place for sure!"
"What an experience! The Cloud Forest is breathtaking, unlike anything we've ever seen. You can go up multiple levels and walk around on metal walkway with stunning views of Gardens by the Bay and the surround area.Not to be missed!The only thing I'd say is definitely take a light jacket as it's rather chilly in there, in order to preserve all the lush greenery."
"You need to take a deep breath after the flower doom because you will encounter the gigantic indoor manmade forest, it's mysteriously beautiful. The hidden floral gems are there. So don't missed to visit ."
"A beautiful place, it is amazing how they have managed to create an artificial tropical forest. I loved the gardens with the pitcher plants mingled with orchids. Great place to visit would highly recommend this place. :)"
Outstanding use of materials and architecture with lots of creativity. Worth a visit in this busy city state.
"This location is a must see for everyone visiting Singapore..The architecture is one thing, but to see all around and do the walkway up and inside the mountain with the giant waterfall is something else....."
"In the Cloud Forest, there is the Gigant Water Fall! There's Legos models of catching bugs plants. A lots of Plants, Flowers and Stones. It's very clean too! And there no problems here!"
Amazing orchid gardens inside and the waterfall is truly breathtaking. Entry ticket is mandatory. Located Inside the gardens by the bay.
Was this a great adventure to see. From the start of the rain forest right down to the base of the forested areas. The curators of this gem should take a big pat on the back.
It was just amazing. Air conditioned so comfortable for walking. Amazing plants and LEGO display. Massive waterfall which you can view from the board walk at the top.
"A man made forest with controlled weather! Who would have thought? Why did they build it? I don't know, but I'm pleased they did. You take an elevator up to the top (most people do) and then wind your way down the path to the exit observing different plants and educational opportunities. Very nice!"
Worth the visit as you wind your way up.Cool and great 360 degree views.Great selection of orchids and flowers
Superbly constructed garden house with fabulous plants and brilliant walk around routes through the various areas . Immaculate presentations at every point.
It was a fantastic place to stop and take in the views. Incredibly cool and refreshing atmosphere that set the tone for the entire visit.
We visited both dome and I loved the Cloud forest the most. It had a lot of beautiful plants and many waterfalls etc...
This is part of the gardens by the bay. Well worth a visit. So many different plants from all over the world.
"If I had to choose between the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome, I would choose the Cloud Forest. My favourite part has to be the waterfall. Simply amazing to look at!"
I loved walking here and spent the better part of a morning enjoying the environment and atmosphere here
Cloud forest was a surprising venue. Lots of information about the native climates and educational displays.We enjoyed walking through the different enviroments and displays.
This was our second visit to the cloudy forrest and it had some new features to see.Several deck inside the artificial mountain. And several places to take nice photos.It has a waterfall which is nice.We usually visit a couple of times a year since there is some new exhibitions depending which season it is om the complex.Will for sure recommend a visit.
"For me, the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome are two of the really outstanding sights of Singapore!!!"
Closed not happy as we had paid to visit with the other dome. Poor effort by trip advisor. Check to see it is fully open before you buy tickets.
"We went here in the late afternoon and it was a great escape from the heat of the city. This place is gorgeous! The most stunning part is the huge waterfall right at the entrance. Be sure to stay for one the mistings that happen on even hours (eg. 2, 4, 6)."
"One can easily spend an hour or 2 to leisurely enjoy the flowers, plants and landscaping within the conservatory. With the air-conditioned and mist, it is a cooling experience to explore this great attraction. Besides the ground level, there are the Cloud Walk and Treetop Walk so that visitors can get close and personal with nature. Highly recommended to visit the Flower Dome too."
"I really enjoyed my time at the Cloud Forest, probably slightly more than the Gardens, largely due to the fact of the educational aspect of it. It is a wonderful living museum to the earth and its contents are wrapped in and around exhibit after exhibit. Truly a stunning destination and a sight to behold. Much to learn here about our ecosystems, and we felt like we were part of something more important after we had left."
"After the disappointment of the flower dome, this was a really great pick- me-up. The waterfall is spectacular, there s a lovely walk around the conservatory leading to an orchid section which was beautiful. You then make your way up to the top of the waterfall for a view of the conservatory in it' full glory, There is then a high level boardwalk back to ground level. Very impressive and good value for money"
A very unique place with lot of plants and flowers. A must visit place in singapore.Very cool place
"This is a must do in Singapore, it's pretty unique and impressive when you're in front of this massive wall of green"
"cloud forest is opposite side of flower dom, garden by the bay, marina sands bay, flower dom and cloud forest are at one place only.buy tickets from garden by the bay ticket window. experience of cloud forest is one of the best in Singapore, if you are keen to know about different plants, trees and flowers then must visit place if not then also visit once to experience amazing, clear, fresh and cool ambiance. walking on bridge from top to bottom will be best experience. cloud forest and flower dom will take 3-4 hours."
"Nice, tropical indoor waterfall with a lot of nice plants and flowers. Great architecture and together with the Flower Dome a must visit if you are in Singapore."
What a surprise. How did they create it? Fascinating even for those who are not gardeners.Very good value. Get a discount with your Singapore Airlines Boarding Card
I love this place! Very cool here. But I can see many variety of plants. I think it would be better to come here in the morning because the air is very cool
A sight not to be mised if you see during day hours a good place to remain cool excelent even if you have trouble walking very wheelchair and pram friendly
We enjoyed this and just wondered about all the work that must go into it to keep it looking so fresh and healthy.
"You need to see it, fantastic experience. The waterfall is incredible. Well worth a visit if you are in town."
You climb up to see the various plants in this huge pavillion. It compliments the Gardens by The Bay. As you are within the waterfall you get an incredible perspective looking down.
"Nice structure and interesting to walk around, we enjoyed our visit to this one in particular, compared to some of the other paid for attractions in the Garden area"
"This is incredible, a forest inside an airconditioned dome. Upon entry you are greeted by a magnificent waterfall. Take the lift to the top 7th floor and work your way down winding walkways and viewing platforms.The plants and flowers are just beautiful a living piece of art.If visiting Garden by the Bay take the time to visit the cloud forest."
"As the name suggests, this is a structure in the Gardens by the Bay that is a forest built to be high up culminating in a waterfall to imitate an actual cloud forest. Lots of information about sustainability and how much damage we're doing to the fragile ecosystem. Along the way up (or down), there are exhibitions on sustainability, caverns, fantastic flowers on display, an amazing walkway that give you a great view of not only the cloud forest up and down, but also the Supertree Grove and Sands Expo. Not to be missed in Singapore."
"Indoor waterfall, clouds, brilliant walk from the top. Don't miss the misting session. Best to be in and among it."
"This is a absolute favorite. If you made the trek to the gardens by the bay, put up some cash for a trip to this enchanted forest and garden up in the clouds.The tiered levels as you ascend makes it feel and smell like you are in the clouds. If can get a bit misty and foggy in parts as you make your way up.There's every mix and color of orchids you could think up. So many unusual blends of gorgeous and wild flowers everywhere.It's a result of the beauty nature can yield if left to their own devices."
A must see. The details and thought that went into this are exceptional. It's one of a kind and should not be missed.
"Omg what a wonderful place you have a walk way that goes round , you start at the top & go downGood for familiesThe plants are beautiful & there's a waterfall as you go in"
"A definite 'Not to be missed' experience.Such an incredible concept, a cloud forest inside an air conditioned dome! On entry you are confronted by a huge waterfall, move on and you take a lift to the top of the waterfall, from there you take aerial,walkways to slowly wend your way down! If you want a preview you can explore INSIDE via Google Earth."
This Has spectacular entrance straight seeing the waterfall with the green rainforest colours .So much to see when you going up . All the way on the top you have a nice overview.
"It's amazing to see all the different plants that make up the mountain walls, each more interesting than the next. I enjoyed the walkways as you kept getting a new angle at each turn. I revisited during the day for the misting and evening lighting effects."
"In the midst of the heat, in the middle of the Corona Virus Scare we decided to spend a Saturday at the Cloud Forest. Or in the Cloud Forest. First of all, bring a real shirt, or a light sweater or jacket because the temperature is quite a bit lower than outside. The Cloud Forest is a variation on the greenhouse theme and in this case it's a very expensive and very interesting one. A little too much oriented towards school trips when it comes to global warming et al but well done and, of course, important. But the whole highly expensive making of an artificial cloud forest is quite something to see. Worth it - and a great way to escape the heat. Normally I get the feeling that this is quite crowded, but with the virus scare it was lightly attended. I think it fair to say that people from 4 years old and up will get quite a kick out of it. Not for those who are truly afraid of heights."
Cloud Forest is absolutely breathtaking! Beautiful! Cannot compare it to anything else; it is one-of-a-kind. NOT TO BE MISSED
The cloud forest has different flora and fauna from different region. You are greeted by an amazing waterfall which is great for photos. It's a respite from the tropical heat. It's a great experience walking through the forest - we can even see Singapore's skyline as a backdrop.
this is one place all tourists should not missed. You will be induldge by the beuty and thre coolness and refreshing atmosphere here. Go seeing is believing don't believe without beeing there.
I visited many times and was enchanted. Also very good learning tool on Global Warming!Always a pleasure to re visit
Nice gardens with large towering waterfall in centre. Every so often the dome fills up with steam to make a cloud effect. Worth doing this visit in combination with the Gardens by the bay.
"This is a MUST. It is fantastic and spectacular. If you get cold easy, take a jacket with you, the temperature is quite low."
"We were very impressed by the diverse range of plants on display. The waterfall was so high my camera could not take it all in one photo! The sky walk is great, but better signage to the lift to the top would have appreciated. While there is good access for disabled visitors the lift to the very top was not easily located."
"Gardens by the Bay is definitely worth the visit and this has to be the best part! We loved walking all the way up, moving out onto the platforms and learning about the forest habitat. A real engineering and botanical feat."
Best experience with this place and memorable moments. Fun moments and also crazy feelings with this place
"Just fabulous place to see, massive waterfall, beautiful plants and flowers. It's also nice and cool inside.. definitely a must if your in Singapore."
"Cloud Forest is a famous attraction inside "" Gardens by the Bay "" in Singapore's. Its worth visiting for nature lovers. You are in entirely new world...feel like on some artificial planet like in Hollywood movies. U will get mesmerized. most impressive attractions."
Really enjoyed the cloud forest. Ensure you allocate some time for the walk around inside to take some good photos. The structure is impressive.
"Stepping out of the still muggy heat into the refreshing negative-ion rich atmosphere of the Cloud Forest, took my breath away. Looking up,way way up, at the water cascading gently down, enveloped by the sights and sounds of the semi- self-contained ecosystem, a thought made my eyes wet: Within this vast dome, the creators have boldly created into real life what the Hollywood makers Wakanda in Black Panther could only make us dream of. It is an inspirational wonder of the world. And it comes, unexpectedly, with an effective educational warning. Near the very end, all visitors are led out of the airy light through a darkened chamber. A dramatic hard hitting summary the state of the planet's threatened ecosystem outside the bubble is laid out in unambiguous terms. Rather than disgorge you crest fallen, back into that outside world, you are first gently treated to one more section of astounding condensed beauty, bolstering the spirit and hopefully the resolve. Well done Singapore!"
"I must admit that this attraction in Gardens By The Bay is really breathtakingly spectacular. One can spent such a long time in here enjoying the layers of gardens, the walkways and the ambiance of the Cloud Forest. The vegetation, with so much variety, and the waterfalls are amazing, so much work has gone into the detail. The air conditioning was an added bonus. The whole visit was a fabulous experience."
Don't miss this. What a beautiful place. Highly recommend visiting in the evening when the misters are activated.
"Here another fantastic creation of design , an assortment of plants , trees , shrubs from all over the world , interesting for all those who visit"
Went to the cloud dome where they had an orchid exhibition these orchids were stunning some even had a really strong perfume scent the whole area is truelly wonderful its good that they change exhibits so always something new
"I was unsure if this would be both it but I can confirm this was wonderful, the walks and areas were amazing. I absolutely lovely and just stunning. Price factor was good and my son who is 4 years old, enjoyed it too."
enter to look straight at a 30m high waterfall. Great displays all around with a special Orchid show on when we were there.
"The Gardens by the Bay is a must see attraction, and along with its sister dome (Flower Dome) the Cloud Forest was a fabulous experience ... the round up video and images quite emotional. Highly recommended."
Beautiful dome conservatory filled with a rainbow of colours and even a waterfall!!!There is a charge for the 2 domes but worth every penny for the architecture the plants and the artistic architectural structures or even if the kids are present the hung walkways and carvings hidden beneath the plants will keep them occupied whilst they create an adventure.This attraction is suitable for all with ramps and lifts available for wheelchairs and pushchairs.
"The Cloud Forest was the real highlight of Gardens by the bay for me. It's a stunning structure, really well designed with a simulated cloud forest."
I thought this was a great experience. if you have the time visit as it is really worth seeing.It was not expensive the gardens and cloud forest.
Cloud forest is to be felt rather than seen. The atmosphere created is beyond words can express. What stuns me is that this is all man made.
"When in Singapore, a visit to the Cloud Forest and the Gardens by the Bay is a must. To be fair... it's busy a tourist stop, but it's worth the crowds. The gardens are stunning and the evening light show in the Cloud Forest is stunning. Ironic how we line up to seed ""fake"" trees, but the truth is Singapore offers a lot of beautiful gardens and nature parks to visit. By you tickets in advance and skip some of the lines."
"A different and interesting setting. It was really cool in the dome, it was refreshing. We had to walk a lot, but it was fun. You're sure to be amazed by the view."
A chargeable extra at Gardens by the Bay but worth the money. The design of the building is amazing with giant waterfalls and suspended walkways. Good place to cool down in heat.
"We purchased the combo ticket that included the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. But I preferred the Cloud Forest over the Flower Dome, as I liked the waterfall which is a very nice feature, this is one of the first things you see when you enter the Cloud Forest. And i believe they arrange the plant in a position as close as their normal habitat. You can also saw the gem stone crystal in a raw form, and the cave stone (stalactite - stalagmite) stone here.And it's indoor.. Great thing, cause it's either hot sunny day and wet pour down rainy day outside."
A great place to wander around and view some of the beautiful nature from all parts of the globe. An interesting slant on man made creations. The architecture of the building is of interest to me along with the location being reclaimed swamp land.
"Booked this on a joint ticket with the Flower Dome, and this is vastly superior.Several different levels allow you to view the flowers, and a large waterfall gave it an added dimension.Ascending is mainly by escalator.There is a disabled lift, but one of the assistants said my partner, who has difficulty walking, couldn't use it because she wasn't in a wheelchair? She gave in eventually, but not a good experience."
We enjoyed our visit here and the domes were well worth going to. Large collections of numerous plant types along with an ecological film show and displays which seem a little at odds with all the construction and reclamation work that has lead to how the Marina area looks today.
"As the time we visited is crowded , we could not went to top floor. But the view is good and the wondering part is everything is human created"
We visited the cloud forest while staying in Singapore. Although it was a little pricey (S$28) it was still a great experience getting right up into the 'cloud' and looking down the waterfall.
Took a young family along to show them what a fantastic walk in this purpose built dome was all about. It didn't disappoint.
"We enjoyed walking round the Cloud Forrest and got some great photos of the waterfalls .You can catch the lift to the top and walk down in amongst all the beautiful plants , we also got some great photos from the top of the marina bay sands."
"I wasn't too sure about this one. It is an amazing structure with a man made indoor waterfall and lookout. There is also a skywalk which is included in the price. There are so many plants in this facility, it is quite amazing. It is definitely worth paying to go into this Dome just to see what can be done!"
Had a really enjoyable visit. Diversity of planting was impressive. Beautifully put together. Lots of emphasis on climate change and the damage humans are doing to the planet. Ironic really as the owners are the exact same company as the Marina Bay Sands hotel complex. No one can truthfully argue that the MBS is environmentally friendly - no way! Very hypocritical. 4-stars for the Cloud Forest. Zero stars for MBS
"I have visited this place few times and my last visit was few days ago.It was a nice atmosphere they have created with the waterfall and nice plants. A completely different atmosphere that anyone would expect considering the outside.I am not a plant enthusiast, but I loved this place. Somehow when I went there it was not very crowded, so it is very peaceful in this place. With the waterfall and the plants, can relax with your loved ones.I think it is better to select a day or time on a weekday, so that there would be less crowd.I recommend this place."
"This is situated at Gardens By The Bay, the dome ""experience"" is really cool and you can learn a lot about nature.I would have liked more information boards so taking off a star for that. But highly recommended!"
There is small man made waterfalls giving out nice cool mist. It requires some walking to see around the Cloud ForestSeems like you get more oxygen in this dome
"We visited in Dec so it was hot and humid in Singapore but as you enter the clouds the temperature drops and we were cold, the clouds are temperature controled. Inside your met with the most beautiful waterfall the structure takes you to the top where you get an amazing view of the bay and the vastness of the cloud. Make sure you give yourself a few hours to enjoy the clouds."
The display was very impressive and a lift is available to get to the top and then wander down. Pick your times as the crowds on the 26th December were horrific.
"The size of this dome is really huge and I amaze by it. There's waterfall too and lost of people enjoy taking photo in there. I enjoy the air because it really cool and refreshing. They made this ""forest"" really good. But I don't think I'll comeback to this place again"
The cloud forest is divided into several levels and as you climb up the type of vegetation changes. Starting from bottom with broad leaf plants to moss and coniferous at the top.There are carnivorous plants for display which I saw for the first time ever. At the entrance there is beautiful misty indoor waterfall.You need to queue to go to the top level by elevator and then can come down viewing each level one by one. Exit is a bit confusing so do ask before coming down.
"The staff were nice and led us to the lifts instead of waiting in the queue since we had two small kids. it can get quite cold inside so best to be prepared.It is beautifully created and well planned, The waterfall was nice to look at.but for me, nothing beats nature"
"We preferred the flower dome to the cloud forest. Although spectacular, particularly the height of the waterfall, the artificiality of it all left a slightly hollow feeling."
"The indoor forest was really impressive, except that the line was too long, understandably because there was a limit to number of persons that walkways could hold."
"It can be a bit hectic at times with queues for tickets, entrance, lifts etc. But it is well organised and the lines move quickly. Well worth it."
"Cloud forest is artificial rain forest in garden by the bay. It has ticket entry.This is multi level park.As you enter ,there is very high fall. Fall reminded me Jurasssik park first scene,as if I am entering a forbidden land.When we move forward there are devoted sections for different rain forest plants.As we move up ,there is better scene of city. However this view does not go well with cloud forest feel.On one floor there are nicely placed and lit natural formation brought from Malaysia cavesIf you are minute observer you can notice pipe and pumps to give that green and wet lookIf you can not go to Amazon rain forest go to cloud forest"
Stunning indoor botanical garden with a large waterfall you can walk up and around. Well worth a visit.
"I've visited Cloud Forest before on my first visit to Singapore and decided to visit it again. I'm glad I did, but I won't be back. Why? Once is enough to see it.There was a long queue to get into the Cloud Forest, and then once you got inside there was another really long queue to get to the lift to take you to the top of the Cloud Forest. I would have happily taken stairs instead of waiting for over 30 minutes inside the Cloud Forest to get the lift to the top, but they ushered you into the queue and there was no option to walk up.There was little to no crowd control / queue management either - lots of people cutting queues and no-one in site to manage the queues.This time, I was in and out pretty quickly, mainly as I'd seen it before and I'd visited the Botanic Gardens the day before where there was so much more to see - and it's free at the Botanic Gardens. Even Mount Faber was nice.The Cloud Forest is a bucket list item for most people visiting Singapore and I do recommend visiting. Then visit the Botanic Gardens for comparison."
"Georgeous gardens which will take you quite a while to look atnincluding discovering hidden sculptures, marvel at the views and beautiful flowers. It cost around $31AUD for entry into two features at the gardens"
"On entering, you will be greeted with a ""waterfall"". Children just love the water mist. You need to go up the lifts to walk along the Tree Top Walk. We almost miss going to the basement where there are plants that have to be kept moist."
A great place to spend time with family . specially in the evening. Lovely view of Singapore .good guiding info on display to recognise landmarks
"After you have seen the flowers, you go into the Cloud Forest, very impressive ad great waterfall with wonderful views"
"Cloud Forest is worth a visit with the high waterfall right at the entrance.Watch out for the beautiful plants and flowers, esp the various types of orchids on the way.Elevator takes you all the way up and you can walk down subsequently. Plenty of scenic photo opportunities."
"We loved visiting the Cloud Forest - a manmade vertical garden and waterfall! If you want to experience something unique and escape Singapore heat, this is the place to go!"
"Wouldn't blame Singapore for building a man-made rainforest waterfall since there are no naturally spectacular waterfalls existing on the island. But if you've been to many great falls around the world, I wouldn't recommend this. If you can get past that, the visit to Cloud Forest is pretty enjoyable. It can get pretty chilly near the waterfalls so bring an extra jacket if needed.I hope we don't destroy our nature that our future of rainforests will be like the ones like Cloud Forest."
This attraction was very unique and beautiful. It was arranged very well and easy for someone with physical disability. You take an elevator to the top then follow the winding path back to the bottom.
Always enjoyed being in the cool cool ambience with rushing waters sound to soothe your soul on a hot hot day ... only snag to the beautiful scene is the fact that the floors can be pretty slippery especially when you have young kids with you ... can be dangerous if you do fall! Perhaps management can look into slip-proofing the ground we step on (just a thought)
Great walk inside lots of water and plants and with a high waterfall the internal walk way is a lot higher than it looks in pictures. Well worth a visit.
Cold and well maintained. Nothing much to say other than the fabulous walk towards nature. Recommended for those who love nature.
This optional extra when you visit the Gardens was good and I would have like more time to look around but I did arrive late. A massive waterfall and it did have a canopy walk that you can view the whole dome from an aerial perspective but the queue was so long that I opted to miss this due to my limited time. Pity.
"InterestingThere's are no animals or birds here like the rainforest in Dubai so you are going to look at flowers. Having said that, they are spectacular especially the orchid walk and the fly traps. It's cool and humid and a pleasant environment if you have been walking around the gardens but there's not much to see after your initial reaction when you step inside."
This is a beautiful garden and feature of Singapore that is truly unique. I enjoyed strolling through and looking at all the elements and interesting aspects of the garden. Definitely worth a visit!
Cloud Forest is situated in Gardens Of The Bay and is worth a few extra dollars to cost whilst you are there. It is absolutely beautiful. The 30 metre high waterfall inside the conservatory is simply stunning. The cool mist inside brought us some welcomed relief from the hot Singapore weather. Just another place to visit that Singapore did so well.
Good educational displays. Most of it is probably lost on the tourists but hopefully not on the local school children.
It's a unique experience where the idea is to experience the cloud as you hike up a mountain. But nothing exceptional about.
this is a truly amazing area to visit as the sights here are amazing. To reach the top and see the sights below in the cloud forest was truly unbelievable
I brought 2 Thai visitors to enjoy this beautiful tourist attraction. We all enjoyed the mist from the waterfall and started our views right from the top. It was a pleasant meandering walk on the bridge from the top down with a lovely view of the Marina Bay Area and the different kinds of foliage on the man made Hill.
"This is one of Singapore tourist attraction, there's two indoor shelter Aircon gardens n outdoor gardens too, with shop n cafe, restaurants n foodcourt, u sure b spoil for choice, n spend a full day here.."
Very Environmentally friendly constructed with beautiful landscaping & greens. It's relaxing as well refreshing just to stroll along the entire place and enjoy the serene environment surrounded by wonderful scenaries.
"A really nice place to see, amazing effort is being put to keep the garden in an amzing shape.Just mind taking a jacket, it is a little cool inside"
Lots of plants around with interesting landscape arrangements on multi-levels. Very realistic simulation of a mountainous area in the wild. Worth going for the experience.
"Once inside you instantly feel a sense of peace as you wander around and take in all the smells, sounds and sights. It is almost like a sensory overload - but in a good way. The gentle climb to the top doesn't require you to be physically fit - but there is an elevator for those that need it, just be prepared to wait as it did have a big queue when we were there. It is hard to believe, whilst surrounded by all the greenery, waterfalls and tropical flowers, that you are in the middle of a large city with skyscrapers as far as the eye can see - such is the scale of the achievement here."
Great to explore! It is something different and everyone should visit at least once. There are concession rates for seniors and children.
Cozy and great place to spend some pleasurable time with the flora of the world. It has been maintained to a high level and the variety available is mind boggling. The environment is also interesting with varied sections which keeps members of every age intrigued. Overall a great experience for all ages
During our visit to Garden by the bay we visited the cloud forest initially. This dome is located a bit of distance from the super grove at garden by the bay. This place requires a quite a lot of walking and also could be crowded during its peek hours. Hence is advisable to arrive early and if you could pre book your tickets itl be more convenient as well.The view of the cloud forest is simply amazing. The view of this indoor water fall surrounded with the beautiful greenery simple takes your breath away. This place could definetly be recommended as a must visit place to any one visiting singapore.
"It is the signature dome visible from the bay area. We visited in the evening. It's nature made closer to us. One has to visit the place to understand the concept. There are entry times, need to check before visiting."
This is sited as a 'must do' for Singapore. Our experience was interesting but probably a bit overpriced for what it is. The cloud forest has lovely plants and a huge waterfall that you can look around and overall it is a nice way to spend around 1/1.5 hours. The best bit for us was the information and videos at the end about climate change. It's very cool inside and for the first time since arriving in Singapore I felt a bit chilly by the time we left. If you want to get out of the heat it's a perfect stop. The attraction could be improved upon by making it larger and perhaps having more reference to the animals that would naturally be found in this habitat.
"Nice to walk around and enjoy the beautiful plant life and construction of the building, quite amazing."
This is one of those places that is mindblowing on first visit and then it just becomes stale like dry bread. Its an alright first experience. Definitely recommended for photo taking
"We did all three of the gardens by the bay. Floral fantasy, flower dome and cloud forest. Cloud forest was my least favorite. Though all three are beautiful in their own right. We spent an entire day there and could have spent a lot longer. The flowers are beautiful and it is air conditioned thankfully but after a full day of walking you are tired."
"The place was beautiful. The indoor waterfall was good, The flower arrangement reminded me of the time I went trekking in a forest. But, best of all, I loved the walkway from the sixth floor downwards which made me feel like I was walking in the cloud watching flowers on the mountainside.A pity it was next to the Flower Dome. It paled in comparison."
"I go there with my friends, there got a lot of places to take photo. All is instaworth spot ;P. waterfall is amazing...."
We initially only visited the outside gardens by the bay and enjoyed that.So the next night we came to see the flower dome and this cloud forest. Both are well worth visiting. Take your camera.
"The cloud forest dome in Gardens by the Bay is a temperature regulated, moderated dome to give the feeling of a rainforest, with a breathtaking waterfall right at the centre. Totally worth a visit!"
A really good way to spend a couple of hours. Great for children too. Lots to see and read. Very informative. I especially liked the information video at the end about global warming- I was disappointed so many people skipped past it. It was a little bit pricy though.
"Whilst it took us a moment or so to adjust to the quite cool temperature, 12yr old and I really enjoyed the experience. So much to look at! Not to sure why but we found it quite calming, surprising the amount of people in the dome. Recommend to all age groups and physical capabilities."
"Getting in here can be a relief from the intense heat of Singapore, you may even feel chilled. The ""cloud forest"" is set in a dome, with an artificial mountain and the ""world's second highest indoor waterfall"", which greets you as you enter the dome. On the ground floor level, there is an interesting collection of plants, particularly thee orchids, some of which are in plastic containers so that you can appreciate their scents. You then have to enter a lift, in order to get to the top of the 'mountain'. There is a good show of epiphytes on the mountain and even some birds to feed on the nectar. In reality, it is not at all like being in a cloud forest, which tends to be much wetter, in my experience. However, as an educational tool, I think it is excellent. There is a lot of information about ecology before you leave the building."
Brilliant piece of thought and execution.A huge rain forest in an air conditioned glass dome with huge vertical gardens and waterfall......ultimateA piece of art literally
An extraordinary jewel in the tourism attractions of singapore! Takes about an hour to visit fully and lifetime memories
"A must for nature lovers and environmental enthusiasts. Perfect specimens of plants, trees and ferns. Impressive architectural design and integration of plants."
Nice place to visit with a very cool waterfall and plants. We waited around for the misting and it's a bit disappointing really.There is a good spot to see the light show for the trees in the garden (if you want to see it from indoors)
If you want to even cool down hope in here for some great views and very cool atmosphere. No need for a guide. Do it yourself easy walk.
I love nature but hate to be in Hot Humid places. So this place solves my problem. I really feel like sleeping overnight there if they would allow sleeping here. Cool & Lovely place to learn more about nature...
"we went there on a Sunday, very crowded, needed to wait for about 30 minutes for the elevator. plants there was beautiful, though i don't quite understand why they have the ""lego"" flower?"
if you are from overseas this will make you feel like home: in an amazing way they created various climate zones inside the dome.
Cloud forest is at Marina Bay and I spent a day here just enjoying the atmosphere. The cloud forest itself can probably be enjoyed in about an hour - it gets busy so try to choose a quieter time so you can relax and enjoy The tranquillity. My favourite part is seeing the sights from the top.
"When I first saw the tacky waterfall, I thought the Cloud Forest might not be my things, but it really is a wonderful space. Clever design - the use of lego was amazing - a massive vertical garden. Loved it."
"Cloud Forrest was brilliant, great look at plants and the waterfall was amazing. Only negative was how extremely busy it was."
This is a lovely tranquil place to visit but there is a fairly long walk. I would suggest that you go very early or late in the day. There is not a lot of shade on pathways to get there.
"If you feel hot walking about singapore, pop into the cloud forest for a climate controlled environment with an arresting waterfall and many floors of amazing foliage. :)"
Beautiful gardens and fauna and a much needed break from the heat. Highly recommended. Got a 2 day ticket for $28 for here and the flower dome. Cloud forest the better of both.
Really enjoyed this attraction. So well put together. Only thing for us was not allowing enough time for the visit.
"There were a huge amount of beautiful displays to look at, there was colour wherever you looked. Loved it!"
The Flower Dome is all laid out for Lunar New Year and a wonderful display of dahlias surrounds the installations.Of course all the diversity and the sculptures and artworks are there and can't be missed by the new visitor. The Chapungu are a series of stone carvings from Zimbabwe which add a dimension of art to Botany. Statues are primarily of birds and people.The sculptures associated with Alice in Wonderland and Pooh Bear are not to be missed also.I have given a selection of images mostly from the New Year installation but be sure to check it all out. I love Gardens by the Bay so much I bought a Friends membership which allows unlimited access all year around.Enjoy!!!
"Great place to enjoy the numerous types of flowers. The theme changes every other month, thus, you can visit this place again and again."
Beautiful indoor garden featuring plants from different parts of the world. Must visit in Singapore.
"The second best feature at Gardens by the Bay, only eclipsed by the Cloud Forest. Like the Cloud forest half of the amazement is the structure and the other half is the content. Where the Cloud Forest structure is more vertical, this one has a shorter angle and a more lateral glass roof for sun to drench an amazing display of plants and flowers. This structure has interesting diversity with so of the driest plant species including trees and some of the most amazing flowers. The flowers is what you come to see here and it does not disappoint, but do not miss the display to the right with trees and cactus, also a great view over the flowers.Again you will send much of your time hear marveling at the plants and the incredible structure that houses them. Don't miss the animal displays made from flowers and plants. Each of them is just as amazing and seasonal."
"Due to the recent torrential rain, we have to change our plans to visit the flower dome. Family and pram friendly place. Be sure to bring a long jacket to keep your little ones warm. The place os well lighted with plenty of spots to take wonderful photos with family. Remember to check and book available slots online before heading over. Due to covid 19, ticketing booths were closed so we have to go over to friends of gardens by the bay to purchase our tickets."
Brilliant string for photography Lighting on the day of my visit was excellentExhibits provide studio - like sets and great colors. There are interring arrangement set on archways that require shooting into strong lightWith tourism non-existent they gardens are not crowded and ticket prices have been reduced
I like that place. whenever my friends are visiting that I will bring them over there!I like the Christmas decorations every year!
Always good to bask in the different themes put up. Quiet and serene with awesome crowd control. Will always come back to this spot monthly!
"This is not the first time to be here in the flower dome. But the first time to see the Sakura exhibition. The experience was nice, and there are more activities than just the Sakura. This seasonal exhibition is a nice activity to do in Singapore."
"Much to see and from all over the world I think. Well marked, easy to navigate trough and fun, even with children because of figures and decoration all over the place"
The day we went there was an exhibition of Tulip flowers. A variety of tulip flowers were there and nicely maintained by the management. The room temperature was cool enough to keep the temperature comfortable for visitors.
We didn't have the opportunity to go inside it. But the exterior design is very good. We thoroughly enjoyed when we went past it.
"Located in the gardens by the bay, entry ticket is mandatory. The African garden, California garden n Australia garden is amazing."
If you like flowers it's well worth a visit. Air conditioned so comfortable for walking. The displays were amazing and a good gift shop.
"I went during the sakura exhibition. Really beautiful flowers in great condition. Together with some japanese architectural installations, it really feels like you're in japan. Pay an additional $20 inside to rent a japanese costume for phototaking! Tickets can be bought onsite"
"We visited this dome at Gardens by the Sea having visited previously about five years ago. On that visit, the highlight feature were orchids. On this visit the highlighted flowers were cherry blossom. Beautiful. Lots of people in that particular area which had lots of photo ops.The dome is more than that one spot, though. There are cacti and succulents, ancient olive trees, baobabs, Australian plants, South African plants, South American plants - the list goes on. Take time to wander through all areas.There were lots of colourful geraniums out when we visited. A common plant where I come from but these were lush and beautifully displayed.Well worth a visit."
If you visit gardens by the bay you must definitely visit this amazing place. One of the largest greenhouse in the world with variation of plants (specially flowers). I visited this place at day time and spent nearly 2 hours.
"If you only have time to visit 1 place at Gardens by the Bay, I recommend the Flower Dome. It is best to allocate half a day to visit all the attractions, ie Flower Dome, Cloud Forest & Floral Fantasy. Currently there is a 50% promotion for Singapore Residents, valid up to 29 March 2020. The ongoing theme is Sakura Matsuri."
"Must visit for flower lovers and highly recommended to everyone! I visited it two times, and they always changed the style of the exhibition, what was very great every time. Totally worth the entry fee. If you are there already, then also dont miss the Cloud Forest nearby."
We visited in the daytime and it was breathtaking but is was even better when illuminated for the night tour
"The Flower Dome is the one time world's largest Greenhouses and display plants from cool dry Mediterranean climate. I've been to a few great greenhouses and botanical gardens, and this is up there with the very best of them. There's an ever changing set of exhibits and currently there is an Alice in Wonderland and a Japanese Gassho style exhibits on display. Both of which are creative and memorable. The rest of the dome is a floral delight of exotic plants and flowers of the aforementioned climates. You should have no trouble finding flowers in bloom worthy of a photo. One of the must-see things in Gardens by the Bay."
"The most recent botanical dome at Gardens by the Bay is just outstanding. Its features enthralled our group of over 70's friends for half a day. There are indoor fountains, fossilized carvings, delicate rain forest frog enclosures, and open glassed viewing walls everywhere we looked. The glass roof soars hundred feet above the entire enclosure. When we fitted our 3 D glasses, and buckled ourselves into the comfy theatre chairs, we were immersed into the world seen by a dragonfly whizzing throughout these very gardens. We felt the spray as we zoomed through the misty waterfalls, and got dizzy as we swooped around giant trees. This 20 minute climax lifted our spirits and enhanced the entire outing. Should you want to see all three domes, allow a full day. Last August we waited till 8 pm to see the coreographed lights and musical fountains displays, but sadly these have been cancelled this time due to the blasted virus . Don't let this stop you roaming all three spectacular .domes."
"Throughout the Flower Dome, sculptures are integrated with the flower displays. Flower displays are segregated by region so for example there is an Australian area and a Japanese garden. On one display, running deer add a sense of motion. Favorites were the flying dragon, La Famille de Voyageurs."
"Not as spectacular but still very worth it. I enjoyed to cactus area - loved the puns of ""aloes in wonderland"" with the Alice in wonderland figures. Very interesting different trees from all over the world."
"Any visitor has to visit this place, the gardens are superb. One tip, as the flower domes are kept at eternal spring the temperature is quite low and we felt cold after being there for so long. I suggest taking something warm and light to slip on."
One of the great experiences of our visit to gardens By the Bay.Beautiful flowers of amazing variety & quite astonishing work here.
Lovely gardens with exhibits for the season with lots of orchids and wooden sculptures. Hint - we thought it might be hot in there but be warned it is air conditioned and quite cold!
We went to the flower drone after many visits to Singapore and not getting past the Satays by the bay food court and actually managed at last to see the flower dome and it was beautiful so many lovely and amazing plants and at night it look so spectacular all light up and so beautiful.withthe light show it is so worth seeing .
Well worth the price of admission on a hot day. And they are all hot. Here is a special and often whimsical arboretum that all ages will enjoy wandering through.
"It is said to be the largest glass greenhouse in the world and listed in the 2015 Guinness World Records. The climate inside the Flower Dome is a replica of the cool dry Mediterranean climate. Flowers from various parts of the world like South Africa, Central Chile, California, South West Australia and Mediterranean basin, are grown in the Flower Dome.A lot of beautiful flowers but couldn't really stop to enjoy since it's so packed. Would suggest going during the non peak hours. I recommend that you head here first before going into the Cloud Forrest, simply because the wow factor that could be lost a little bit if headed here last."
"walking through the avenues of plants , trees and shrubs obtained from many parts of the world to showcase nature , giving us the opportunity to see floral beauty of orchards , chrysanthemum show as part of Chinese new year celebrations , truly delightful"
"Once again another magical experience visiting this spectacular soaring glass green house. This greenhouse is home to numerous plants and flowers from the semi-arid and Mediterranean regions of the world. What captivated as the most was that during our November visit, the flower dome was transformed into a northern alpine setting and lavishly decked out with Christmas decorations and plants. Beautiful Christmas scenery, santa workshops and Nordic pines and trees, enchanting snow scenery, sleigh with reindeers and other whimsical animated creatures.. It is truly a wonderful experience especially in a tropical climate. I am sure that there are numerous themes that the Flower Dome adapts to throughout the season. An amazing tour even without the seasonal themed decor."
"Flower Dome is the biggest glass greenhouse in the world. It is shaped like a butterfly when looked down from above. It is probably the coolest place in the entire country, both temperature-wise and fun-wise. Once inside the dome, it's hard to put your phone or camera down. The different species of flowers from different parts of the world are in various sizes, shapes, and colours. They are all very lovely and pretty. One can easily spend two hours enjoying the beauty of nature inside the Flower Dome."
"Wonderful place to visit, exhibitions well maintained, housed in a spectacular piece of architecture some of the best gardens we've seen"
excellent variety of flowers. it was beyond beautiful to see and smell so many flowers under one roof.
"The Flower Dome is a large greenhouse filled with a gallery of plants, trees and of course, flowers from all over the world. It is quite busy, but it's gorgeous!!"
My husband did not want to see flowers but was very surprised when we entered. Loved the paths around the different types og gardens.
"a large variety of trees and flowers from all over the world, smartly combined to make a beautiful effect, with higher passarele to see the big picture of the Dome"
"The fact that they replant plants and make new displays all the time seems very time consuming but it is cool. The plants from all around the world, the beautiful roses and the sculptures around just amazing."
We really enjoyed visiting the Flower Dome. It felt peaceful and magical. We loved all the exotic flowers and trees from around the world and enjoyed the art pieces amongst the plants. well worth doing.
Very interesting well worth a visit. Refer to report given on the tourist attraction - Gardens By The Bay
Flower Dome gives you an array of beautiful flowers and plants from all over the world. Best combine it with Cloud Forest
We were fortunate enough to be here around the Christmas holidays and the displays were simply breathtaking!
"I always drop by the Flower Dome whenever they have new exhibits on display.For this month of January 2020, it is Dahlia dreams (with Lunar New Year Festivities).I can only sum it up as this is THE place you want to be at, during this hot weather.The horticulturists and botanists likely did the right combination this time, with a good mix of flora and festive sculpture displays, like the 12 Chinese Zodiac signs.Each of the displays are so cute and adorable, no matter if you view them during the day or evening night.Think the only slight blemish is that there were only two guided tour groups at 11am and 3pm on weekdays.I actually attended one where I was the only guest!But the guided tour was informative and gave me more information on the displays and the significance.Strongly recommended for tourists (especially first timers) to Singapore!Tip: if you can spare time to come back within the same day, please do remember to ask the staff at the exit for a re-entry stamp.The last entry is 8.30pm at night."
"I couldnot believe at first that in one place how these much of flowers could be planted and grown . Very well maintained and decorated. And the visit is on christmas , the lightings and xmas tree decorations are awesome."
"If you have the choice I would choose the flower dome. Initially not as spectacular, however you can spend more time there because there is so much to see"
WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE.So beautiful. Every time I went there it was a different display. Lovely and cool inside.
"Blissful morning spent in the flower dome, it was a must do on our visit to Singapore and didn't disappoint.It was a bargain Â£16 to visit both here and Cloud Forest. The flowers were amazing and cleverly organised into regions of the world"
If you were blind and went into this place your nose would explode. I can imagine people with allergies might have a problem in here. It's just as big and beautiful as the cloud forest except there is no waterfall. We got to it late and only had an hour before it closed so we had to rush and we were already tired from walking in the gardens and cloud forest. Its beautiful at night but I would recommend going there first in the daytime then return at night to see it.
This place is always in superb shape. The entrance fee is more than justifiable. Never get bored of coming here.
A great place for the whole family. Most impressing display of flowers. Stunning colours of different spices of flowers and beautiful ornaments. The place gets crowded. Early visit is recommended. I am not a gardener or expect in plants and flowers but I enjoyed the sheer beauty of the dome interior and display of fresh flowers.
A good couple of hours happily spent walking throughout the DOme checking out all the various plant life inside and hunting for the wooden sculptures around the area. Paths gentle and well spaced. Did not seem as crowded as I had expected. Well worth a visit.Very cool inside against the heat of the day.Roof not a magnifying glass as i had thought it might be.
This place was so beautiful!! Well worth the money. Be sure to visit all of the gardens. There are some which are free. If you are there at Christmastime don't miss out on the winter wonderland music light show and festivities. It was a highlight. They even made it snow!
"It is definitely worth the entrance price. You can either buy a ticket for each of the three attractions or a combination of two or three of them. The Flower Dome, the Cloud Forest and I don't remember the third one. Buying a combination of three entitles you to use the shuttle service running inside the gardens. You can still avail of the shuttle without this, but by buying a ticket each time you want to use the shuttle.As with the Super Tree grove I don't have much to say about the attraction. It is really beautiful. We were on a trip by ourselves for the first time in 18-20 years. The kids have now grown up enough to travel by themselves or be left at home. We spent a couple of hours inside the Flower dome just walking around looking at the various displays. No hassling kids, no hunger pangs, no toilet breaks.But please be aware that going on a weekend will mean that there are a whole lot of girls/women who work in Singapore who come here for a picnic and will be taking selfies at every possible point in the dome. Walking around can be a bit tricky, avoiding photo bombing will need to be a skill you'll need to learn quickly.Am posting a few photos of the place, instead of saying anything much about the attraction itself."
The dome itself is quite spectacular and provides a wonderful setting for an extensive range of flora. We found the cacti and succulents particularly interesting with some unusual specimens which I don't recall seeing in Kew. There were some ancient olive trees with interesting gnarled bark and some very impressive massive dahlias.
The flower garden is an amazing place to visit with it's displays and scents gives the eye a visual treat.
It is a really spectacular construction of the world. Millions of plants are here. You do not need to go many places to see.
"The Flower Dome is a must see in Singapore, and best thing to do is get the combined ticket with the Cloud Forest.The Flower Dome is set out with various display sections for different countries (e.g. Australia, America) and different types of plants e.g. succulents and herbs.They've usually got a themed display down on the bottom level depending on what time of year it is - I went at Christmas time and they had a great Christmas display.Well worth the entry to visit."
"This is my favorite place to go for macro-photography of flowers, especially as a beginner. There's no wind to disrupt focusing the lens, except that you have to content with the number of visitors. I can spend almost three hours here each time. In fact every visitors would leave with many photos on their phones or cameras clamoring for a good shot here and there.There is also a cafe inside this place. Very cosy and relaxing for a cup of coffee/tea, or for some reflections in a 'flowery' environment. There is also a big function hall that seem open for corporate booking. The variety of plants/flowers amazes you and there is so much to learn or admire at the beauty of nature."
I advise going here first before Cloud Forest. The Flower Dome is simply a collection of plants from many countries. I believe they regulate the climate and humidity to make it similar to countries in sub-tropical region. The place is beautifully designed. Must visit here if you ever go to Garden by the Bay. Come here first before the Cloud Forest because the latter is even better.
Flower Dome and Cloud forest are favourite place to bring tourists. My friends from overseas enjoy and love the place. It's a place where I won't get sick of myself. Beautiful flowers and environment
"What does not grow here does not exist on Earth (well ...). An attempt to recreate large parts of the botanical world, gathered in one place with educational guidance. May personally think that is the best example I have seen and experienced so far. Well-maintained, beautiful, content-rich, comprehensive, educational, exciting, interesting and important from an educational point of view. Especially at a time when the climate and environment are becoming more reminiscent and we all need to reflect on what is important in life and important to our planet. If you 'just' want to see and experience ten things in Singapore, this is definitely one of them!"
One ticket for this and the forest - great value. Bautiful layout with many little surprises hidden in the displays - keep your eyes open. Smashing restaurant inside with excellent range of snacks and meals.
Gardens are very well done. You see plants that probably will never see in an air conditioned dome. The paths and movement directions are well co-ordinated and take a lot of selfies
"A must - go - place in Singapore.Many beautiful trees and flowers, good decoration. They have new event every 3 months, so you should come back ofen. I came near Chrismast, it is good."
Twenty Singapore dollars for a single admission ($15 US) is a good price for this beautiful indoor exhibit at the Gardens by the Bay. It is expansive and you could easily spend a couple of hours strolling amidst the manicured plant exhibits and special displays.
"This optional extra place to visit is a great addition of the Gardens by the Bay complex. It is divided into geological areas such as Australian, South American, etc We visited during the lead up to Christmas so this was reflected in certain displays as well."
"If you are into gardening and would like to see how to set out plantings especially of not so common plants and trees this is the place to viist.The succulent garden is wonderful, as is the Australian Garden.The lower garden area was themed as a Christmas Garden with all the plants and decorations.,"
Beautiful gardens of different regions on show. Many had Christmas exhibits . Stunningly Beautiful. I could have stayed there all day.
"Kudos to the designers who put together this huge collection of flowers in a man made air conditioned dome. The keywords here are huge collection and air conditioned. I cannot imagine the number of hours of design time that must have gone in to arrange the flowers within the dome for us to meander in leisure. Of course the part I enjoyed most is the air condition especially after a hot day wandering around the outdoor gardens, this is definitely a place to plan at the end of your trip to the Gardens by the Bay!We were also very lucky to come just in time for the cherry blossoms displays.Allow about an hour or so, depending on your attraction for flowers."
"Huge varieties of exotic & beautiful plants & flowers from all over the world in one place. Most people probably never get to see most of such unusual plants & flowers in their lifetime.Admire & view them in cool air-conditioned comfort.Not sure if there is another place like this in the world. This being CNY, added theme props adds colour to the place.Sadly though due COVID, this usually tourists- packed attraction is quiet, with some local visitors."
"Had a lovely time with my girlfriend at night to see the Christmas decorations and it was definitely quite lovely to see all the night lights. However, some portions of the flower dome is quite dimly lit so you cannot appreciate the beauty and colours of the flowers as well as during the day. So definitely go during the day to see the flowers but stick around till night to see the Christmas lights."
Any time of the day can visit Flower Dome as it roofed. Don't worry about rain or sun. Attached photos are Flowers can be seem during the September time. Take your time to enjoy the flowers of the season.
"Closed up look to the beautiful flowers in flower dome singapore.Very cool environment ,makes your mood happy because of the flowers"
"Last visit here was in March 2020 before everything closed down for the lockdown. But it was quite a nice time to visit as there were very few other people inside, and unlike the cloud forest there are regular changes in the flowers on display. We have our annual passes so it's always enjoyable to come in here and escape the heat outside."
It's surprisingly chilly in the Flower Dome so take a jacket for your own comfort. We were lucky enough to go around here during Chinese New Year and the intricate flower artwork was stunning. There are beautiful displays of succulents and cacti on multilevel platforms.The floor surface and lifts would allow easy access for wheelchairs/ trolleys.
Went there on 22 mar and was pleasantly surprised to find lesser crowds and beautiful sakura flowers on display. There are also Japanese yukatas for rent during this period. Will definitely go again.
"Dont missed the desert part of the dome, it is fantasic and well impressed. the major part of the flower garden is not interest at all."
well worth the money and time spent here. such an array of plants. a lot of cacti in the gardens but if you have time it is a great walk and sight.
"I enjoyed the flower dome although personally I preferred The Cloud Forest. If you've never been before, buy a combo ticket which allows entry to both domes."
Great place to cool down in the afternoon. Lots of interesting plants and flowers in a magnificent building.
Honestly I loved how beautiful the flowers were and such interesting plants like the succulents and the hairy looking cactus.. please excuse my lack of knowledge as I went with my toddler who was mesmerized without me having to read the names and descriptions out. BUT a tad too many stairs for me to carry my toddler around. Better to go cloud dome if you are with smaller kids. This is better for teenagers!
We purchased the combo ticket that included the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. But I preferred the Cloud Forest though.Indoor garden great to avoid either the heat of sunny day or pouring rain outside.
"I purchased the combo ticket that included the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest for a price of $28 SGD. The Flower Dome is very colourful inside, there are flowers and plants from all over the world, each area is unique to a specific region in the world. A worthy note, the Flower Dome is the largest glass greenhouse in the world, you have to see it to believe it!"
"Not quite as good as the Cloud Dome but still worth a visit. Set out in different zones from around the world including Mediterranean and Australia. Ticket queues can be a bit slow, so would recommend buying in advance."
This is next to Cloud forest while visiting the Gardens by the Bay. It has all sorts of flowers belonging to different regions.I would prefer cloud Forest first if i am running short of time
This is worth buying a ticket for with the Cloud Dome as they are next to each other. It is lovely to walk around and the displays are pretty. We were there when they were starting to set up for Chinese New Year but all the Christmas displays were still in there.
"This is mainly about the mediterranean climate areas around the world. In addition, there is a small section that changes with the time of year (was Xmas theme in early January). The orchid section was small and crowded. Most areas have few flowers. Buy the combined dome ticket. Took about an hour to see."
"Been there, done that, won't go back. Pretty flower display. Not very exciting nor awe inspiring, unlike Cloud Forest."
"Been here at 4pm-6pm so I can enjoy this garden from natural green color and mix it with lots of lights. The place was really good too, like cloud forest but this one focus on flowers and all. I really like cactus section because I don't really into flowers. You can take so many good picture here."
"We have visited this place twice and both the times it had a different theme setup. Both were beautiful and colorful.Inside the dome there are trees, various plants with beautiful flowers and cactuses for display."
We were there at Christmas so the Flower Dome had it's Christmas displays out. A great display! Our favourite was the cloud dome though.
"The Dome is well laid out with a good range of flora set in gardens from around the world including Australia, South Africa, Southern Europe etc. Some extremely old olive tree were of particular interest."
"This is beautiful full of flowers from around the world in different sections. It's worth visiting but we came in here AFTER the Cloud dome...and we felt the cloud one was more impressive, I would still come here, but maybe visit here first. Its really cool....very colorful, easy to get around....in an amazing structure!"
So much to see here and amazing colours. Hard to believe you are in a dome. Well organised and to the Cloud experience
It was a little pricey to get in. And I expected it to be super hot and humid but it was real comfortable. I walked around and looked at the flowers. It took about an hour. It was pretty nice and different from anything I've seen before.
"Visited this attraction during the Christmas season and it was just a delight. I've never seen so many poinsettias in one place in my life! I loved the Christmas displays and the beautiful flowers organised in different gardens e.g Australian garden, Mediterranean garden etc.Definitely worth a visit. Don't expect this to be a Botanical garden to see rare floral species. Rather, this is a beautifully arranged air conditioned dome with flowers. It literally is a flower garden.Thoroughly pleasant."
It is a must see in Singapore! That's it! Beautiful and amazing! Never seen something like that before.
"Impressive combination of nature, architecture and art in Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, but something was missing... real birds. Instead there were Christmas decorations in December completely not matching interior design..ImponujÄca kombinacja przyrod Forest i Flower Dom, ale czegoÅ mi brakowaÅo... prawdziwych ptakÃ³w. Za to w grudniu byÅa wystawka ÅwiÄteczna kompletnie nie pasujÄca do caÅoÅci zaÅoÅ¼enia."
There are different areas and plants around every corner and it was also interesting to see the different artwork that was added to each display. Something for everyone.
I acted as tourist guide for 2 Thai visitors and had a lovely time. The Christmas decorations were out and it's beautiful to see the decorations among the beautiful flowers. We enjoyed the cold in the whole Dome.
"The Flower Dome in Gardens by the Bay did not 'wow' me, maybe because I didn't pay extra for the audio tour headset. At around $20 for admission I feel like that should be included. The displays of Mediterranean gardens from Africa, California and elsewhere were interesting but unless you're a true botanist - or take the audio tour which would have probably made it more interesting ' it wasn't fascinating. BUT, the 'Poinsettia Wishes' Garden Trail special exhibit made it worthwhile. A clever, creative and charming floral display in honor of Christmas features 'Nisse,' a little gnome from Scandinavia and his gnome friends and reindeer. Combined with the Christmas music playing in the background it was quite enjoyable."
"This is well worth a visit. The dome itself is worth looking at on its own merits. The mixture of plants and statues is very well done. Various levels gives you great views of all the plants. Great views to be had looking out of the dome and on to the Singapore skyline. Beautifully air conditioned, which is always welcome."
We visited after the Cloud Forest and it was beautiful. Lots of flowers and great photo opportunities.
With so many flowers and plants from all corners of the globe the colours and smells are an amazing example of what is good in this world. A slow walk through the numerous displays will leave you inspired and believing you can achieve the impossible in your own little corner back home.
We visited the flower dome during our visit to Garden by the bay. This dome is located near by the cloud forest dome and its definetly worth a visit. This dome has beautiful flowers and unique art work sculptures made with wood. The flower dome is a must visit to everyone who loves to enjoy the view of beautiful flowers.
I went during the rhoderdendron display & was mesmerized by the colours. Beautifully displayed & made me want to rush out & buy some for my own garden! The garden rooms with plant habitats from around the world were beautiful. Lots of good places to sit & enjoy the views. I especially liked the sculptures crafted from sticks & other pieces of wood.
"I came into the dome feeling very overwhelmed by all the flowers in it. It is really beautiful and almost magical. They keep the dome pretty cool probably because of the plants and flowers.The flowers were so so beautiful. Almost with every kind of plants and flowers, I just had to stop and take pictures of it. It was very lovely.Although, this wouldn't be a good place to go if you're allergic to flowers or plants."
"The sheer amount of flowers and trees here is just crazy. It is very beautiful, well-maintained and just lovely to be here. Staff clearly put a lot of effort into maintaining this.We enjoyed our time here but must say it's not our favourite. The little alley with the most beautiful flowers got very crowded due to a lot of visitors stopping to take pictures every couple of metres. And we haven't even visited at peak times. Despite that it really is something you should see when visiting Singapore and I would recommend it to everyone."
"Very popular, this is the Flower dome, however I still prefer the Cloud ForestTickets can be purchased outside for the Cloud and Flower Domes. There was a queue, and I would recommend buying tickets from other ticket booths as you arrive to the park, e.g. from the MRTThe temperature inside is perfect and the flower displays are spectacular. The displays change depending on what is being shown. We has the Rhododendrons on display in one of the sections.It is both pushchair and wheelchair friendly, but can get very busy and crowded.The only offputting for me was those inconsiderate visitors who wanted selfies with each display or wanted family photographs as they went around blocking the walkways.Worth a visit - fully recommended"
Lovely place makes anice break from the heat and very interesting as well. Definitely one for the list of must sees.
"We had gone to gardens by the bay the night before, without going here.We certainly are glad we went back to see the 2 domes. It's a bit of a walk so take the inexpensive shuttle if you can.The flower dome is just packed with variety's from all over the world grouped in regions.Very impressive structure from the outside and spacious inside.Lots of girls posing for photos amount the flowers, very Asian.Well worth the visit. Take in the cloud forest also"
"The Flower Dome in the Gardens by the BAy is a gigantic, air-conditioned glass greenhouse, showing some of our own floral and other exotic plants and gardens featuring plants from countries like Australia and other semi arid places.From 27th to 28th October the varied varieties of Rhododendrons is displayed and a worthy visit. A definite must for seniores as every first Tuesday of the month, the entry fee is waived.Much effort had been put into the exhibition with adorable bears adorning the display. One would be taken aback by the fusion of colours abound and be amazed by the varieties from the different countries.I was surprised to learn the difference between azaleas and rhododendrons!Another interesting features for SInagporeans especially, is the row of miniature apple trees , laden with apples planted along the side of the walkway.Do go for the exhibition if you want to feast your eyes on the radiance of the rhododendrons!"
"On a hot day this is a place to visit. Plenty of flowers and photo spots. There are a lot of people but angle it properly, you can get some nice photos."
"Not sure if there is a best time to visit as this is always busy, but never overcrowded. Great variety of plants and interest in the different country areas"
"They arrangements of the flowers along with the sectioned African, Australian and other plant collection areas are simply superb! This is one place for the pictures - at each step! Make sure to have enough space in your cameras :)"
"This large 'biodome' houses plants and flowers from around the world. It is large enough to contain specimens of a variety of trees, such as Baobab trees. It is very ambitious by trying to cover so many different environments but seems to have produced exhibits that bring the 'flavour' of their home countries. Like so many parts of Singapore, orchids get a lot of attention, with some particularly splendid exhibits to show them off. I particularly liked the way the sculptures have been incorporated in the displays."
Cool surrounding with bright fresh flowers from top to ground level . A nice stroll with very refreshing decors . Love it and a must-see for all.
"It's a nice closed small botanic garden not too full of people when we've been there. Love the flowers, especially orchids. Area is divided by different part of world and at the entrance you have more of the fairytale part of it connected to Alice of Wonderland. If you have time see it if no skip and go to Cloud Forest as is in my opinion better"
I had the time so I toured both the cloud forest and flower dome. The flower dome was full of colour and overall was a pleasing place to spend and couple of hours!
Extensive and beautiful flowers but very crowded on a Sunday afternoon. Not many places to sit for rest. Cloud Forest more impressive.
But it's a fantastic place to people watch. I could sit there all day in the air con and watch people taking selfies with plants.
"Inlove with these beautiful flower dome. An amazing array of orchids, a thousand old olive tree, and unusual Baobabs! I will definitely come back and recommend to my family and friends."
Visited the flower dome well worth a visit whilst in Singapore.Went to both they are right next to each other.Good to visit in the afternoon the hottest part of the day in Singapore and make sure you stay to watch the light show near by at 7.45.One hour will be sufficient to see each dome.My only complaint would be all the selfie sticks I think they should be banned as some people make you wait while they take 5 minutes to take a photo of themselves.
If You like Flower this place is right place for you to take picture with flower but not good if full of people because you can't enjoy this place
"Took the grand kids to this venue, first stopping at the cloud forest, which they loved to run around in the misting that took place, and trying to get close to the waterfall much to their mums concern. The carnivorous plants warning children will be eaten slowed them down though! We went up into the flower dome, and were delighted by all th trees from various countries, and the massive display of flowers, the beds looking a treat and worthy displays of Singapore's finest orchids that even the kids liked. Although the tree dragon, and various animals made out of dried tree branches kept the little ones interested while the adults appreciated the colourful arrangements. The purple gorilla caught their attention as well, popular photo shoot that one. In fact, you cannot stop taking photo after photo, it just gets to you and you want to remember it.Dont forget to ask for your free gift as you buy your entrance ticket, you will get a pack of souvenir cards that you can send to the rellies to make them jealous, or keep them yourself as a memento of a great day. If a 6 and a 4 year old both enjoy it, then it was a good day all round!"
"Not as impressive as Cloud Forest, however definitely worth seeing if only for Orchid display. With hundreds of orchids in an array of colours this a must see!"
"The flower dome is full of amazing plant life, colourful vegetation, and picturesque views. This is a lovely place to take pictures in Singapore, and has the cleanest air we have breathed since coming to Asia! There are plants from all over the world, and the dome is laid out nicely with trails, and views. The only downside is the price of this attraction which costs $20 (for one dome) and $28 if you are doing the cloud forest dome as well (which is in fact much cooler!)"
The visit to the flower dome was lovely with spectacular gardens representing various regions on Earth. Well worth the visit if you enjoy plants and gardens.
"Perhaps a little overshadowed by the neighbouring Cloud Forest, but a delightful place to visit nevertheless. Contained within the dome is a visual feast of flora from areas around the world. Of especial interest was the very large and absolutely delightful collection of varying cacti species. This alone makes a visit all the worth while. Another standout attraction was the scent garden, where visitors are encouraged to enchant themselves with the smell of various orchids.Hidden among much of the flora are alluring sculptures, many of these being made of natural tree vegetation, and unlike their real wildlife forms, are more than willing to be photographed, which you will probably find yourself doing with considerable frequency."
Good collection of habitats and plants and some excellent sculptures. We were lucky enough to be there for a rose display which was colourful and fragrant. Worth a visit.
"This is part of the Gardens by the Bay complex. Both offer a very relaxing, beautiful and serene setting to spend 2-3 hours and at the same time get out of the extreme heat and humidity. In fact you may want to bring a light jacket because the Cloud Forest ( that is adjacent to the Flower Dome) is very cool at all times. There are other things to do at Gardens by the Bay but these two are the highlights. You need to buy separate tickets for both locations and are right next to each other."
"Once you step in , you will love the place.Full of various flowers.Visited in the evening hence the atmosphere was fantastic.Some flower plants I have seen for the first time.If you are nature lover,you will like the place.Somewhat crowdy place.I like this dome as compared to cloud forest dome"
"Interesting installation that changes every season. Always something new to look forward to, especially the temperate plants (tulips, begonias, roses, alpine, etc.) in a hot and humid tropical city."
"Cool place with various flower from around the world, If you like flower photography this place is recommend."
"It is a nice green house are developed in a park nearby the Bay Area in Singapore. If you like flowers, you can enjoy the time of your visit. You can enter the Flower Dome by buying a ticket which is combined with the Dome of Cloud Forest. The Flower Dome is a large area to host different types pf flowers such as cactus familia, orchids, and roses."
It was an interesting place to wander (and to get away from the heat) but it was VERY busy when we went which really detracted from the overall experience. The Cloud Forest is more interesting in my opinion.
"Hello traveller!This place is well kept, clean and has done a pretty good job at making plants and flowers grow well indoors! You can see a lot of effort is taken to maintain the plants in excellent condition. It's worth a visit!""Beyond the stars, under the sea - all you seek to see is right here in you right now."" J. H."
"This huge greenhouse offers wonderful various settings of gardens from all over the World, from Mediterranean to desert. It is combined with the visit of the Cloud Forest within Gardens on the Bay."
"This was my first visit to the Flower Dome despite living in Singapore, and I was expecting much, as many friends had raved about it. However, I did not find it very impressive. No doubt there are lots of varieties of plants and flowers, and I guess you would like it if you like plants. And of course, you can enjoy the place in the cool air-conditioned environment."
"To be honest with the amount of greenery in Singapore, this one was disappointing. Besides battling with a large Indian tour group and several ignorant couples dominating by endlessly pushing past and monopolising to take photo after photo of the wife posing, the displays werent really that good especially when compared to the Cloud Dome and the Flower festival near the entrance."
Has a lot of beautiful exotic flowers from all over the world but nothing too great to boast about. Entrance fee is quite expensive.
"We visited this place few days ago.There are many flowers in this place for a ""Flower lover"". I was bit tired when I entered this place, but soon after entering, all the ""tiredness"" wiped out.Humid atmosphere in this, but it is a comfortable level.I think this is a good place to visit, specially for tourists like us."
"If you come here right after cloud forest, you might find this place underwhelming. The flowers are really not spectacular. Maybe would only recommend this to a person who LOVE horticulture."
"This place is very cool, unique and something you must visit. Praise aside, this wasn't for me and I'm not sure why."
"The entry to Gardens by the Bay includes both Flower Dome & Cloud Forest.The latter one is more interesting, while Flower Dome display flowers in many countries. However, normally flowers are not that attractive and colourful during winter, therefore apart from Christmas flowers, all others are dull."
"I wasn't impressed! I've heard it is awesome, but I guess it depends on the season. This time ( November/December) they have almost same plants which are shown in the other dome. Now they have there a small Christmas theme display with poinsettias."
"We visited the Botanical and Orchid gardens before visiting the Flower dome and Cloud Forest. I would advise people to skip the domes. The tickets for the domes are expensive and after seeing the Botanical and Orchid gardens, we were not impressed by the domes. They seemed small and not unique."
We visited this after going to the Cloud Dome and it lacked the structure as there was no clear route through it. It seems to have exhibitions featuring a particular flower type. We walked around the same bits more than once and I'm sure missed other bits because of no clear route and I didn't think the flower displays were particularly great.
Beautiful display of perfect specimens from around the globe in different sections. A must for flower enthusiasts. Pretty and past the time for those just out for a few hours. Lots of thought and planning placed into the presentation of the flower dome.
"A great range of plants and flowers from around the globe. Admission was $28 pp for entry into the 2 domes. It was nice too see however not something I would put on the top of my list for things to see in Singapore, just my personal experience."
"Nicely done, but I'm from the UK, and apart from all the cacti, most of the plants weren't that exotic! The Eden project in the UK had more tropical plants!"
Nice. But too crowded in the way it is designed. Certainly the cloud forest dome is more spectacular and less crowded as flow is one direction. Give this dome a miss unless you have a spare hour.
I think this should be improve because of the green of the dom. Limited flower planning with a few corner in the garden. 5 or 6 area that you can make picture shoot.
"I visited the place today but feel a bit sad because if you see through some corner in the garden, many flowers has dried planning and it seem that no one take care the planning. The top roof is amazing and if you look around, there are only orchid flower seem ok. But they are ok because this trees can live a hard weather. So, what can make this area become green as called name flower dom?"
"If you are a proper plant nut, then you will really appreciate this. But the average person will probably enjoy the Cloud Forest better"
"I was surprised that this huge a place is airconditioned. You will be comfortable while going around the dome's nooks and secret gardens. I must say it is impressive though, but i was not contented cause there are not much flowers to see...there are no tulips, sunflowers, the big and brightest flowers which i expect to see. I am not familiar with flower names but what I saw were small flowers only. However i must say that the garden will give you a good feeling that you're in a paradise."
"I bought a combi ticket for around 20eur which provides access to both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. No need to make an advanced reservation. The Flower Dome is nice for a short stroll, but is not so impressive as the Cloud Forest. I had a combi ticket, but if you would have to make a choice in between one of the two domes, go for the Cloud Forest."
"We visited just before Christmas & we really enjoyed the different areas inside - the cactus garden, Californian area, mediterranean, etc. It's also nice to be in a comfortable temperature & also being sheltered from tropical downpours. However there was a large area of Tsum tsum Christmas village inside. Now we're big Disney fans - but didn't appreciate the Tsum tsum circus inside the flower dome to such a large extent - it just didn't seem right."
"My partner and I visited the cloud forest and flower dome on the same day. We arrived early to avoid crowds which worked well for the cloud forest however we loved it in the first dome so much that by the time we visited the flower dome it was packed!Still beautiful non the lessHowever the cloud dome had more information and interactive boards with information for those walking around. The information on flower types in the flower dome was minimal, most only displaying scientific names of each- some cool ""dis you know or interaction with the flowers would have been appreciated.The cloud forest had a bunch of rare plants, some sniffing orchard experience etc which the flower dome could of included to spice up the experience for costumers."
It smells lovely and must be pretty in the daytime. We went in the evening after dark so were less impressed. But worth a tour anyway.
"The flower dome is one of the two domes in Gardend by the Bay. You only can buy a combination ticket. After the spectacular cloud forest dome this one seemed small and poor. They had a rose show going on, but every European has more roses in his garden than they have in their show. Endy Julv 14th, 2019. It is nice to walk through the flower dome, but in 30 mins You are done."
"Nice place for pictures (get your perfect Instagram moment), especially during the afternoon. Great variety of plants and flowers from all over the world ' however should take water bottle with you. Mainly for horticulture enthusiasts though."
I guess this is a nice place and is quite crowded.Went here with my family and was out of there within 30 minutes.I would have done something else instead of going here.
"We bought 2 adult tickets and 2 child tickets for flower dome and cloud forest together from glook. It's not easy as you need to redeem the physical tickets from the reddot museum which is about 15 mins walk distance. However, the tickets were sold under terms and conditions that we need to use each ticket on the same day. The day we went, the cloud forest happen to be closed, so, we missed our chance to go in and it was a waste of money."
no plastic flowers here. this is what i imagined where plum fairies live. it is cool and well ventilated. i want to bring my mother here on mothers day. do not buy souvernirs! the entrance fee to the cload forest and flower dome is expensive. you can find cheaper souvernirs that looks the same in chinatwn and lucky plaza
Nicely built flower dome.it has variety of flowers and quite big enough.nicely maintained and kept...
"Flower dome was a disappointment, may be because Iam not a flower person. We visited Flower Dome after Cloud Forest, if we did it the other way around then the flower dome would have managed to score a bit. But if you see Cloud forest and then flower dome it fails to leave an impression."
"Cooled place (I was suprised how those warmth-loving flowera survive in this dome) so the ppace where you can cool off. No drinking or eating inside allowed, but there are toileta. I would say that this place thinks about tourists. A lot of nice places to take pictures at."
"Same with Cloud Forest, this attraction is also amazing since the floral life can be seen blooming and spreading love all over the place and among its visitors.I'm so glad that during the time we visited this place, they had an exhibit which showcased the tulips of Amsterdam.Overall, this was a nice experience to live by.A good family activity.Entrance fee is required. We bought ours together as a bundle with Cloud Forest."
"Overall good experience but probably we visited at the wrong time. it was damm crowded and kids were very tired byt the time we reached to the top. We took nearly 1.5hr to reach top but once we reach top, the view was very good especially in the evening they switched on the shower and it was quite good to view that."
There are certainly a lot of beautiful floral arrangements in the Flower Dome - there are sections for plants / flowers from all over the world. Lovely to see so many different varieties of flowers and display for optimum viewing - a lot of good photo opportunities!If you are short on time - I would recommend seeing the Cloud Forrest over the Flower Dome as there are more unique features in the Forrest.
"Because going to Japan is very expensive, I went to see the Sakura showcase here. When I went the flowers are starting to wilt already so I didnt enjoy much."
We weren't very impressed even though there were a few pretty gardens and statues. As The entrance ticket is for the amazing cloud forest too I recommend taking a peek.
"Ok for a quick visit, although I felt it was a little over priced and thought the cloud forest was better. Was a good way to escape the heat from outside as it is air conditioned inside :) It is just full of plants from all around the world. Interesting if you are into that sort of thing."
"They have managed to keep a wide variety of species from all over the world in one location, giving a very pretty place for you to wander about. Inside is the Pollen cafe, and during December they will have Christmas-themed decorations. One ticket usually covers both the cloud forest and flower dome."
Preferred the cloud dome but this was pretty cool too. Nice temperature inside. Learnt a bit about plants from all over.
We visited the flower dome in november and it was not very colourfull. Not very interesting. The cloud forest is worth a visit.
I really enjoyed the displays here five years ago but at present (December 2018) there's an enormous Christmas display that is just a bit tacky to my taste and takes up a lot of space - little kids seemed to love it but we adults were disappointed. Do the Cloud Dome instead at the moment!
We paid 28 dollars to visit this and the cloud forest. I had expected a hige display of colour and was very disappointed. It all seemed sparse with mostly greenery. There was a large area dedicated to christmas with plastic looking toys. I would not have paid to go in if i had known.
"not the best of the two domes, I found this dome a little too staged for me. The planting was pretty average too."
"I have mixed feeling about it. It was vey Christmasy and for kids. I loved some part of it and some I did not. Go with children but if you are short of time, go somewhere else."
"Another good attraction in Singapore, albeit a bit repetitive with the same plants and flowers. This is still worth and a welcome break from the humidity. If you are a keen gardener then this is right up your street."
"Rather limited range of areas and flowers and trees. A South African, South American , succulents, and Mediterranean section. Large parts closed off for corporate events."
"The Flower Dome is one of four parts of the Gardens by the bay complex. It was my least favorite - not bad, but not exceptional. If I had to choose between this dome and the National Orchid Garden at the Singapore Botanical Gardens, the Orchids win out. But when combined with the other three parts of the Gardens by the bay, namely the Cloud Forest dome and the Supertree light and sound show, I would be happy with the Gardens by the Bay. If you have limited time at the Gardens by the Bay, go to the Cloud Forest dome first. The 15 minute long light and sound show at 7:45 and 8:45 (check website for times) would be my second pick, followed by the Flower dome. Hope this review and opinion helps!"
I think everyone should try the skywalk in the garden by the way but the flower doom was not very exciting. The cactuses are nice but the flowers are not so exciting. Maybe this is because I'm living in New Zealand and I can see beautiful flowers and plants everyday there.
Going by the name I was expecting a riot of colour instead it had been disneyfied for Xmas and seemed to be more about that. Next time I'd just go for the cloud forest
The dome is huge and good. The space is Aircon. You will appreciate if you like green. Lot of plant from different countries.
Sg$28 for a combo ticket with cloud first dome. Nice and cool inside. Nice area to walk around and explore. Signs with plant names and descriptions but nothing about the ages of the plants or how they got there. Would of been interesting to know especially the olive trees.
Unfortunately we happened to visit whilst the current display was being changed over and some of flowers were starting to die. Overall it was ok & a nice way to escape the heat but I found it underwhelming compared to the National Orchid Garden in the Botanic Gardens. It was nice to see the succulents and different varieties of plants/flowers but personally I would skip this and just visit the Cloud forest! The Cloud forest was amazing & also has a whole section of different orchids on display!
"It is just OK to me, since I saw many green houses like that already. Anyway, it just need more maintenance and protection from the tourists, just overflown with guests."
"For someone who had the privilege to live in cities with lovely botanical gardens - indoors or outdoors, it's hard to appreciate why the plants in the Flower Dome are in an airconditioned space in a tropical city. Yes, the blooms are lovely. Yes, perhaps, this is a real attraction for a certain group of tourists. Most of the flora are from temperate areas except for the desert plants and cacti, I guess. Most people I see visiting this place are from temperate countries. I don't necessarily think they will be gushing over the blooms in this place.The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are pretty symbolic in reminding people that Singapore is a bubble. Great for a visit, has all the first world comforts, but probably ambivalent to reality in other parts of Southeast Asia. So, if you are traveling in the region, please don't just stop in Singapore - which is a real amazing international hub. Step outside and see what Southeast Asia really is by picking another city on the map."
"The dome is spectacular, but the presentation of the plants is not.Does not worth the ticket price. An interesting variey of plants and flowers, but not spectacular"
There is an entry ticket for flower dome. You might get it cheaper if you take from local vendor at China Town. The flower dome has a theme flower according to the season. October was sunflower. It was pretty. They have made up a castle in the centre and stuff like that. But if you are in a time crunch. It's skippable. It's not as if you have never seen anything like this before.
"Yeah there were a whole heap of sunflowers, but other than that I saw more flowers on the walk to Satay by the Bay and in my dad's garden at home. Not the showstopper I expected it to be."
"I really should have considered by Hayfever allergy before buying a ticket and entering the flower dome.On entry my eyes were beginning to sting, must be alot of pollen knocking about it there.Wasn't easy to get out the place either once you were in which only added to my suffering. I think i probably did the quickest loop of the flower dome in history before finding sanctuary back outside. After 20 mins and some water to sooth the pain i was ok again. I'm sure its a great place, just not suitable for me."
Im not into gardens so didn't hold my attention Ive seen better displays and exhibits. If you don't get there no biggie. So many tourists hard to take photos as always a stranger in your photos. However close ups on flowers are good.
"Flower Dome is kind of pricey to visit, so unless you're really into flowers and gardening, I recommend to just see the admission free Supertree Grove (outside) instead.Reach Gardens by the Bay by alighting at the Bayfront MRT station and following the signs that bring you outside the hotel, to an elevator and then to a footbridge."
It was good to see but honestly this dome wasn't my favourite and felt a little tacky and very fake in a way
though the whole scene a bit taki better suited for young kids I appreciate the work that goes into it just thought it was a bit over the top the exhibition opposite is much better laid out if you have young kids worth the visit the rest of the park is amazing though very well planned you can do all the park not pay a cent but the enclosed area take the whole day its huge
"A nice variety of flowers; very easy to walk around; lots of hidden statues to try to find, including a Christopher Robin and several owls."
We weren't taken by our visit. If you're an avid plant lover or gardener then it's probably great; but we weren't very impressed and only spent about 15-20 minutes in the place.The Cloud Forest in our opinion was far better.
"If you are tree lover , then you will find variety of trees here. Just plan if you have time. May be 1-2 hours enough to roam around."
"If you are in the Garden by the Bay and have nothing to do till the light show, you may visit this dome too. The architecture is mesmerizing but as a programme, I can only offer this to flower maniacs. Rest of us can enjoy a short walk there."
Some atttractive floral species but with whole bunch of vinyl cutesy critters tossed in randomly. Finding an exit is an incredible challenge. Save your money for the Cloud Forest.
"Situted in the Gardens By The Bay we bought a joint ticket with the Cloud attraction which is far superior.There are several sections devoted to different world regions, but nothing special.A very bright flower section celebrated Chinese New Year, but looked a bit tacky.My favourite section was the Baobab section on the upper floor"
"Although very busy with tourists, I felt this attraction seemed false, rather than authentic and was overpriced. It doesn't take very long to walk around it and I much preferred the botanic gardens as a spectacle."
"so if I get it right this supposed to be a botanic garden displaying plants from mostly warm/humid climates. but guess what: it is arctic cold inside with artificial snow and poinsettias, and a north pole display.poor plants are struggling to survive I am sure, but so are the people - the staff were wearing winter jackets (that's how cold it was inside).and for the love of everything that is sacred - I come from a cold climate to a warm getaway to be warm. why, oh why should I want to be in a fridge? I could just be home in my usual winter setting (and be wearing my winter apparel as opposed to my tropical dress in 15 Celsius)save yourself the time and money, skip this one"
"The flower dome shows plants and vegetation from various parts of the world.Ok if you buy as combination ticket with the cloud forest but not recommended stand alone.From a European perspective everything felt too artificial and over crowded. Christmas decoration not very nice and a bit 'trashy'.A lot of blocked walkways and inaccessible stairs make it annoying to find your way around, esp. towards the cactus area at the top."
"Nice plants, but too little. Too poor fantasy of designers.You should make more bridges, places for sitting and walking on different levels, more funny objects like minerals, caves, multilevel ponds etc.20 years ago it was ok. Now... it's not. This time it's just boring place.Hire me and I would make a real pearl from that spot"
"This exhibit presents the flowers of the world. I was expecting plants and flowers from Singapore or from southeast Asia only. I was disappointed to see cactus, roses and plants growing in my own backyard in Canada, this is not why I came to Singapore... Layout is just ok. Nice sculptures and decorations, but if you only have time for one dome, prefer the Cloud Forest."
"Bland, boring, processed contrivance masquerading as garden. Even given the constraints of creating authentic jungle with cultivated garden, there becomes an awareness of flowers tortured into subservient line ups, looking oddly manufactured. One realises too soon that the entire concept fails abysmally. No where is there energy, no marvellous random sweep of nature, carelessly sidestepping one's path. The main event the majestic mountain should at least contain some real wild life?. If not some spectacular birds of prey, then a bit of nostalgic cinematic reference for kids and older kids, Give us a King Kong at least to have something to savour/ glimpse for a good debrief on the way home. Something to enthuse about? after all that well behaved walkabout..."
"Disappointed by how the done was ruined with Xmas trees, Xmas decorations and Disney toys all over the place. This is a place to look at flowers, not plastics toys."
"Unfortunately visited cloud forest first so this was quite disappointing, the wizard of oz theme was quite amusing, and there were some purple sunflowers otherwise not fantastic"
Felt this was a waste of time except to enjoy the cool aircon. The whole thing felt tacky and artificial. Only bother if you have time to kill
"I was less than impressed by the Flower Dome. It fails in comparison to the Singapore Botanical Garden, including a tour to the National Orchid Garden, which are real gems. The only good thing I have to say is that the climate in the dome is real nice."
"...we 've been there for a local sakura event , with stops to take photos and queuing it took us 15mn to finish. The park is far being from outstanding, no much to see but a lot of people and bit pricy."
"We caught the seasonal exhibit of tulips, but it was rather disappointing in scope and scale. I realize that I shouldn't compare it to Keukenhof but the Flower Dome's effort seemed less than inspired."
This is an impressive garden dome with about 500% too many visitors.What should be a relaxing stroll through the gorgeous gardens is in fact a fight to pass the throngs of crowds and millions of people taking photos.
"Bit disappointing, we felt. Nice and cool, a relief from the humidity outside! Interesting if you are into flowers maybe"
"I find it kitschy, but my fiancee loves it. I think it is the question of taste. The only flowers I love to observe is the'tiny' Orchids"
"It was my 4th time to visit and quite dissapointed with the flowers. It was not as fresh as usual, was informed that 2 days after they will close the garden due to maintenance."
"Ok experience, i think not really worth it to pay money for it, when I visit the Christmas decorations still there where make people feel the atmospheres, I cannot imagine without the festive decoration the place will become very dull n boring."
"my wife and i are avid travellers. we are also expats who have spent the last decade living in the middle east, so we really appreciate things like rain, and flowers. maybe it was the time of year we visited (december) but i was unimpressed. it was 2 levels of cactus and one level of a ""christmas"" theme. if you can, check ahead to see what the arrangements are before you buy tickets."
"I was so disappointed. Not many flowers, it is more a plant dome. The area with sukkulent is great, but the rest not really worth it. The flower Field was replaced by Christmas exhibition. Go to Forest Dome instead. Entrance to both cost 28 SGD for one adult. Opens at 9am and closes at 9 pm. Tickets at park entrance or at the domes. The domes are 10 minutes walk from the park entrance. Or you can pay 3 SDG to take a shuttle There."
"After the worth-the-money Cloud Dome, we went to the Flower Dome and were disappointed. Okay, there are some nice flowers there. But since Christmas season already started, and with decoration and music, it felt more like in a shopping mall (or the space between shopping malls) than an actual first-class tourist attraction. Hence, would not spend money to go there."
"As tourist, we had no cholce but to buy the combined flower dome and cloud forest ticket for $28. Locals have the option of buying either for only $10 each but as tourists, it was both or nothing. Well, Cloud Forest was worth its half but Flower Dome was a huge disappointment. We spent maybe 30-45 minutes, and that was the fastest we could walk through the place. We visited early October so we were treated to exhibits after exhibits of pumpkins. There were exhibits of flowers from various continents but they were boring. On the scale of 1 to 10, if Bouchart Gardens in Victoria is a 10, flower dome is a 2. Wished we could have bought only the Cloud Forest ticket, but then, they probably would get very few people to visit Flower Dome."
We visited here after the botanical gardens and they weren't a patch on them. It's called the flower dome but there were more trees than anything. Very cold in there which is nice at first coming in from the heat but then take a jumper.Considering you have to pay to get in (28 sgd for both conservatories) when the botanical gardens is free and 5 sgd for the orchid part it's just not worth it.The cloud forest is good but don't pay to come in here it's rubbish
"In all fairness: I was expecting something much more natural and I have found some kind of ""Disney Land"" with plastic figures and main stream stuff I don't like at all. Being the day before in the Singapore Botanic Garden and the National Orchid Garden I would recommend any tourist who is after ""pure nature"" to avoid Flower Dome"". Especially for families with kids all the plastic figures might be exactly the right thing."
"The garden is a lot smaller than the cloud dome and as we went to the cloud dome first, this dome was a disappointment. There were more flowers in the cloud dome than in the flower dome. The flower dome just doesn't wow like the cloud dome. I say this especially for those who are a bit tight on time or budget and have to choose one over the other."
"Seriously, in this place you have a feeling that all plants and flowers are locked up against their will. The lines are just to perfect, that you don't see nature. It looks plastic even though it's not."
Appreciating the efforts but coming from a place full of greenery the experience was disappointing.Better to visit botanical and orchid gardens unless you have nothing else to do or need air-conditioned garden experience.
"Just like the Cloud Forest, possibly even more this was a disappointment. I love gardens don't get me wrong. This was a series of boring repetitive landscaping elements with many different flowers but with out any magic or charm. All too manicured, to pristine, without any imagination without anything braking the cookie cutter style of presentation. Poor plants, they were totally denatured in this absolutely artificial environment."
"It was a very nice area but I was hoping for a colourful experience instead there was a lot of greenery, after going to the National Orchid garden this was a massive let down. It is a lot cooler looking place but is really all style over substance."
"For the cost of the experience, its disappointing. They charge seperately for the audio tour. this should be included in the ticket price .I have seen better displays of flowers for free. Its just a glorified green house that you will see in any country. If it were not for the cloud forest, i would have called it a rip off!"
It was alright. Doesn't worth Singapore $16 which is entry fee. Take shuttle to reach this place coz lots of walking.
The cloud forest was much better. This wasnt impressive at all. Kind of boring actually. Tried to leave after a few minures but you have to walk through all of it to leave
"The Flower Dome is huge and has some quite interesting plants. However, I can only give at most 2 stars for the following reasons:- The ticket price of 28 SGD for both the conservatories is pretty overpriced for what you get. Especially, compared to the bay south gardens outside which are free accessible.- It was freaking cold in there, you cannot stay any longer than like half an hour. Definitely bring a jacket, if you plan to stay any longer.- It is called ""Flower Dome"", however, the ratio of actual flowers compared to other green plants. Expecting masses of flowers, the whole ""Flower Dome"" looked pretty colorless. Most of the few colorful flowers were pretty ""usual"" flowers that anyone could purchase for home decoration, nothing too particular."
"Anywhere in the world this would not be possible - how can flowers from all over the world exist under one dome, in controlled temperatures environment? When you walk down the paths of the Flower Dome, you really feel strange. But then again, it's done well and it is exciting to see all that variety of coexistence.."
"This was essentially a waste of money on a small botanical garden under a nice roof! tickets for this attraction are sold as combo with the cloud forest(28$) for non-locals, otherwise would have advised against visiting the flower dome..."
Go the botanic gardens instead. They are much more worth your time. Obviously designed to cater to the cruise boat passengers with limited time.
I visited SIngapore before this attraction has been built. I waited some years forgood conditions to go here (sunny weather). I did it during this february I have seenmany botanical garden over the world. This has nothing to do with it - its just commercefor tourist. Furthermore the hall is supercool (max 20 degrees) and overcrowded.
"The Flower Dome fades in comparison with the Cloud Forest Dome. I strongly suggest taking the Flower Dome first before entering the Cloud Forest Dome. It does show an impressive array of flowers, cactuses, palms and so on. If you ask me, you might as well save some money by choosing the Cloud Forest Dome only."
Not really worth the time or the money. Display and variety is not impressive. Makes a nice escape from the heat though.... but will not recommend it.
"I've been to a flower market and the wide choice together with the buzz of buying and selling is infinitely more dynamic and engrossing than here. Yes, a nice enough selection of plants, but many were plants that you can easily see wild in Asia or Europe. I was looking forward to a degustation of fauna, instead, a rather tame display of plants and flowers."
"This is meant to be one of the ""must sees"" in Singapore, personally feel that it wasn't really worth the entrance fee. Nicely crafted gardens inside showing plants and flowers from around the world, but basically no better than the free admission gardens which are outside"
"Only good if you are looking to kill time (nice way of saying it was utterly boring). If you purchase tickets online, make sure you save it as PDF and not a screenshot since gate keeper will not let you in (at least on the particular day we went). Since there is no wifi for you to access your email and McDonald's requires you to enter your phone number to use their wifi (which is a problem if you are not from Singapore) you will have to forcefully convince the ticket booth to honor your online ticket purchase; they will stamp your hand if successful."
"Needed more flowers. I could see what the theme was supposed to be; however, to be a flower dome you need more flowers. The best exhibit was the Christmas displace. After Christmas, I would be curious as to how it is advertised."
Whilst nice and well laid out and its air conditioned it is just a botanical garden.For free you can visit the Outdoor botanical gardens in the heart of Singapore. These are great and the orchids magnificent.
A huge effort has been done to present so many orchids here and they are all gorgeous but after the cloud garden I found it a bit sterile.
"This was pretty underwhelming to be honest - after experiencing some amazing attractions in Singapore (including the fantastic botanical gardens), overall this felt a bit of a let-down even though they have obviously tried very hard to make it a success."
"If you've spent $100s or even $1000s to visit Singapore, you are charged an extra 40% to visit the flower domes at Gardens by the Bay - $28 compared with $20 for locals. With that insult, you are treated to a very ordinary display of plants and flowers. Having seen 100s of plant and floral displays around the world, many of them free, this would have to be one of the least inspiring. This in spite of the inclusion of ""Tulipmania"" which features a display of tulips in April and May.Most of the plants are common Australian garden plants and better displays are seen at garden shows such as the Melbourne Flower and Garden Show. You see even less if visiting after sunset as inadequate lighting prevents you from seeing all the detail.The Cloud Forest dome adds little to the experience.I'd recommend a visit to the Gardens by the Bay in the late afternoon, staying long enough to view the 7.45pm light show."
"I will be back at gardens by the bay, but I won't visit flower dome next time.. The flowers were a bit boring, rather common flowers, nothing I hadn't seen before just being a normal person with no extensive flower knowledge.. Go to Cloud Forest, it's much more of an experience and a beautiful set up, seeming natural!If you are in shortage of time if money, safe it and visit just Cloud Forest and sky walk."
"We were so excited to visit here after the amazing experience at Cloud Forest. But the first thing we are told is ""KEEP MOVING""!! With the attendants of the flower dome twirling around bright orange batons and acting like we were cattle. It was quite upsetting and really made the whole visit there unenjoyable. If they were expecting large crowds for this cherry blossom event (which I had read nothing about as I was planning my trip to Singapore for weeks now) they should have LIMITED ADMISSIONS per day OR add the cherry blossom on as an extra exhibit for an added fee. The crowd control/patrol was intimidating and took away from the beauty of this excursion. We paid $ to get in and enjoy this ""spectacular building exhibit"". So upsetting and a shame to have to write a review like this. :/"
Not happy this dome was closed for renovations. See other posts for Gardens by the Bay. Again a reminder to check the whole lot are open as you pay full price even though partrs are closed.
"Don't waste your money. The only interesting thing is the dome, which you can see from outside. Inside it's a bland, contrived, uninspiring mishmash. They've even got flowers made of Lego! What a wasted opportunity to create something special. It's feels like a shopping mall."
"I heard about this place but I had not realised the great atmosphere until I visited this attraction.As you step in from the warm and humid outside, you can feel the beauty of the flower dome hit you.The arrangement of the flower beds, the colourful display of flowers, the shrubs and plants hold you in awe.The variety of colours and the variety of flowers from different parts of the world make you realise how artistic is Mother Nature to produce this wonderful spectacle.The Japanese flower arrangements were all most spectacular.This is a must visit place."
What seems to be remnants of the Chinese New Year exhibit were in the form of wilted flowers. The flow of the paths do not make sense. The only nice thing about this place is the Aircon.
The flower dome was certainly a disappointment we were expecting to see flowers and flowers and flowers but they made it into at Christmas attraction with a lot of Christmas decorations. Not worth the money at all. The cloud forest was fantastic and I would choose to only do that one if I would have known.
"If you're in Singapore'a country with the most beautiful botanical gardens and where lush beauty is everywhere'why spend time and money on a tacky, amusement style theme park 'garden'? The antithesis of natural gardens: fake snow, a cheap gift shop at every turn, and even a McDonalds. But if you do go, wear a parka'it's very cold."
"Yes it might be pretty if it was a backyard. But it should be better than that. The flower dome is very boring. It has a bunch of sections, and each one has some plants from all over the world. Meh. Go to cloud forest instead"
"Unlike the magnificent cloud forest, the flower dome is nothing special.I could not get the sense of a Disney's Christmas tree in the middle of the pavilion."
Flower Dome means BOREDOMe! trust me.. this is the most boring part of our trip. I suggest that you should pay for the Cloud Forest/Dome instead of going here. We enjoyed the cloud forest simply because it is airconditioned. Realtalk. Thats it.
"Really overrated and overpriced place. Boring, nothing fancy or colorful to see here. Many of the flowers were dead. I would not recommend this place to anyone"
"When you say flower dome..You go there expecting to see some flowers, we only saw cactus. Maybe it was an off season when I went, giving them a benefit of doubt. But a very disappointing experience. Would recommend you skip it if you are short of time.!"
"What a Rip-Off , only for the truly Horticulturist types, we were disappointed in the so called attraction"
"You should go to the botanic gardens for almost everything you can see here for free, the rest isn't as well kept, and can skip it.."
"Just visited Flower Done, truly exceptional indoor gardens. Temperature surprisingly cool, but not chilly. Understand it can be crowded at weekends, went Thursday afternoon, not crowded. The scent of the place, the fliers, the sculptures, unsurpassable. Truly memorable experience."
"In light of the big deal that is made of this attraction, and given the size of the dome, I expected a fantastic exhibit. It was very unimpressive and I walked through very quickly."
It is a very well built landscape of plants . However honestly speaking was not too impressed by it . there should be more saring of knowledge about these othersie its just see and keep moving
This place.is not worth the money. Also why will I want to see plants in a AC environment. It's a garden in a garden . I wonder how the plants survive the cold given that there are some plants from the hotter region.
"Poor sighting, short tour, no guidelines, overpriced. Not interesting. Please go to a nature reserve and enjoy real nature."
"Went there with my mom for the Sakura (cherry blossoms) festival in March. We were sorely disappointed. The flowers looked uninspiring and like they were nearing their wilting stage. Not to mention, it was unbelievably crowded on a weekend and what was supposed to be a nice treat for my mom became a jostle with the huge selfie-taking crowds and long snaking queues. If you want to view flowers, best to view them in their native land where they grew from the soil, in their suitable climate. Uprooting plants from their native land and displaying them somewhere else is always a bad idea. I've learnt my lesson. :("
"I don't see the point of this attraction. I walked around and got more and more confused. Was this supposed to be educational? Entertaining? I have no idea. I left without an appreciation of why anything was there. Probably the only saving grace is that the place was cool, and a nice respite from the humid, tropical heat. Other than that, don't waste your money."
"Awesome displays in both flower dome and coud forest.Safe distancing ambassors are attentive at all times, kudos to the management for keeping the place safe for all of us."
"GBTB is the closest you'll get to immersing yourself and being one with nature, while being in your OOTD, with absolute style and comfort."
"Very nice place to relax and enjoy. Beautiful light deco at night. Got light show at night. No enrty ticket needed to go for garden and park. To go cloud forest and flower dome, sky walk need to buy entry tickets."
Great to walk around at night. Wait for the time where the music is being played so that you can enjoy the lights n sound at its full glory. Calming experience and a good workout as well.
Need to book attractions from website. Can't get tickets from the booth anymore now due to covid-19. Food courts available in there as well as satay by the bay. Both domes are a must to see
"If you like fauna snd floral, you have to come here. I usually spend up to 3 hours - 1 hour at Flower Dome (seasonal deco), 1 hour at Cloud Forrest and 1 hour roaming the outdoor. There is an ocbc skypark and Floral Fantasy, see these 2 once is enough. These 4 attractions are paid entry. The park is very well maintained, i never tired of roaming the open park. Located near Bayfront MRT, walking distance to Satay Club and Marina Barriage. Sometimes I walk to these places too. Have fun!"
Went there in Dec as some of my friends wanted to visit. Belive me....the domes did not disappoint! Just go if you have the time..
"Such a fantastic place to visit if you like gardening, flowers and scenery, this is the most relaxing garden I have ever visited. Everywhere you looked was pristine with healthy tropical plants and orchids.When you enter you are faced with a huge waterfall, so powerful.We all loved it and my daughter was able to take lots of photos for IG."
"Amazing place, full of things to learn, see and explore. Perfect for families, couples or single visitors. Just bear in mind it's huge and you need at least a full day to see everything but that better yet if you split your visit into 2 days. Don't forget to stay for the lights and sounds display after sunset."
"If you're looking for a place to unwind and find peace, do take a walk and enjoy Gardens by the Bay. The artificial waterfall is so relaxing to watch. You can take a trip up and be amazed."
"Got to the park in the early hours. Plan was to take some sunrise and morning Golden hour shots of the park, Sand Bay and the awakening downtown behind. Besides the fact that I managed to tuk my 'dragon' into a palm tree the videos are off the hook!As for the gardens, whow! Certainly I did not dedicate the required amount of time for what it has to offer - being 6-7 AM everything was just closed and pitch empty but the nature is just off the hook! A little jungle getaway within a walk from the bustle.I cannot give any hints or recommendation on the services and facilities (which I am confident are stunning) but if you are in need for a moment with nature it is the place to be!"
"The flower is nice, cooling temperature. Very comfortable place for dating or bringing kids! there are benches around so no need to worry abt it"
"As we headed over towards the Gardens we saw the Supertrees emerging in the distance, it seemed like we were entering another world. Some of the Supertrees are around 160ft in height and are incredibly impressive structures. We spent the day exploring the conservatories, we loved everything we saw"
"It is 3-4 incredible gardens wrapped into one. A simply amazing attraction that you MUST SEE if you are in Singapore. There is nothing like this in the world. Yes there are all times of botanical gardens in glass greenhouses. However, there is nothing like a 7 story verdant, green mountain with a waterfall enclosed in glass. Then there is an incredible greenhouse of flowers and palms with all kinds of seasonal designs. Then there are the fantastic SuperTrees that tower above the garden and light up for an amazing display at night. This does not even include the simply incredible gardens with awesome views of the Sands and other Singapore sights. I can not say enough good things about this. It is simply something you have to see in Singapore."
"This must be one of the most amazing public gardens that i've been too. Outstanding design, and spots for photos!!"
We went to see the christmas decoration in the floral dom.For those who has not visited the Dom. It is air conditioned and it is not tiring to walk the floral dom as it is not v big too. Very nice flowers and the maintenance cost should be v expensive but the ticket is still quite affordable.Recommended to visit.
"Being among greenery in the indoor botanical garden never failed to refreshes me. There is always some thematic flora and fauna for almost every special occasion all round the year (Chinese New Year, Christmas or Sakura Festival)."
Beautiful place to relax and chill and talk and paint. Perfect place to watch so many dogs and photoshoots and click pictures with masks
"Nice xmas theme and beatuiful Flowers and planets as it was so good to educate my self and my child using AI app to identify the different plants, cactus and flowers most of the description is already in place on information panel"
"Truly amazing wonders of Singapore. How can they invent a mechanism to grow different variants of flowers, plants and diff species growing all together like a family."
I went to garden by the bay light show 2020 with my gf on christmas which i felt the decoration is very attractive and suitable for whose likes to take photo. The entrance fee is cheap around ~6sgd. Worth a Visit.
"Christmas decor will be up until 3 jan 2021, fully recommend to go before its taken down! Going in the morning is better to avoid the crowds"
"one of my favourite places in Singapore, and really pretty too. Great place for picnics, dates, or just walking around, since the garden is really big. The garden is very clean, and staff are helpful and friendly. Its great to see how the staff enforce COVID19 measures too, and they take it very seriously. Tickets are worth the price, and overall the experience is really great! a must visit! however, do take note that its really crowded on weekends (like VERY) so try to go on weekdays instead to avoid the crowd :)"
"I visit this place frequently with my mother for walks and afternoon tea. She's not quite a gardener or a plant person but definitely enjoy the cool environment to take her walks and stretch her legs. As for me, im a major plant lover so this place is heaven.will be visiting again soon"
"A walk to Gardens by the bay, great atmosphere like super natural living in this singapore.... kind of mentally relax during this visit ...."
One of the places in Singapore in which I will always bring my international visitors to experience Singapore as a Garden City. A walk through the two domes and to finish off with the music and light show. This night show is magical and always awesome to my visitors. And the best thing is that it is free to watch and enjoy!
Beautiful gardens illuminated by dazzling lights. Good food options including hawker centre serving good satay and a McDonald's
"This is my 4th time visiting this Garden during the past 6 months. The Flower Dome is always filled with different flowers and decorations based on the theme of the month. Every time I visit this place, I will see or read about something new which i didn't notice early. The flowers are kept and trees are pruned regularly.The Cloud forest is also an amazing place with waterfall which welcomes you at the entrance and the variety of plants never fail to amaze me each time I go there. It is a therapeutic place to take in the fresh air."
"We booked our tickets online at S$18 each, and spent 2 hours each at the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. We're Singaporeans, we live here ....... but this was our very 1st visit. It will definitely not be our last. It's a completely different experience as compared with Botanical Gardens which is no doubt free entrance and open to the public ..... unlike our visit to the conservatories. But we feel it was more than money well spent cos the whole experience was not only extremely pleasant and wonderful ..... but we also felt very proud that so much thought and attention to detail that went into making this a must visit location.At the end of our journey to Gardens By The Bay, we wanted to become Friends of this Garden, and highly recommend that all Singaporeans ( and of course all overseas visitors ) make the time to visit the conservatories and walk around the Garden that is open to the public for free."
Thoroughly enjoy the walk at Gardens by the Bay. Thankful to be exploring my own country because of the a COVID Travel restriction. Playing tourist in my own country more fun than I could ever imagine. Gardens by the Bay is such a beautifully designed garden at such a massive scale. Make me proud to be a Singaporean.
"Artificially made to excellence, gardens by the bay is a paradise for nature lovers in the concrete jungle of Singapore main city area. We spent most of our time at Singapore at this place with a lot of things in offer."
Perfect to spend a nice afternoon. Huge place and full of greeneries and nice corners to see gardens such as the cactus garden and some scriptures.
"A place to relax and admire the planting. A walk round the gardens is interesting with unexpected sculptures and water features. Sometimes encountering native animals outside the indoor gardens. Changing plantings in some areas, as well as the specific gardens of many countries on display, keeps it interesting."
"The walkway is great, excellent view and great at night.This is a great area to explore and it's a free attraction except the high walkway."
"Not to be missed. Another spot that you can spend an entire day at. The gardens, both inside and outside are wonderful. The food court on site was excellent. The evening light show is a wonder to behold."
Beautiful place that I can only dream of going back to when I hopefully return to Singapore . Loved it .
"Pleasant stroll with daughter. There were barely any people, which made it quite a nice, relaxing outing. We had only intended to walk by the waterside, but ended up visiting the tree area and continued towards Marina Barrage."
"Great view and spectacular garden. Worth your time to visit, especially when it is your first time in Singapore."
BEAUTIFUL garden! love to go there to run and breath some fresh air. good spot to run after work. there's some hawker center too in case you are HUNGRY
"Nice place to spend evenings with family. There are also various dining choices over there. Went there several times with family and friends. Whoever comes to visit my house, we always take them there to enjoy a quality time."
Gardens by Bay is soooo beautiful at night. Sooo many colours. It's like a magical place..It's very near to Marina Bay
"Especially love the Flower Dome where they have the mini cactus, different gardens of the world etc. A nice therapeutic way to spend a day :)Managed to catch the mid autumn light up."
Come on weekday for uninterrupted view. We really love the day view as compared to night view of GBTB.
this is a must do when in Singapore. Great in the evening as the trees light up etc just incredible go asap
It was just amazingly huge and amazingly good . The flower dome blew my mind with its range of plant life from all over the world. And then the cloud dine with its feature waterfall and skywsll was mesmerising- espas the sun went down
"I had gone to this beautiful and wonderful Garden along with my family and friends, it is worth visiting while you are in Singapura. The more you wonder in this garden, you still pause that no corner escapes your eyes. You end up there the whole day, still you long for more."
"Truly a garden city. Good for morning walks, if you have a chance, head into the domes (Have to pay). They have themed decorations so it will be good to check it out before heading in.Food option nearby is a bit limited but you could walk a bit more to get to a food center nearby!"
There are so many amazing displays of flowers that its hard to pick a favorite. But the Orchid section was awesome.
"With all the travel restrictions due to COVID, this place is worth a visit. Honestly I didn't think much of it pre-COVID as I thought it was a tourist area. But it is a fun area to explore. Singapore is known as a garden city, this shows a different kind of garden where its cooling and there is a different vibe to it.Additionally you get to support the tourism industry that is affected by COVID."
"Big spacious garden, beautiful scenery n peaceful. There are many attractions (need to pay for entrance) within the garden.At night it turn into interesting beautiful musical colourful garden which is free.During special events like mid summer festival, it turns into lantern park with theme from all over the world and it is free for all."
We visited Gardens by the Bay in March and were not disappointed its such a wonderful place the gardens and plants are stunning
"If you are into the natures, flowers or colors, let's visit this place.I am not into photography so much, but it is a great place for those who loved colorful backgrounds."
"Pretty domes and great ambience. Can get a little cooling as both are air conditoned. Do bring along a jacket or cardigan. My folks were freezing especially with the rainy weather this season. Overall, good to take a stroll in"
You should definitely visit Gardens by the Bay while you are there! The garden and the lights and the trees are amazing!
The Gardens by the Bay are an oasis of wildlife free to roam. There is an abundance to see and despite going a few times a week I still see different birds and wildlife.Outlets for food and refreshments from high end to basic (satay by the bay).The two domes are worth a visit and listed separately on Trip-advisor.There are beautiful lakes to walk around - under the OCBC Trees that lead you to the meadow. Sculptures abound. They even have free WiFi indoors and out.If you plan to visit the domes you need reservations during this Covid period.This is a wonderful place to visit!!!
i love this place during the day and even more during the night with all the lights ON.I prefer to come for the light show around 20.00 or at night around 00.00 am since it wont be crowded.It has some attraction to visit as well. The easiest way to reach by the bayfront mrt or taxi.Its free entrance so dont worry about that!Enjoy your day!
"Easy to find, any taxi driver will be able to drop you to the Gardens. There are several different areas and all are beautiful. Even my teenagers were blown away by the place and they thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon."
Beautiful park with some high viewpoints from where you can look out all over the park and parts of the city. This park is a must if you are visiting Singapore.If you have children with you a good idea is to bring some swimwear for them to be able to take a cool off at the fountain area at the children's special park . In the area there are changing rooms for changing into swimwear.
"Highly acclaimed and voted by many influential medias and travel portals as one of the best gardens in the world, Gardens by the Bay truly live up to its name. Over the years, it is a must visit for any Singapore traveller, and a venue for numerous events on the yearly calender. Spend a whole day here, even just the selfie or serious photography spots are already dizzying. And if you're a floral, fauna person, the flowers, plants, bugs and birds will keep you super busy. The gardens are segmented into various themed divisions and self tour guide tours are visibly located. Toilets and amenities are plentiful, even if you're hungry, eats and hawkers nearby at Satay by the Bay. Highlights here of course are the Sky trees, the flower dome and the cloud forest. I am not going to spoil the surprise but if you're touring Singapore, spare at least half a day here, at least. And if you're a resident in Singapore, it pays to be a Friend of the Garden yearly patron. Beside the occasional themed events, you can enjoy frequent dome and forest visits, you can also come exercise at the track just by the bay, chill at the sky trees, or enjoy a walk around the park. Curated nature at its best."
"Enjoy the beauty of garden , u will love to be there. U will be amazed to see night lighting and music show"
"This is a garden of havenmust nee to visit, awesome place best looking sencemust need to visit again"
I went there with my girlfriend to have some good time for the Chinese New Year. It was a wonderful experience. looking forward for the next year visit.
Gardens by the Bay is not to be missed when visiting Singapore. Everything in that park is magnificent. My favorite part is the evening lights show.
"My daughter and I visited both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest in the early evening. It was wonderful to see the places all lighted up as the sun set, giving us an almost surreal experience (especially in the Cloud Forest)."
"I saw a National Day promotion in the website to enter this 2 places with just S$20/adult and it offered unlimited visits for 6 months. Also, is air-conditioned so by going with a mask in afternoon will not be hot. We spent about 1.5 hours in Flower Dome as there are more things to see. And there's a cafe inside that served high tea set. In Cloud Forest, not too many things to see but worth a walk on the bridges. The view of the water fall as you entered is nice though. But we only spend an hour here. We started at around 3pm and have our dinner at 6pm, and ended with a nice stroll at the garden to the mrt.You will need to book the time in the website before you go. They will give a time range of one hour, and you may enter within the time frame. Worth visiting."
"This was the best part of visiting Singapore! Gardens are apsolutely stunning and amazing! We decided to go before sunset and enjoy, and after stayed for night light show. Maybe it was over crowded during the night, but worth it!"
Beautiful fawn and flowers. Kids running around. So much fun for the whole family. Suitable for young children and can bring pets along but must be on leash.
"Visited late afternoon and the gardens were practically empty which made for a very peaceful stroll around. I pre-purchased a ticket for the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest - both were busy but not so crowded which made it much easier to see things. Not sure I would want to go there under normal circumstances but for once, COVID19 has an upside !! Loved the Cloud Forest in particular although take a coverup - I didn't and was actually quite cold by the time I exited. Will visit again as would be lovely to see the place at a different time of the year."
"You won't regret it, lovely greens and flowers, at least visit once but don't mind to do the second time"
"I was lucky to visit Gardens By the Bay twice and both visits were amazing. They change their themes every now and then. The place was clean, crews were respectful and friendly. Very systematic set up and very safe. Their offerings are very educational on environment. Bring your children and oldies here. They will enjoy and will love it."
I visited one morning recently and there were very few people around. It was peaceful and the very striking red jade vine was in full bloom. This vine can be seen near the elevator in the vicinity of the Super trees. There are other flowering plants to admire without entering the Flower Dome. A pleasant morning walk.
Enjoy the Flower Dome a lot especially with the membership which allows one to enjoy different types of flowers throughout the year.
"Excellent Gardens and exhibits, If you don't want to pay to access the exhibitions there is plenty to see and do that is free. Great walks and gardens, food outlets are ok. Satay by the Sea is a favorite for a cold drink and some good hawker food."
"With the Avatar-like super trees, and a big space to roam. This is possibly the most beautiful part of Singapore other than Sentosa. A must-visit for all tourists. While you are there, take a short walk to Marina barrage and you'll see families flying kites, and then detour back for a nice dinner at Satay by the Bay, and your experience will be almost complete! Take lotsa pictures!"
I`ve visited Singapore Gardens by the Bay in December. It was a fantastic Christmas decoration. I really recommend for feast spirit.
"Lovely flower and weather friendly. Highly recommend for every one in general, specially for people who love botany"
"One of the must do places to visit in Singapore. Even if you're not a keen gardener, you can't fail to be overwhelmed by the beauty of this attraction. Lovely break from the shops and restaurants. Accessible by local or hop on-hop off buses. Recommended"
We spent a day in the gardens wondering around. Visited the Cloud Dome and the Flower Dome and the tree walk. Amazing places!
I would recommend those who love to see greenery and spend a peaceful time after busy and stressful days.
"We loved the Gardens by the Bay, so much so that we visited a second time a few days later. Allow enough time to explore all that it has to offer. If you have young children make sure you pack some swimwear as there's a great water park. The best part is the light show at night, an experience you can not miss if you are visiting Singapore."
"The area is quite an espace and in the Singapore heat and humidity, you do need to be fairly fit to experience it all.The gardens are quite incredible and the architectural desings of the ""trees"" and canopy walks are just amazing. This is definitely a must see in Singapore.These are all free unless you wish to walk the canopy, at the tree top level or explore certain domes. The choice is yours. We did a mixture of the two.A great day and time well spent."
You would never see such amazing indoor gardens .So Colorful ..So Vibrant.Its like a dome and its all air conditioned. Huge acre of land for such divine park..You should visit during afternoon and evening because the flower dome all lights up in evening..
Visited the light show at Supertree Grove twice during my stay - I found it mesmerising! I also visited both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome - both immaculately maintained! Well worth a visit if you are in Singapore!
"Cloud forest and flower dome are very nicely built and maintained proper room temperature. This artificial forest looks like a mini paradise. The light and sound show at Garden by the Bay was truly picturesque, can't imagine how illumination technology is perfectly portrayed."
"My husband and I visited Gardens by the Bay as part of our honeymoon and hired a photographer from ShootMyTravel to take photos of us inside. It was so breathtakingly beautiful, our favourite was the Cloud Forest!It does get quite packed though, so we went in early (as soon as it opened!) to beat the crowds and get some good photos."
Wonderful experience in a unique environment. The skywalk is worth a visit as are the two main pavillions
The light show at night is highly recommended. It's really photogenic. Also this is a great place for run.
"We knew we wanted to go to gardens by the BAy and I am so glad we did, it is just incredible. We were a little rushed for time, so give yourself enough time to not have to rush. The supertrees are gorgeous but they turn them off at 10 so don't wait till too late to see them at night."
"We truly loved our somewhat brief visit to the Gardens by the Bay in early February 2020. Yes, it is crowded, but this is a must-visit while in Singapore. The grounds are incredible! We used a pre-purchased ticket that gave us access to both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. We absolutely loved the Cloud Forest, and an added bonus was that the cool temperature gave us a great way to cool off from the Singapore heat & humidity. While there, we considered buying a ticket for the Skywalk, but opted instead for Supertree Observatory. We visited Singapore during a very trying time with Coronavirus concerns, and we were happy to see that no stone was left unturned in terms of all the precautionary measures that were taken at the gardens to keep travelers safe. We even saw some patrons who were kept out of the domes due to having suspected fevers. The care and concern shown here was exemplary, and made our experience that much more amazing. We will gladly visit again on a return trip to Singapore!"
"The two domes themselves are an attraction. Laid out nicely are plants from all over the world, in different climates, leaning heavily on Asia. One dome is temperate and the other a cloud forest. on several stories. From the top of the cloud forest see an orchid garden (The one in the Botanical Gardens is much larger), Then walk down stairs and ramps to see huge plants."
"Everyone should visit this place! If you have never been here, you are missing out. In December they decorate all the gardens in Christmas decorations. Absolutely beautiful. A must see"
"Green thumbs rejoice (!), as yes it is true that, the Gardens by the Bay is gorgeous and just waiting for you, to check out while on tour in sensational Singapore. The sheer variety of healthy plants on display, make for a horticulturist's heaven, with gardens themed by both species and geography. The construction of these gardens also stands on its own as a major feat of modern day specialised engineering, as well as industrial artistry (the steel fabrication is just fabulous), too. In fact there is so much here that is amazing to see, that I personally feel that one should allow several hours to truly savour the visual delights. As 'variety (truly) is the spice of life' here, in reality, anyone who enjoys even the most occasional interest in botany, art, history and or engineering, should enjoy a visit to these amazing gardens. There is almost something for everyone to check out at Gardens by the Bay. It definitely is a bit of a 'must-do' for most tourists choosing to visit Singapore (see my Coffee Chill TV video on YouTube), in my humble opinion."
"The garden by the bay have the best flower and plant i have ever seen, it have indoor AC so dont need to worry about the hot weather in Singapore"
"The gardens by the bay is another good attractive places in Singapore and worldwide. I recommend every traveler to visit this place because many tourists love to visit this place and after you read my feedback you would love to come here. It is a wonderful garden and an Eco-friendly place. There tons of activities here. There are two main attractions named the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. There are many easy ways to visit this place. If you forgot to book tickets online, don't you worry. There are easy ways to take the tickets there itself! Both the attractions are lovely, beautiful, Eco-friendly, full of activities. The Flower Dome is full of flowers and is like the most beautiful gardens in the world. The Cloud Forest is also full of flowers and peaceful and there is also a very very very bis waterfall. You reach to the top of it on a bridge. It is also beautiful. The other things I won't tell you. You will have to go there and see by yourself."
Nice and exotic flowers and plants can be found there with good scenery for photo takings . Will not regret visiting this place .
"If you're into gardens and plants, allow the better part of a day to see all the grounds and then the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. The Super Trees are entertaining at night. Views of Singapore and the harbor are great from the Cloud Forest."
Time for some exercise again. Today took the route from the Singapore Barrage to Marina Bay Sands Hotel via Gardens by the Bay. All very sad and deserted. Following doctors orders and trying to keep up my 5km per day exercise.The Domes are closed but it is easy to walk around Gardens by the Bay. It's extremely well signposted and any GPS will guide you.Nice statues at the Barrage in metal by Lorenzo Quinn. On we go up past the police launch's and there I see a Malayan Water Monitor - just a juvenile about 60cms with tongue out - very photogenic. Up to the Gardens by the Bay and around various lakes. Star fruit and ginger abound. White throated and white collared kingfishers and even a steel sculpture of a kingfisher in the lake. Ducks and various wading birds with dragon flies and damsel flies. Pink snails eggs - just like I remember seeing in abundance at Lake Paoay. A woodpecker pecking away to a tune. Besides the pool I see a fully grown monitor lizard basking away. The Gardens always reminds me of good times with friends. The artificial trees are part of the sound and light event that no doubt will return after Covid. A couple of planes from the Singapore Air Force fly overhead. When the walk was finished I made my way to MBS - sad to see it 100% closed.Covid is just like a war - soon may it end!
"I visited here last summer and had a wonderful day. There is so much to see here, we paid to go into the domes and so glad we did. We spent hours in each one and could have spent even more time. We didn't have time to explore all of the free parts of the gardens so would love to come back one day and explore some more."
"Beautiful , well organised & an outstanding place - must visit. Centrally located ,equipped with fun place for kids . Flora collection is very interesting, specially the dome park, located in the center ."
"This fantastic area is located by the harbour front in Singapore and well worth a visit of at least 2-3 hours plus of you go later in the day, stay for the sound and light show where many of the sculptures are lit up with varying colours and patterns to the background of beautiful opera and music. There is an entry fee which varies on the number of sites you visit ' we did two ' the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. Both were amazing and truly beautiful in terms of size, colours, architecture, and gardens plus plants from all around the world, all under cover in these sites. There are huge waterfalls, spectacular indeed, and a fascinating display of orchids plus great areas of sculptures and statues dispersed amongst the gardens. It is all air conditioned and a very good place to escape the heat and humidity of Singapore. You can buy a ticket to use a mini train that takes you around the park but in fact we probably would have been better just to walk around ourselves. You can hire an audio guide but we were short of time and did not do this, we cannot comment on that aspect. Everything is however well laid out and signed and you can follow the guided paths very easily. There are good cafes around the site with excellent snack food and drinks."
"It's a world class man made forest, so amazing and the plants and mind blowing.Love to come back here one day!"
I came here with my older cousin and my younger cousin about 5 years old and of course their parents and my parents. It was amazing It was so beautiful and I would recommend it for everyone .It's good for all ages and the plants are amazing and its all tropical plants.
"This is one of my favorite place that i will surely comeback. It's such a magical place and definitely the place when you want to relax, and rejuvinate. In the night, you will see light attraction of this place and will see beautiful night scenery of singapore from sky bridge. Don't miss the musical light show! :) Love Love Love this Place!"
"Everytime my friends or my visitors to visit me in here, I alwasy bring here to amaze them , that how beautiful it is."
"What an amazing place, especially if you are into plants. There are 3 domes each with its own eco system. There are some spectacular waterfalls as well.You can also go into the floral fantasy, which is a truly magical place and was our favourite part of the gardens. In the floral fantasy garden there is a 4D simulator which is not to be missed as its really good fun!"
"Staying at MBS l was fortunate to have a room with views over the sprawling Gardens by the Bay and its supertree Grove of metal trees up to 50 metres tall and the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest conservatories. Unfortunartely it was raining quite a bit during my stay so inbetween other sight seeing and the rain, l was able to walk through the gardens. Look for the many sculptures and visit the Heritage gardnes of lndia, Malay, Chinese and Colonial. The whole area is tranquil to relax and wander. Unfortunately due to stong winds the Supertree walk was closed. Then you have the two domes, l would say if you have a couple of hours to spare the two are well worth a visit and worth the 28sgd entrance fee. I was a little worried when l entered the coridoor of the Flower Dome as it was just huge pictures of flowers...oh this is not what l expected. Then you walk into the open Dome and the visit begins your eyes darting around all the flowers and foliage. I was there at the beginning of December so a Big Christmas theme was going on. Huge Cnristmas trees festooned in even bigger baubles. Ponseti plants in rows and rows the variation of colours l have never seen apart from red and white. Look for the wooden animals and birds carved from tree trunks. Onwards to the Cloud Forest. Its amazing how cold it is in here. What hits you first as you walk in is the worlds largest indoor waterfall spilling down from a 35 metre high 'mountain' covered in vegetation of all types. An elevator will take you to the very top of the mountain to what they call the lost world from there you do the Cloud Walk, walking down ramps around the mountain, the plants changing as you go to give you the feel of different altitudes. They do misting every two hours which makes it feel like you are in the clouds in the rain forests. Again even the architecture is awe inspiring, how can they have built all this glass and solid steel structure without any concrete is unbelieveable. The ground level has sections with Pitcher plants (fly eating), ferns and a fabulous orchid area ..my favourite plant. You leave though the secret garden with plants from cave enviroments and the tiny orchids so small you peer through magnifying glasses to see them. If you want to learn more about either of the Domes a free 15 minute guided tour is available on request.. the usual gift shop before you leave is there but take a look as not your usual things that get put in a drawer when you get home....unusual T shirts some made out of bamboo material, nice books, real pressed flowers in glass. I would recommend this as a place to visit whilst in Singapore and is good for hot days or rainy days."
"Love this place stunning day and night, could easily spend all day here,so much to see and do would love to come back one day."
"Everyone in the whole family should experience this location..Out of this world.The architecture on its own is worth a visit. And then you have the Metallic Trees with a viewing platform at the very top, located at the entrance to the Flower House and the Cloud Forest... Truly amazing....."
The visit was more beautiful than expected! Nake sure to also see the light show in the evening! We were lucky to also stay at the Marina Bay Sands and have a view over Gardens by the Bay and watch the show from the 38th floor balcony and I'm telling you...once in a lifetime experience!
A must to visit if you come to Singapore. This place is absolutely gorgeous filled with colorful flowers from around the world. It has a Zen-like vibe if you want to relax and wash your eye strains away.
"One of the most beautiful places I have ever visited. I have been holidaying in Singapore for over 10 years and I never miss a visit to Gardens By The Bay.Please make it part of your schedule, it's too good to miss."
"one falls in love with this place simply for its elegance, display, and aesthetic beauty.under one roof one can see and experience the flora and fauna of almost he entire universe.entry fee is there."
"This is free and the most amazing thing to do. It really is just magical. We went through the day, it was nice but nothing breathtaking. Although as it turns dark this place is just so incredible. It literally sends shivers down your spine it is so unreal. As t turns dark there is music and all the tress light up in line with the music. It is just unreal and moving. We paid a very small amount to walk the sky walk, you are above the trees and have a great view, although it is just as good on the ground looking up! There are two light shows per night and we stayed for both, one on the sky walk looking down and one on the floor looking up, both equally amazing. There are places to eat here too, mainly fast food but very very cheap! This was the most amazing thing to do - if in any doubt just do it - but make sure you visit at night to see the light shows."
"I have never seen such beauty in my life. The waterfall was amazing, the free plant areas were well maintained, and the restaurants were fairly priced. Will certainly go again next time I'm in Singapore. Need to see the night lights view!"
Recently visited Singapore and went to Gardens by the Bay. It's a must see both during the day and especially at night. Don't expect to be there for only a couple of hours as there's so much to see and photograph.
"Only a short time in Singapore we had to see this.. from our hotel (Conrad Centenial ) it was jsut a short drive by taxi. we had been told to lay down on the floor when we got to see the light show which starts about 21:00 , its very strange and at first was unsure but...when we entered the area fr the light show everyone was laying on the floor !.....Anyway we did the same and the show was fantastic for nearly an hour we hd opera and lights which was truely something we had not seen anywhere before... it was very emotional....Prior to the light show we paid to go through the other floral exhibits..buthe light show was so amazing...if there is only a short time for your stay in Singapore ou have see the light show..."
"The gardens by the bay has many free gardens but the main attraction are flower done, cloud forest and ocbc skyway. Must see attraction."
"It's a great idea to spend half day (afternoon preferably) at Gardens by the Bay on one hot & humid day. The place is very tranquil and cool with great variety of flowers, all in one place. Staff are very helpful too."
We explored the cloud forest during a rainy afternoon in Singapore. It was the perfect way to spend a rainy afternoon. The clouds eventually cleared and we walked around outside too. A beautiful park and tourist attraction!
"Early day arrival allowed a quiet walk through these wonderful gardens and flowing waters. Learn about the plants or just enjoy the beauty in one of the most lush, expansive and fantastic indoor gardens in the world."
This is well worth the money to see over this area. We spent the whole day here and found it very interesting.
"It's a must see, It's so impressive how they managed to engineer and construct the buildings and interiours, there's a massive amount of attention to detail. We bought our tickets via Klook so saved some money doing so!"
There are many beautiful places to take pictures and enjoy. Learn about different types of plants all over the world.
Well worth a visit. All under cover and air conditioned so comfortable to walk around. The display was amazing.
"It was quite pretty and beautiful, the place was clean and it's a nice environment. The flowers were unique and pretty."
"The promotion was great! Managed to visit both domes at a steal price of $10. The team did well in terms of crowd control (especially during this time) and taking the necessary precautionary measures so that visitors are still able to enjoy the Gardens. The Sakura event was also a great exhibition for visitors to experience it (given that we can't travel =')) Overall, would recommend it!"
The Sakura Matsuri was a good alternative for cherry blossom viewing due to travel restrictions. The cancellation of events actually made the place more pleasant as it was less crowded and more comfortable to walk around. It would have been nicer if there were more photo taking opportunities as most of the displays were cordoned off.
"This complex is a ""must see"" if visiting Singapore.Beautiful gardens built around Towers of plants that are spread over the complex.Water fountain complex great for children.Our grand daughter just loved it.You must come back at night to see the Sound & Light show.World class"
"We must have walked 10 km in the city prior to reaching this area and despite the heat, took our time to take in the sites and the educational posts about the area."
"Great day out for all the family , to explore and enjoy this man made phenomena . Spacious park allows you to wander around and appreciate the layout ,plants and variety of trees. Visit the huge garden houses, walk the high level walkway all good fun and fascinating ."
"The area has different zones of plants and in intresting architecture - worth going to, but take 2h plus, not to beeing in rush"
This was a wonderful place that you could keep coming back to over and over. Surprisingly cool inside it was a welcome oasis on a hot day.
"We spent all day there. Arrived at 10.30 and left at 9pm. A great day out, and a real pleasure to visit. The domes were both great, but did prefer the Rain Forest. The light show is a must, and we found a great quiet point to view it from. Do one of the busy domes first, we did one before lunch and one after. Its a long day, lots of walking and when we went very hot, so do pace yourself. There are s number if outside gardens tk walk around, so dont miss them out."
We went to Gardens by the Bay and spent the whole day there admiring the different sections of the park. This place is huge and we visited parks of the park that nobody was there. We also ended up going to the cloud forest dome and Flower Dome. I really loved the Cloud Forest the best from the 2. This place is so beautiful and we went up the bridge no line ups and stayed for the night show at 7:45.
If you're in Singapore this is a 'must see' destination. Allow plenty of time to take it slowly and carry water with you.
Absolutley majical. If we were there longer than two nights we would have returned. We saw the light show while on the Hop on Hop off tour.Words can't describe how beautiful it was.I definatley would have wanted to return if we had more time to spare.
This is an amazing place. There is so much to see and do here. The light show at night was awesome. Best to start your trip here around 3.30 to 4pm then you can wait around for the light show that's starts at 7 I think.
This attraction is a must see. Great during the day but go around 6.30pm for the light and music show. Greta photo opportunities.
Simply amazing and a must see especially at night. It is truly magical at night they played opera music and had a light show in the super trees and best of all it's free. During the day I went to both domes and they are truly incredible. We did do the skywalk and that was a lot of fun seeing everything below us all the incredible shrubs and beautiful palm trees. It's a short walk over to the Marina Sands Hotel and we had a blast going up to Spago's for a beer.
"This place is huge. You need at least half day if not more to take the time to walk around. Two domes were great, so many different types of plants under the same conditions. They are also air conditioned which was enjoyable as Singapore is quite hot and humid. They do have a shuttle bus which you can get on and off around the huge grounds to look at other areas. Best to buy your tickets online if you can otherwise you will need to line up for sometime to purchase your tickets."
It's possible to see cherry blossom in Singapore when you visit gardens by the bay! Inside is very cooling and fresh
"The domes here are a must visit. Enjoy the flowers in the air conditioned dome and get a relief from the Singapore heat. You can take a stroll here in the comfortable temperature. Super trees look super futuristic and the view at the skybridge is amazing. Stay till 8pm for the lightshow, its worth it!"
"I absolutely loved this place, so much I went back for another day. It enchants, inspires and woos. My mouth was open for much of my visit and if my feet hadn't been so tired I would have walked right around and gone in again. Do not miss this!!! I stayed at Marina Bay Sands due to ease of visiting here, it was right next door!"
"What an incredible place to visit. This place is recommended a 100% if you are in Singapore. We walked the whole garden (the free area) and bought tickets for both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, and the experience was incredible! Although crowded because of the Chinese New Year, the installations were very well organized, clean and amazingly designed. We couldn't see the night show in the Supertree Groove, but we hope to see it next time. My personal recommendation: take a jacket to get inside the spaces, it's a bit cold!"
just like in crazy rich asians it was as beautiful and testimony to the architecture and creativity of the country. I loved the ability to walk around and feel I as immersed in nature
"If you haven't already visited Gardens by the Bay it is a must see. I brought my parents there and we loved it. The Cloud forest and Flower dome are fantastic. One of a kind and worth the entry fee. Many people go there to relax and to workout - cycling, jogging, walking and see the otters."
We visited here day and night the domes were fantastic especially the cloud forest. The light and sound show in the evenings were impressive.
Very impressed with the setup and effort to make the experience enjoyable. Great signage to guide from one attraction to another
"This was an interesting experience to visit the Gardens and is fresh new take on Gardens and a quick escape from the concrete jungle that is Singapore. Perfect for families and everyone to visit. My family and I had such a great time visiting the attractions that they had with the beautiful Cherry Blossom and Peach Blossoms , even with the virus situation, it was very beautiful and a great overall experience. Staff were very friendly and helpful and its an amazing place to take great photographs! Definitely need at least 2 hours to spend here and the light show rhapsody is absolutely spectacular!"
"There is so much to see at the Gardens by the Bay. Entry is free to the main gardens, but there is a fee for some of the attractions (we visited the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome, both of which were worth the fee). Apart from the beautiful gardens and plants, there are also some wonderful sculptures tucked away throughout the gardens, some unexpected wildlife (we spotted a large iguana crossing a road ahead of us) and a food court (Satay by the Bay), which offered a selection of reasonably-priced food. There is a shuttle service that costs $3 per person and this entitles you to use the shuttle multiple times during the day. The nightly Light & Music show at the Supertree Grove is something that shouldn't be missed!"
"Beautifully laid out gardens, a very nice place to go for a stroll. Congratulations should go 5o the gardeners, they keep the gardens in a beautifully neat and well presented state."
"Beautiful place for the family to spend a day out together, my little girl said it was a lovely experience !"
Beautiful cherry blossoms in the flower dome. Great Japanese Tori Gates and Japanese artefacts for photo taking.
Love the cherry blossoms at Gardens by the Bay! The pretty flowers came in so many different shades and they were in full bloom when we were there! Definitely loved the display!
"It was an amazing experience. I love the flowers in the flower dome, I feel like I was in Japan. The cloud forest was fantastic creation. The super tree OBSERVATORY, it was a breathtaking view of the marina bay plus the elevator was so cool. The experience was unforgettable."
"I was amazed at how well decorated everything was. When I went there, I was proud to be Singaporean!"
"Shouldn't miss this if you love flowers & nature. Easy to access using MRT, alight at Bayfront Station in Downtown Line (Blue). Don't forget the Floral Fantasy & it's 4D show."
"Free for those who just want to enjoy the nature, pay entrance to Flower or Cloud Dome if you want air-conditioning."
"It's my second visit to the yearly Sakura Matsuri at Garden by the Bay. I had a pleasant experience. It will be a good visit with your family and friends.I joined the guided tour for the Sakura Matsuri. The guide is friendly and knowledgeable.I had a Hanami Experience. I got to wear a Yukata and drink some Sakura Sake. The sake is sweet and smooth, really nice. I also got a Hanami Pack. It consists of a pack rice crackers, a leaf wrapped glutenous rice ball and a bottle of green tea.i spent around 1.5hr at the flower dome looking at beautiful flowers and layout. It's really a nice experience for me. Thank you for hosting the Sakura Matsuri."
"Went to view the sakura cherry blossom at Flower Dome. Paid only $4 per person under Medeka pgm. Beautiful beautiful. Not many ppl at the gdn, just a handful. Most are locals n really appreciate the place to ourselves. Well maintained place. Plants are well kept."
"Short taxi ride from my hotel, enjoyed an hour or so, then onto Marina Bay Sand Hotels for a rooftop drink :)"
A good way to spend 2-4 hours with the family.You will need to be there in the twilight to see one of the excellent light shows.
"Having seen pictures I was keen to visit and it didn't not disappoint. The gardens are very well kept and all of the indoor exhibits are great to see and a photographers dream. It is worth visiting both in the day and at night to see the light show,"
"A fabulous place to visit. A must if you love flowers, pkants and trees. Peaceful and relaxing. A real pleasure to visit and really inexpensive."
"The dome gardens were absouletly fantastic, the different range of plants unbelievable, but the winner on the day was Fantasy garden OMG magnificent, then the 3 D movie at the end just topped it off, brilliant."
"Firstly we did the walkway costing $8 the views over Singapore were stunning looking over to the new Marina Bay Sands hotel and over the gardens area and Singapore. We did the Flower Dome next - unbelievably stunning never knew there were so many different exotic flowers and the sculptures were fabulous. We then did the Cloud Forest which is just like an air conditioned greenhouse, waterfalls flowers and plants beautiful. We took the lift up 6 floors and walked down the walkway amazed at all the plants. It is so well done it definitely is a must to see. ."
This place is spectacular! Especially during the FREE light shows which are conducted at 7:45 & 8:45 nightly.
A luxurious setup if you were to consider the fact that Singapore has an average temperature of 28 year round
We wandered Gardens by the Bay and did visit one of the domes. We had visited both a few years ago. There are quite a few paid options available in the gardens so it probably pays to work out beforehand exactly what you want to see. Google is very helpful on this regard.A must see if you're visiting Singapore.
"Visited Cloud Forest and Gardens domes. Both very interesting, and nice to enjoy cooler temperatures. However, the light show with music is the real highlight. Absolutely spectacular and memorable. We went twice during our 3 night stay in Singapore, Absolutely essential thing to see."
"There is a 50% promotion for Singapore Residents, valid up to 29 March 2020. I purchased the ticket for Attraction Bundle 2 (Two Conservatories + Floral Fantasy + Shuttle Service).As the attractions are enclosed and air-conditioned, it was a pleasant and cooling experience to leisurely enjoy the beautiful flowers and landscaping. Allocate at least half a day to visit the 3 places."
"excellent, a little expensive, but do pay for the tram ride, it is a long distance between features in the heat and humidity"
"I had the opportunity to visit both the Gardens By the Bay as well as the Cloud Forest. I believe you should do both. The Gardens were great, and it was a perfect activity to do on a warm muggy day. It is air conditioned insode. It smells amazing, like a walk in the park, and the intricacy of the gardens is something to behold."
"There are several parts to Gardens by the Bay and they are each incredibly beautiful. The 2 nightly music and light shows in the grove of giant artificial trees are awesome for anyone. Kids, adults everyone would enjoy the show. The 2 domes are fantastic especially for anyone who's into flowers and plants. My partner thought it was pretty cool but wasn't wowed like I was. We rushed the dome to get out for the tree show so leave time for everything it's a big park."
"I went to Gardens by the Bay both during the day and at night. Evening shows are a must to see, make sure you come a bit earlier to pick up a good spot lying down :)"
"We went to the Gardens by the Bay for about 5pm. We toured the flower dome and cloud forest which were stunning. We then had something to eat, and took in the 7.40pm light and music show in Supertree Grove. It was stunning. We lay on the grass, as all the seats were taken, and soaked in the whole ambience, would heartily recommend."
We love visiting the Gardens every season. The blooms and landscape never fail to amaze us. One of the must-go attraction in Sg
with flower display for different seasons this is definitely a must go place for flower photographers and lovers. They imported cherry blossoms for this spring season which is really beautiful and they are also having a Japanese matsuri event.
"There could be no better way to begin our Singapore trip than by visiting the Gardens by the Bay as we did. When buying the tickets there are options to pick from (for the paid areas) and we chose all. It was worth the cost (itself highly reasonable) considering that we spent half a day there, lost in wonder and amazement at the varieties of trees and shrubs, plants and flowers, from the world over, which we got to see up close and personal. One can saunter or hurry through as one wishes, linger on in places of particular delight, take a gazillion photos of one's own choosing or in the many attractive settings created for the purpose, and there are no visible monitoring agents to curb one's style. Besides the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, we visited the Floral Fantasy, and finished off with an operatic concert at the Giant Trees. We also experienced the magical lake and several theme gardens (Indian, Chinese and so on) along the way from one area to the next. There aren't sufficient words to describe Singapore's Gardens by the Bay...just don't miss it when you go!"
So lush and vibrant! So very beautiful! So many plants and flowers to admire and appreciate. Well managed and kept. Highly recommended!
Gardens by the Bay is very good. very clean and beautiful. It is great by day or night. Night is better.
We visited here on our first night in Singapore. The light show an music is quite mesmerising. A real experience not to be missed.Highly recommended
"Will be visiting every year during sakura season as the event was very well displayed, and can see cherry blossom in Singapore only during this time."
"visited the city garden during convid 19 outbreak. Because it's Singapore, felt very safe. They had many measures including making the place not so crowded. The Sakura and cherry blossoms event is so pretty! It's quite cooling in the 2 domes. Just a hint, purchase the tickets online instead of queuing at the ticketing area!"
"Visiting the gardens was one of the highlights of our stay in Singapore. The variety of plants, trees etc is incredible and they are all so healthy.The cloud forest and flower dome were well worth the reasonable entrance charge, the lower temperature, essential for the plants was a welcome break from the humidity,A lovely way to spend a morning."
One of the best things I have ever done. We went to the night show and ended up staying for the later one too. It's amazing.
"Visit 3 places namely Flower Dome, Cloud Forest & Supertree Groove. Everything was so beautiful, clean & well maintained. I love love love Cloud Forest. Sakura Matsuri wasn't quite up to my expectations because I visualised it to have more Sakura trees."
"We were in Singapore on a two day stop over between Sydney and London, staying at the fantastic Fullerton Hotel, just across the other side of the bay.We were recommended to visit the gardens by the concierge, from the hotel it was only a $7 taxi ride, and $28 each to visit the biodomes and the huge grounds, it total area is 250 acres, it's impossible to see all of the gardens in one day, the sheer size, and 33 degrees of heat will make it unpleasant, so pick the parts you want to see, and do as much as you can.It's a fabulous place, and a must see whilst your in Singapore."
"Loved it here, especially exploring the coolness of the Cloud Forest and its many variety of plants and flowers. I especially loved going into the Flower Fantasy dome and getting that hit of floral scent which you unfortunately do not get nowadays. It's a great place to visit for families and a must see when visiting Singapore."
"Singapore trip will be unsuccessful without visiting here. garden by the bay area has flower dom and cloud forest side by side. you need 4-5 hours to finish both doms, if you are not interested in photography and just want to enjoy ambiance then may be you will save some time. both dom you can visit in a day multiple time until you exit totally."
Flowers were pretty and atmosphere was pleasant for a sakura matsuri when one can't be in Japan now to enjoy it. Worth visiting and for picture taking.
"Me and my wife visited Gardens by the Bay on Sat 14 Mar 2020 morning specially for the Sakura Matsuri (Tale of the Peach Boy) at the Flower Dome.The Flower Dome environment, settings, cherry blossoms variety and beauty were perfect and mesmerising. Visitors were excited, happy and graceful during the visit. This made the entire visit extremely delightful.Excellent maintenance of the plants and flower variety, cleaniness of the environment, coupled with friendly staff made this one of our most memorable trips."
"This is the first time, I brought my children ,wife n mother in law. The main visit is for the sakura festival at flower dome plus cloud forest this is the first time we visit. Also your having promotion for Singaporean from 9 March to 22nd March. Price value for visiting. After our visiting, I also share visit IMG with my colleagues n ask them to go."
"Despite the long Q, the Q was moving pretty fast and efficient. I did not have to wait for very long, and the social distancing's position was helpful."
The flowers were beautiful although not as much as expected. The range of cactus in the gardens was however much more impressive! It was not crowded despite it being a Saturday afternoon and was cool inside the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest.
"Definitely worth to spend some hours there. But make yourself ready that there are a lot of tourists. Despite that it is a really special and futuristic experience to watch the lightning tree show. You cant get lost there, because everything is well marked, and maps are available as well. Great to have your afternoon stroll there. Of course a must see, if you plan to visit Singapore!"
A great place to relax and unwind. There are many interesting plant species from around the world. And you can take a break from the heat. I would highly recommend !
"Free to enter for the most part, the two things to pay for if you wish are the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Both are super airconned and we think that's probably why they have a fee. We visited both. The Flower Dome was beautiful we spent about an hour and a half here. There are multiple sections housing plants from different areas of the world e.g. Mediterranean, Californian, the desert etc. We're not mad into plants but loved walking around and seeing it all. There seemed to be some sort of exhibition on Japanese Blossom Trees which was very beautiful. We think it was about 20$ for the two domes but we did get a discount through our hostel.The Cloud Forest was amaaaazing, theres a giant structure covered in plants with a man made waterfall! Awesome photo opportunities! You then travel up through the middle structure and work your way down through various levels and exhibitions. You can also walk along sky walkways or tree top walk ways. Very high up for the people who fear heights but you can travel down via stairs or lifts. At the bottom there was a good section on climate change and how we can help. Very informative and interactive for children. Misting of the plants happens every even hour...2PM, 4PM etc. We missed the 2PM one and forgot to hang around for the 4PM one but on exiting you get a stamp to allow you to reenter the same day if you wish, so we popped back in for the 4PM misting. Worth seeing! We spent about 1.5 hours here. We think we paid about 20$ for the two domes but we got a discount through our hostel.Outside the domes there are vast amounts of gardens housing plants from all over the world. We mainly walked through the Malay and Chinese gardens. I'd say you could spend several days getting around it all. There was an option to get shuttle buses but we just walked. The Gardens by the Bay light show is outstanding! We tried to get up to the Skywalker (?SCBC?) but the queue was too long and to be honest we reckon we got the better view from down on the ground. The theme was opera - not our cuppa tea but it was stunning to watch the lights flicker and come on with the music. The next theme until June is fantasy which means Disney! So jealous we didnt get to see that one!! To view from the ground it was free, make sure you get a good spot with the super tree in your view. You could also go up to the super tree and have a meal, no idea how expensive that would have been. I think the SCBC was about 20$. "
"Visited in December 2019.Absolutely magical experience. Must visit place specially at night to see the light show (7.45,8.45 PM) OCBC Sky walk is worth every dollar. Lot of photo opportunities.Christmas wonderland at gardens by bay in December is worth experience for every visiter in December."
"Appreciating Sakura blooming ,n different kinds of flowers too.Love the coolness n temperature of the place. Good place to visit n spend couple of hrs"
"The gardens are breathtaking, worth every cent.Better at night to avoid the heat and the supertrees light up at night to a different music theme a must see"
An absolute must visit especially at night to see the light show wow. Definitely pay to visit the domes they are incredible. A little tip if you are wAtching the light show do it from the ground and not the walkway or observation tower it's best seen from the ground looking up
I've been here twice! This place is amazing. It gives you the feels of being in the forest fresh breeze with a very nice view of marina bay sands and Ferris wheel
"Beautiful attraction, don't miss the light show which is a must see! Easy to get around, well sign posted and wheelchair friendly ammenities all around. Enjoyable so much, we went back a second time!"
"The gardens were outstanding at night and the exhibitions are stunning and quite emotional. We paid to visit Flower Dome and Cloud Dome. We aren't hugely into flowers, so Cloud Dome was our favourite and gave us a real experience of walking up high with fantastic views. Highly recommend this visit!"
Gardens by the Bay was our first port of call in Singapore and we were overwhelmed by how glorious the gardens and domes were. The experience was only surpassed by our last night in Singapore when we returned to the Gardens for the laser light show. Utterly fabulous. Not to be missed.
Awesome safe place love the personal space prevision. Spectacular place to visit and still safe. Enjoy
"We had an amazing time walking around the gardens, I would recommend that you also see them at night, once the trees are lit up, its amazing"
Everyone who visits Singapore need to visit Gardens by the Bay. Go in the afternoon and stay for the show in the evening its one of the best we have ever seen in the world!
"It's one of those places that stays in your memory because it's so beautiful, and surprising, so much attention to detail and care has been put into everything - and the staff are so very helpful! It's also thoughtful because it's considerate towards the environment, uses its own renewable resources and some areas can be accessed free of charge. I could not get enough of it and will surely visit again- it's so worth it!And in the evening, with the lights show and the gorgeous music playing - it so calming and loving- simply amazing !"
"Nice indoor garden with plant and flowers from all over the World. Amazing waterfall indoor, very realistic. Would recommend to visit."
"As a keen photographer, I couldn't wait to get here, and it didn't disappoint! Perfect for a walk with incredible views!"
You have to see this to believe how amazing it is! Must see it at night as well as the day time. The counts are fabulous
"Absolutely magical experience, buy a ticket and visit everything here. The OCBC skywalk is worth every dollar. Beware though, when there is a breeze the skywalk can sway. It looks great, feels great and the scent of plants is really nice. Lots of photo opportunities. Yes, there is a famous fast-food opportunity on site, so if you're desperate for a burger you will not be disappointed. This is a MUST DO visit. If you go home and somebody asks you whether you visited 'Gardens by the Bay' you may be embarrased if you have to say that you didn't take the opportunity."
This is a must see while visiting Singapore. We would recommend a late afternoon visit so that you can take advantage of the evening light shows and magnificent beauty of what the gardens have to offer.Be prepared for a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes. Elevators and escalators are available for those needing that type of assistance. We would recommend taking public transportation because parking is somewhat of a nuisance.An amazing attraction that is not only beautiful but entertaining for those with young children.
"Visited in March 2020. Gardens were lively especially the cloud dome, however not fro anyone is is scared of heights!Stayed for the 7.30 light show, not to be missed if you're visiting Singapore."
"Don't miss this attraction, absolutely fabulous. At dusk the lights and music show is fabulous and a great way to spend half an hour."
This is a photographers dream. Fantastic displays and flowers just waiting to be photographed. The night lights are great too.
These gardens are beautiful by day and exceptional by night. The light show is orchestrated to music and the floating globes continually change colours. This should be on everyone's to do list.
You can visit various gardens and plants of the world in this enormous glass pavilion. It is very colourful particularly at Chinese New Year.
"This is the Singaporian best answers to beautifying their city. Totally worth the price of entrance to see the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, the Supertree Grove and the many themed botanical gardens inside. This should be on everyone's itinerary for Singapore. I could spend an entire day here and almost did. The place is also beautiful at night as everything is brilliantly lit up, especially the Supertree Grove."
We loved these gardens so much we went twice. Once during the day to walk around and explore and then again the following evening to see the light show. So easy to access on the MRT. This really is a must if you are in Singapore.
A must see. Add this to your bucket list bc it is an amazing site to see in person. The free tour is fine f you don't want to pay.
"This is a remarkable place in the daylight so take you time to walk throughout the park. But the giant ""supertrees"" completely come alive after dark, especially during the 10 minute light and sound show every evening at 7:45pm, repeated an hour later at 8:45pm. The show changes every month. In March the music was opera. It's free to enter the park. Providing it doesn't co-incide with a rain ""dump"" (which can and does happen!), just find a spot under the supertrees, lie on the ground and soak it in - you won't be alone. Brilliant."
"Visited during end of February 2020. Unfortunately entry to some parts of the gardens were restricted, due to the ongoing coronavirus scare.The light show was also cancelled.Parts we did see were beautiful."
"A fantastic place to visit for free wondering around the gardens. There are charges which apply to the cooled conservatives, floral fantasy, skyway and super tree observatory but it's up to you to decide to do these. No one is forcing you to do these and the whole place is nice and calm. Plenty of places to eat and drink. There is also a small land train that you can ride on and hop and off for 3 Singapore Dollars.Easy accessible by walking also."
Absolutely stunning place and worth the visit.Stayed on for the evening light show which was well worth it.
"The gardens are a very pleasant place to visit during the day, but they really come alive at night when the light show is put on. We liked the flower dome (4 stars) but thought the cloud forest (3 stars) was a bit twee and very crowded which spoiled the effect. However the illuminated ""trees"" at night were highly original and quite stunning. They will long live in the memory. Unlike the domes, the display is absolutely free which is a top effort."
Gardens By The Bay is a large area with a number of attractions located between the Marina Bay Sands complex and the sea. It is one wonder after another. A must see for any visit.
"We like trees, gardens and opera so this light show was a highlight of our trip to Singapore.And it's free!!! So you can go again and again. LolSee it once from the ledge of rocks on the path above it and again from right underneath for a different perspective. I think I preferred the view from the upper level. We didn't go on the Skywalk so that might have been good too.It was gorgeous!"
Fabulously created. Tranquil to wonder around and take in the beauty of everything to see. I would recommend a visit.
We visited Gardens By The Bay on our overnight stop in Singapore... What an amazing place to visit. We can't wait to return and explore more of this place. Singapore in general is such a clean place. Our next stay will be longer.. Gardens By the Bay is all it is hyped to be. Don't miss out and take tons of photos as well.
Really Amazing! Your must visit guys!One of the best place in to take a moment to look at it.... totally worth it...
"The Flower Dome was also graced with Sakura, sake, kimonos and traditional Japanese theme dances. Not to be missed."
A lovely place though needs a while to see it all - we did it across 2 afternoons/evenings. Make sure you get your tickets in time especially for the skywalk.
"We love love love this spot. A must see when you are in Singapore. We are in awe with all the flora on display. The design of the building itself is a architectural genius. One of our favorites in SG. We were told that displays vary from season to season, so we will definitely be back."
"Absolutely loved the Gardens by the bay! The free evening light and sound show gave me goosebumps and I saw it at least 4 times in a 3 day stay in Singapore. The combination of opera and the supertree lighting was fabulous, I'm not sure it would be as good with say pop music. But still a must see in Singapore."
We visited the gardens both in the day and at night. In the day we only did the sky walk which was around S$8 pp giving great views on the gardens and city. It was a wonderful experience to see the Garden Rhapsody in the evening at 7:45pm / 8:45pm. My favourite place we visited when in Singapore and would highly recommend both visiting in the day and evening.
"This was not on my list however after taking the day at sentosa, i went back via marina sands and went across to look at what i thought would be outside gardens....It was literally unbelievable, pay for the extra indoor gardens and you will be amazed at what they have created indoors with a 6 storey waterfall and tropical forest from all over the world ...a great 2 hours ..and that was only the indoor area.Well done Singapore world class."
"We got to the gardens in the afternoon and had time to visit the domes, floral fantasy and have a walk around before dining at the Bakerzin cafe (excellent!!) . And then it was time for the showstopper..... the Rhapsody light show. Just stunning and beautiful. Could easily go back just to watch that. The cloud dome was amazing , but as that set the bar so high the flower dome was probably not as amazing. But they were about to set up a new display the next day. Floral Fantasy was just truly beautiful and we really loved the Flight of the Dragonfly 4D show.the only tip i have is to make sure you check the closure days of the domes before you go - they close to change displays"
"The Gardens themselves are free to visit and to get the most from the day (yes you really need to allow a day to enjoy all the gardens have to offer) we first took the shuttle cart to Floral Fantasy. We bought a combo ticket for this building, the Flower Dome and Cloud Mountain. Floral Fantasy was fantastic - beautiful flowers and lots of orchids. Globes of flowers 'danced' up and down from the ceiling in a synchronised rhythm and it was all so immaculately presented. Then to the Cloud Mountain where you feel you are inside a rain forest and can work your way up the mountain and across suspended walkways. After lunch we did the Flower Dome which had Chinese New Year displays and glorious dahlias. After that we bought tickets to the Supertrees and took a lift inside the tower and then walked out at high level between the other towers. Great view of the gardens and also out to a cruise ship in the Bay. We had been a previous evening to watch the show from the Marina Bay Sands but unfortunately it has been cancelled for the foreseeable future because of the Coronavirus threat."
"We didn't have very much time to visit as we only had 1 day in Singapore from a cruise ship and had loads we wanted to do, but we were able to spend an hour or so to get a feel for the gardens. We walked across to the gardens from the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The gardens are so beautiful and with so little time there and so much to see we couldn't really do them justice, but we went on the skywalk that gave us lovely views so we could see a fair amount without having to walk too far. This is definitely somewhere we would like to spend a lot more time at if we are lucky enough to get back to Singapore some day."
"Gardens are my thing so I spent all day from 9am to 8pm here. I got the multiple attraction ticket and went from the Floral Fantasy exhibit - almost empty at 9am, which included the flight of the dragonfly ride.I enjoyed the flower dome and the cloud forest before taking a break for lunch. Then it was on to the shuttle around the garden and the skywalk. I revisited the domes for the misting and evening lighting effects before enjoying the evening light show. My kind of day"
Was so moved by the beautiful light show. The whole experience to the gardens was delightful!! Highly recommended!!!
"If there is a definite must-visit place in Singapore whenever friends come to visit, I'd always bring them to Gardens by the Bay at night. The domes are better to visit in the day to avoid the heat and get natural lightning, but the super trees ought to be visited at night. There are two night light/music shows every day in the evening at 745pm & 845pm. This is a definite must-see when you're here. I've been here more than 5 times at different months and never once was I bored with the magical lights. Spectacular indeed!"
"To see really.The greenhouses are magnificent. They are air conditioned which makes the visit much easier. Splendid excessive decorations. And for orchid lovers, this is paradise.In the evening, attend the spectacle of light games on the trees."
"The experience was almost overwhelming with the 3 glass complexes and different, beautiful, peaceful gardens around them. Floral Fantasy was an exquisite and unusual artistic series of artistic floral displays. Although my wife loves gardens her enthusiasm was understandable. I was not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did.Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome also provided unusual ways for easily experiencing a wide range of plants and flowers. The first was a concrete artificial 'mountain' demonstrating the different trees and plants that grow at different altitudes and provided the environmental experience to go with it. The second had trees, plants and flowers, in continental zones.I cannot share more photos to demonstrate the experience.There are also 2 large food courts in which to relax, eat and drink and share either more western or more Asian meals.An excellent way to spend a full day."
A must do in Singapore. Absolutely stunning gardens. It's soIcg retail and hard work that goes in maintaining this place.A piece of advice take a shall or long sleeve blouse or jacket as the domes are air conditioned and it's pretty chilly in there!
Gardens by the Bay is absolutely drop dead gorgeous. You wont believe your eyes! Beautiful beyond belief. Every time we turned a corner is was more stunning. We could not stop taking pictures. Allow plenty of time to see this!
"You can visit 70% of the park without paying any ticket and it is beautiful, it is plenty of art and flowers. Then if you want to have an unforgottable experience Floral Fantasy it is amazing. Perfect for photoshooting. A bit chilly in the two big domes that anyway deserve to be seen, especially the cloud forest one. It is incredible what they built there. A fantastic way to spend 5-6 hours in Singapore!"
A really fantastic place. Be sure to visit the garden inside the glass dome. There are several gigantic natural crystals on display.
Fabulous place to spend time and eat too not too expensive. We had some lovely Satay while waiting to watch the evening light display
Sooo beautiful gardens and amazing engineering projects. We have visited gardens with my father and we really enjoyed this place. It is interesting collection of plants and beautiful designs.
"A lovely place to visit with a air-conditioned atmosphere to suit both plants and humans, there is plenty of places to grab some food and drink you need supplies as the areas are vast."
"These gardens are unique that so much of it has been man-made to mimic natural sites. Singapore attractions rarely disappoint, and Gardens by the Bay maintains the standard!"
"An extraordinary place day or night, when it's all lit up . There is a half hour musical light show twice a night ,not to be missed! Easily accessible by the MRT underground ,bus ,taxi or grab taxi . The covered gardens are superb but can get very busy at the weekend and evenings ! There are a number of air condition eating establishments. It's one of a number of must see places ."
nice place for families and friends. Regularly having events which makes people coming back for more.
"It's absolutely beautiful there. The tall tree like ornament, the cloud dome, I was astounded by the beauty of it and how much it tells us of the effects of climate change. The video at the end of the walk round the cloud dome seemed a bit preachy but now a days we need to lay it on thick to drive into peoples head the way we're going is not ok.I absolutely loved it"
"I must say that this is truly a must visit garden and flower dome in Singapore. With tall trees and very iconic background of Marina Bay. So beautiful and I'm amazed by the concept, family with kids will love it for sure. Friendly and helpful staff. The night show was spectacular."
"So colourful, the lighting at night was amazing. Staff are kind and helpful. I would love to return one day."
Its an altogether different experience to visit this place. So good and so different sort of plantations and the supergroove tree structures are really amazing. They have a show in the evening for 15 minutes and all the trees come alive and the colors and aura is altogether spectacular.
Shouldn't be missed as it's one of a kind . Make it high on your list of must visit attractions. There are 2 enclosed buildings with each having very different experiences. Remember to take a lot of photos as some exhibits are seasonal and changes all the time. Great for families and couples.
"Allow yourself plenty of time as you need to visit during the day to visit both domes and at night to see the light show. We split it over two visit and did Satay at the bay before the light show, a great night.Satay by the Bay in relatively inexpensive and a great selection of food options."
"WE used the MRT to get here - stops right over the road.We did the Floral Fantasy with Flower Dome & Cloud forest Dome plus shuttle.Just beautiful, hard to find words to descibe the amazing work that has been done here.We returned another night for the light & sound show which was equally beautifulGood Places to eat & rest if required. Highly recommended!"
"Gardens by the Bay is one of the premier attractions in Singapore--for tourists and locals alike. It is gorgeous, full of special beauty spots. The indoor gardens are incredible with their variety of plants. You can easily spend a day or two in the area."
"Other than the domes are air conditioned - so a way of escaping Singapore's sometimes oppressive heat the displays are fabulous. Make time to go to the gardens at night the light shows are terrific and ""mushroom"" like structures by day are nice but at night when light up its magical"
"I've been to the Gardens several times, usually with out of town friends. I never tire of the experience. Leave it to Singapore to create such a beautiful environment in the middle of the city. You have to go and see for yourself."
"Garden by the Bay, is a must see to everyone . It is just too lovely! Beautiful colourful flowers & trees. This Garden is so huge. Fret not , if you are thirsty or hungry , there is Mc Donald Restaurant for you."
"From the moment you step into the entrance way of the gardens, you are immediately immersed into a world where the city crowds and roads and modern buildings scattered throughout the city are forgotten. Nature takes over completely in a magical world where beautiful man-made structures sit side-by-side in harmony with the natural world.The flower dome and cloud forest dome are a must-see - you could easily spend a whole day exploring the different world zones, displaying their array of a stunning selection of flora. Bonus surprise - the domes are air-conditioned providing a wonderful respite from the hot tropical sun!It can be very crowded, but it's a small annoyance that dissipates as you focus on the real stars - the amazing natural world."
"Beautiful gardens, which apparently change according to season. It was coming up to Chinese New year when we visited - so many of the exhibits were to do with that. Lots of statues and the many wood carvings were amazing."
"I totally recommend visiting the two domes, you will not regret it.The night light show was spectacular. It lasts only 15 mins, but it is worth the wait."
"A must see- Cloud Forest extraordinary, flower house good, Illuminated trees breathtaking. The whole experience was fantastic & well managed. Good job Singapore"
"These gardens are a must see for anyone and everyone. We visited both of the temperature controlled conservatories.The Flower Dome was beautiful and featured gardens from the Mediterraneum and semi-arid regions of the world. But our absolute favourite was the Cloud Forest Dome. From its 30 metre tall waterfall to the plants it was a true work of art. There were alsorts of plants from orchids to carniverous , so something for everyone. We explored some of the gardens outside but as it was rather hot 34c most days we didn't see as much as we would have liked."
"Such an amazing experience! On my last visit to Singapore, the Gardens by the Bay was under construction, and what an interesting destination. Such a diverse range of plants, and beautiful orchid co[[ection"
This is a must see in the city . beautifull created park and indoor gardens -- the Cloud Forest was fantastic.
It's a free attraction (unless you decide to visit the dome) way worth the visit! Beautiful garden and an amazing light/music show at night (around 20h30).
"We LOVED the Gardens by the Bay. Aside from all the beautiful displays, wealth of information and nice views of the city, we also enjoyed learning about Singapore's initiative to become a city in a garden. Highly recommended. Definitely buy a ticket to see the Cloud Forest. this was my favourite."
"Thoroughly enjoyable visit. The variety of plants and the layout of the walkways ensure an interesting, peaceful and educational visit. During our visit I lost my sunglasses. Fortunately, they were handed in by a member of the public and returned to me that evening by the Visitor Centre staff Eshal and Nabilah. - excellent service. This capped off a fine day out at the Gardens."
We did this by the day and night I highly recommend that you do the gardens tour it's not that expensive but it was well worth it. We then went back for the evening light show which takes place at 7.45 every night to opera music and is free of charge this again is a must whilst visiting this amazing country
The gardens were an incredible experience and worth every minute! We really enjoyed the beauty and the art put into it!

Address:18 Marina Gardens DriveSingapore 018953 Tips:- Day time tour can be really hot so it would be best to wear comfy clothes such as a dress, t-shirt, and jeans or shorts and a pair of sneakers. - Bring a bottle of water as it could be very hot to walk around OCBC Skyway during the daytime. - The best time to visit is late afternoon but it could be very crowded with tourists as it is the peak time. - Sched your trip during the weekdays to avoid the huge influx of tourists during weekends and holidays. - Late afternoon could be very great to witness the transition during daytime and nightfall. Check the schedule of shows that normally happens during the evening. - Don't forget to bring your best cameras to capture great moments during your visit. - Prepare your feet to ache if you'll walk around especially if you'll go to Marina Bay Sands before or after your visit. Gardens By The Bay is indeed an amazing place to visit and I'll surely come back here in the nearest future to explore more of it!"
Very refreshing environment!! Very clean and a lot of things to do nearby. To recommend visit
Thoroughly enjoyed our stroll here. I would highly recommend everyone to visit here. Nice place to spend quality time with the family.
"Garden by the bay, Singapore is a must visit tourist attractions. There is a whole new world. The entire range of flora and fauna can be seen. You must devote at least half day to explore it. There are different sections, all to be visited one by one."
We went here twice once during the day and again in the evening for the light show. I loved every moment for it. I am not a gardener but I found it fascinating. The decision and execution is first class. A real credit to the city
"Went here intentionally for a couple of hours, ended up staying for 7 hours! Absolutely beautiful. Most of it is free but the cost for some things was worth it, around $40 for the Cloud forest and Flower dome. I stayed until dark because thats when the place comes alive, a light show with music- just amazing!"
Amazing place to be when weather is hot and humid. a place to see beautiful seasonal flowers. Feel refreshing and energizing for the rest of the day in this cool environment. Good for selfie too.
"Serene, stunning structures such as the supergrove trees and beautiful flowers, and inside waterfalls worth buying tickets for the 2 domes."
These gardens are like no other very tropical and lush with many features.The light show that is on every night was cancelled due to the virus however there is so much to look at.The gardens are accessible from the hop on hop off bus Marina Bay Sands stop.Plan on spending some time and enjoy all the features!
Spent several hours here whilst in Singapore. It has got to be one of the best attractions I've visited. The Cloud Forest. Floral Fantasy and the Flower Dome were amazing.The main attraction being the light show in the super tree grove at night time. Definitely a must see.My only issue was the lack of a decent restaurant. It was all fast food. At least that is all we could find.A must visit attraction.
Visit the Grdens by the Bay free light show. It is amazing. There are 2 shows nightly. Get there early and get a position under the main tree with the restaurant at the top. Lie down and watch a fabulous light show all done to some operatic music.
We have visited 3 years ago but wanted our friends to experience it. It was just as good this time and so much to look at. It was very quiet due to the conravirus so we could take our time and take everything in.
This place was really great. Only sorry that I only had time to visit in the day. Definately something I could have spent more time at
Especially the Cloud Forest by day and the Super Trees by night! Appreciated the strong educational environmental message too.
"This is a beautiful addition to the things to see and do in Singapore. Check out the light show from the Skypark at the adjacent Marina Bay Sands resort - brilliant views of the gardens and light show ""from above""."
You could not visit Singapore without seeing these gardens. A variety of plants from all over the world.
"This was amazing. The gardens are beautiful. Even at night it's stunning. If you are visiting Singapore , you have to go here."
Go at 4pm-7.30pm for best of both worlds day and night! It's magnificent and don't miss the light show! Well worth a visit. The cloud dome is more interesting than the other but still both very impressive. A must do in Singapore!
"Loved our visit here. The plants were beautiful and really well kept and displayed. For my taste I could do without the plastic cartoon figures and it is a bit too much of a theme park rather than a botanical garden, but I still really enjoyed it.Extremely well managed as most things in Singapore, and the shuttles to get around were really useful.The cafe in the Cloud garden was excellent too."
"This was a must for us. After travelling around on the bus (a really great trip) we decided we needed to see this.Just one tip, if you want to see the light show and walk around, it's free. We bought tickets only to find out that they were for the 2 biodomes. By the time we watched the show one of them was shut. The other one was worth visiting though and it's not expensive.The actual light show was out of this world. The lights danced to classical music. You could only imagine this is what life is like on alien planets lol.Places to get food and souvenirs and easy to work your way around.100% would recommend."
"We went down for the light show in the evening, which happens twice nightly. Entrance to the gardens is free with a charge for some of the exhibitions and the sky walk. As well as the show, there is a large area to explore with many different attractions. It could be that the man made sections kind of overwhelm the natural stuff, but it is one of those iconic places that is going to be near the top of most visitors lists, and it doesn't disappoint.I would avoid the hard sell for tickets when you first arrive in Singapore and head down to see for yourself what bits you wish to pay for."
"You have to go there, truly magnificent and something you have to do when in Singapore. The music and co-ordination with the lighting is superb, brings tears to the eyes!!"
"You can walk here for hours and see so many beautiful trees, lights and shows. This is of course a must see at night because of all the lights, but even at day time it is a beautiful area."
"Do not miss this! Just world class! Unique architecture, educational and of course in gardens are spectacular!"
"A day out in the gardens surrounded by an amazing design features, Interesting information on how water is produced to water all the gardens ."
"We visited gardens by the bay and we loved it. Was so lovely to walk around, unfortunately we didn't manage to go to the super trees due to the weather conditions, however we did have a look around the cloud forest and the flower dome. They were both great, the actual gardens were amazing too. My son loved the children's garden and the eggs along the river."
"This has to be a major highlight to any visit to Singapore.... Majority of the gardens are free. But even the things you pay for are exceptional value for money.The supersize metal trees with the look out and skywalk are a must to view this beautiful garden and the skyline of Singapore. The cost to do these additional things are small and well worth every penny.Evening at the garden, at 19.45and 20.45 (check times when you visit) there is an awesome light and music show on these beautiful trees plus the eggs in the river.Lastly there are two huge domes;1) Clouded Forest- I have never see anything like this anywhere in the world. The size and scale of this dome is amazing, and the metal walkways that allow you to walk above the forest is awesome and not for the faint hearted.2) Flower Dome - tranquil, peaceful, beautiful. Amazing are some of the words that I would use to explain this other large dome next to Cloud Forest.My words and photos will not give this place justice of the shear scale and beauty of 'Garden by the Bay' Just stunning ï¸"
"Whether you to do all the attractions or just wander around and admire the gardens, sculpture and views, this is a must. Best to get off at Bayfront MRT and walk around as bridge from Marina Bay Sands may be closed."
"Had a few hours to kill in Singapore so took the SMRT to the gardens. Despite the heat, this is a worthy experience. The park is lovely to walk through with many sculptures and exhibits that are quite stunning. The paid attractions in the domes are also worth checking out - especially the cloud forest. Amazing experience, especially when the mist sprinklers come on."
These gardens should not be missed! Very easy to walk around the outside for free but worth the money to visit both the Flower Dome & Cloud Forrest. If you have children see if they can spot all the characters from their favourite books in the Flower Dome & make sure they look in the trees . The music show is free & a great experience.
"We had wanted to visit the Gardens for some time, today we were able to fulfil our dream and we were not disappointed we enjoyed all that there is to see, especially some of the endangered plants and the work that they are doing to propagate these plants to ensure there survival. We loved our time there."
Spent most of one of our days in Singapore here and stayed for the lightshow in the evening. Would thoroughly recommend this attraction
These are an essential part of any visit to central Singapore and the best bit is you can do most of the gardens for free. Located behind the Marina Bay hotel you need to navigate your way to the hotel and then go up to the cross walk bridge and go through the access point in the hotel to the gardens. There are then many ways to go to see various parts of the complex but it's great for a half day wander.
the gardens where absolutely beautiful we did the cloud Forrest walk and the flower dome both where very well maintained our favourite was the cloud Forrest with his 35 m high covered in flowers structure with a stunning waterfall .Don't forget to walk around the gardens so much to see
Gardens are excellent and the display themes well done. The waterfall is awesome and the outdoor displays tranquil.
A great set of views of Singapore and then there is enough area of gardens to last you several hours without even paying to go into the huge domes. Excellent and brilliantly laid out.
My wife and I loved this place! The flower dome and forest dome were magnificent. Indoor air conditioned domes and well maintained nature a great treat for the eyes.Unfortunately our camera died and we were not able to capture any shots. A must come back.An excellent place to go for in the evening.
Overall experience is 5 star as most of the attraction is free including the brilliant evening light and music show. The add on conservatories are maybe 4 star. The mountain one being better than the flower one but not bad value to complete the visit at about Â£16 for both.
"We had a 17 hour layover in Singapore and decided to visit Gardens by the Bay. We travel a lot and have to say it is one of the most impressive tourist attractions we have ever been to. The concept, architecture, geography, and plant life is mind blowing.My 28 year old son wasn't too keen to visit, but thought he'd keep me company and was blown away by it.We had a quick orientation of the Grounds by way of Shuttle, to hear a little about the place. This journey is not really necessary and it would be easily walked if the weather was pleasant.On the day we attended, the Skywalk was closed for maintenance. We were a little disappointed, however it gives us a reason to go back. We still managed to spend 2.5 hours here completing the audio tour and visits to the domes.The tropical setting of the Cloud Forest and the world's largest greenhouse, the Flower Dome were spectacular. Current exhibitions at the Flower Dome include a Dahlia exhibition with flowers the size of dinner plates. The Cloud Forest is host to Orchids of the Amazon and 7 levels of rainforest.The views of the Singapore skyline, including Marina Bay Sands are ideal for some great snap shots.Do yourself a favour and visit this fabulous site. Suitable for all ages. The elevated boardwalks are amazing and the waterfall and plants are incredible. It's sheer creative genius!"
"Awesome light show. Nothing like I've ever seen before. After head towards the casino and you will see another cool floating egg-like color spectacular show The show drew a lot of people so just relax, be patient and enjoy."
"Wow wow wow this is a must when visiting Singapore! Adults and children alike will be in awe of this amazing exhibition where natural world meets the technological era.Whether you like art, nature or just something different this area will appeal to everyone in one way or another.There is a small cost if you wish to do specifics in the gardens but the most magnificent being the Rhapsody by the bay where the beautiful tree Grove lights dance to beautiful music is free I was flabagasted! Even if you don't visit the domes or do the treetop sky walk visit the show it started around 19:45 every night with more showings at 9pm I think on weekends."
This is really worth a visit. It is a lovely garden of delights. Singapore is beautiful and the two sections are very different. The gift shop is unique also.
Although cloudy we spent three hours in the gardens and the domes. Try and time your visit for late afternoon to see the gardens both during daylight and in the evening when a spectacular light show illuminates the 'Super tree grove'.
Great for a walk with family. Very scenic and interesting. Lots of stuff to learn if you take time to read all the educational information. Very pretty at Christmas too. We would recommend this for a nice day out in Singapore.
Very hot for wandering around but a great day out. Lots of staff and lots of things to see. Due to current situation with carina it was also very quiet which was great for fitting everything in.
"The Flower and Cloud Forest Domes, were well worth venturing inside, definitely wait until dusk to see the light show which is impressive!"
"Don't miss this garden. It's exceptional, and air-conditioned. Great targets for the avid photographer."
"There are two domes that you need to pay to enter but they are very interesting and worth the visit. Plants of all types, flower shows, water falls, really pretty and a good way to work off all the good food we eat in Singapre."
"Love this place. Have visited several times, most recently with my family during a visit to Singapore (my kids, 10 and 6, also loved it). Find it incredibly tranquil, well laid out, and incredibly clean. The cloud forest is a personal highlight, but the flower dome is also great. Don't miss the nighttime light show - totally inspirational. Good food options as well near the super trees."
Visited Gardens by the Bay yesterday and again tonight to see light display. Well worth the visit both times. Tonight's display was to Opera and very good indeed. Next time I'm in Singapore I'll automatically watch the show.
"This was a real highlight of my trip to Singapore. The grounds are beautifully landscaped around a lake (in which we saw a whole group of Otters playing together, which was great to see close up), with loads of shaded trails to wander peacefully through, as well as some unique sights like the Cloud Forest and the 'Supertrees' (it well worth returning by night to see the light show for these."
A must watch place when in Singapore.Beautiful lush green gardens & lovely flowers at flower dome and man made fountain at cloud forest was amazing. Light & sound show was a treat to watch.Must visit.
If you are in Singapore I suggest you to visite the botanic gardens. No charge to be paid. A very relaxing place with wonderful plants and flowers. Near to the centre (20' by walk).
"It's hard to describe the scale, the detail and the diversity of this botanic theme park. Stay past sunset to see the Giant Trees illuminated."
I had done some research on this particular attraction before visiting Singapore. This is a huge attraction which has many outdoor garden areas plus the two conservatories (Flower Dome and Cloud Forest) where admission is charged. Our visit was geared towards the late afternoon as we wanted to view the Garden Rhapsody sound and light show in the evening. The park is huge and one can only stay outdoor for a limited time before the humidity and heat gets to you. Of course you can cool off in the two conservatories plus the food court area. It would probably be best if you can view this area on separate days. It is absolutely an amazing and enchanting attraction.
"A wonderful way to spend a few hours. The Flower Dome and Cloud Dome are both worth a visit and the Super Tree Grove light show each night is spectacular. Make sure you check the website before you for timings of light show, misting of the Cloud Dome etc."
OMGOODNESS!! I can't even begin to describe the flowers. There are 2 Climate Controlled Huge Domes. We first went to the Flower Dome. AMAZING! They describe it as ' a world of perpetual spring in the Largest Glass Greenhouse in the world.' The Astrological Figures were represented. There are legends on some of the plaques.The Cloud Forest Dome is also a sight to see! It is described as ' A realm high in the mountains with a 35m tall indoor waterfall with 9 discovery zones.'
"Very beautiful, quite place with different flower installations. Cafe is available inside, they are having very tasty cheesecake. Indoor area a bit cold, grab some cape."
"Visited Gardens by the Bay last week. It's an absolute must see. Two indoor areas with plants flowers and trees from all over the world. Beautifully displayed and maintained. The displays are changed every 4 mos. so always something different to see. DON,T MISS IT."
Do not miss the light show - I saw it accompanied by classical music. I also visited the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. Very educational and lots of art in the Flower Dome.
"You have to come to the gardens, allow quite along time to walk around but you won't be disappointed, we loved it!"
"The place is a must for visitors who may not be able to take the extreme heat and humidity because it offers visitors both outdoor and indoor choices and moving around is a breeze even for those with mobility problems. The outdoor OCBC Skyway, Supertree Observatory and Supertree Grove is an eye opener. For visitors who are keen to explore the indoor gardens, both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest will fascinate you with the floral display from many parts of the world and a man-made mountain and waterfall - you can take a rest at many of the seats available and take in the breathe-taking sights and fresh flora smell. The new Flora Fantasy is not to be missed with its unique floral artistry found in 4 diverse garden landscapes where you will be greeted by suspended flowering plants that ""dance"" as well as ""streams"" and a ""waterfall""."
"Gardens by the Bay are a wonderful place. From the pools that kids play in to the gorgious indoors, I highly recommend a visit."
"Good restaurants are available in the area to choose from, and great park to walk dogs and relax, will definitely visit and dine again"
"After the skyway, the adjacent gardens are a must see in Singapore. The design and layout is amazing. It's incredible to see the diversity of plants and trees in a tropical setting."
There are many kinds of beautiful flowers!!! I crazy about it and i will definately comeback soon!!!!!
What a fantastic place to visit during both day or night. We did both and would have to say that our accident of timing our evening visit to coincide with the opera light show was the best thing on our stopover in Singapore.A decent walk from our hotel or a $12 dollar taxi ride - given the heat and humidity we opted for the latter!
"It is the most recognizable area of Singapore for a reason, it was extremely nice throughout. We visited the Supertree Observatory, with extremely good views of the city, including the Sands Hotel and the F1 circuit, the Cloud Forest with incredibly cool walkways and architecture, and the Flower Dome with its displays of the world's flora, all worth the price of admission, but walking around the grounds was also extremely interesting. Absolutely a must-go when in Singapore."
"Located next to the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the gardens are a must see when visiting Singapore. There is no entrance fee to walk around the gardens and there are lots of gardens and plants to see such as the Chinese and Indian gardens.Various entrance fees are required to see inside the domes or the super trees. The cloud forest dome is amazing and well worth the entry fee, which also includes access to the Flower Dome. Separate tickets are required for the third dome and the super tree grove walkway."
"If you are a tourist in Singapore, definitely spend an afternoon in the 2 domes of the Gardens by the Bay, an architectural wonder that was only built in recent years. I especially enjoyed the variety of flower species in the flower dome and the immense man-made waterfall structure in the cloud forest! Anyway, local Singaporean here! We tend to be quite critical about things so you can trust my opinion."
"Beautiful, flowers, displays and information on so many flowers. The wood carving and themes around the gardens were very unique. Well worth it."
"Omg what a lovely morning we got there early & had a fantastic morningCloud forest was great as was the flower dome , dragonfly lake & the super treesIt's a must if your in Singapore"
"Gardens by the Bay is such a beautiful garden that highlights the modern and eco friendly Singapore. It is quite touristy, but it is very clear why. I recommend to watch the night show that from what I remember, starts at 7:30 - 8:00 pm."
One of the best experiences in Singapore. Don't miss the light show! This is a must and try to visit all the gardens.
"Whe had a good half day here during our 5 days visit to Singapore, you can easily spend 4 hours or so between the gardens and the marina shopping mall , we returned to the gardens by 7:45 to attend the amazing light show , we travelled with 3 and 5 yo and all the the family enjoyed the 10 mins show ,the show is free but if you wish to go to the super tree observatory you will need to buy I think SD 19 tickets, you can buy a Sd 3 tickets to use the shuttle between the gardens and the shopping mall in Marina bay sands"
"You can choose to walk around the gardens without cost r if you want, pay to enter the domes or the skywalk. Whatever you choose, don't rush. Savour the experience and enjoy the calm."
We went here at Gardens by the bay.Superb very well maintained.It's cover a large area covered all kind of flowers here.You can walk on the sky I felt like that.Sculpture look like tree covers with plants.Everyday evening there is fantastic lighting there with music it was just out from the world.Very nice.Superb.
"Take a break from the punishing tropical heat of Singapore and immerse yourself in a perfect climate controlled environment. I love this sci fi garden with beauty design .it is a wonderful way to spend time with some greenery and learn about various beautiful flora!Like every Singaporean would say ,' Come LAH!'"
Saw this place while on the Singapore Eye and just had to go - it is a very chilled and relaxed area - as our hotel was close by we visited both daytime and night time - also also very excited as they had recently opened the observatory at 50m above it all at a very reasonable cost. A must see when in Singapore !
This is a beautiful place. A trip to Singapore would not be complete without a visit here and the night show was just stunning.
Took the metro from our hotel in Orchard Road to the Gardens by the Bay. Not only are they exquisite but you get to have the famous Marina Bay Sands Hotel in the background of your photos too. It is a Must Do visit in Singapore.
"The place was neat,clean and bustling with lively people.There was a McDonald's too within the campus which was totally not to forget. The light show was the highlight. The brightly colored lights lit up the night sky as the music charged the atmosphere. A beautiful performance, would recommend to visit."
"Having, on a previous trip to Singapore, visited the old Singapore Botanical Gardens and the National Orchid House at Changi, we wanted to make sure we visited the Gardens by the Bay this time round. It was all we expected it to be! We took a taxi from our hotel (advised by the concierge at our hotel that this was the easiest way to get there, and also cheap - $7). Taxis come and go all the time from a designated area close to the entrance. As I can't walk very far (and it's always so humid in Singapore) we started our trip with a buggy tour. I don't remember the cost but it wasn't outrageously expensive and well worth it. For 20 minutes you get a tour of the extensive grounds, with a commentary (in English). For those able to walk further than I, this would be a good way to decide which areas you'd like to visit in more detail. We next bought tickets to visit the 2 domes - the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome. Both were absolutely beautiful - the Flower Dome has displays which are regularly changed throughout the year. The Cloud Dome has a lift, which takes you to the very top, from where you can wander down and round the central area, which is incredible! It is created using hundreds of thousands of plants, which flower in profusion and enjoy the mist from the waterfall. If you've visited and enjoyed the Eden Project in Cornwall, England, you'll enjoy this too...even if you haven't, you'll still enjoy this! There are numerous places to eat and drink within the grounds."
"Perfectly situated in the centre of most tourist spots in Singapore, Gardens by the Bay offers a getaway from the other wise hustle and bustle of the city life. It amazes me that despite the large traffic crowd that the place acquire, the location remains clean and natural."
It's a wonderful place which we enjoyed the most during our business trip in Singapore. We really loved the creative design concept and advanced technology of the lighting system.
"Even if you are not a green fingers kind of person, you still can't help but to be amazed by this,place. It really is quite an amazingly beautiful place and we enjoyed the experience."
"We visited the gardens specifically to see the light show. It was spectacular. The accompanying music was opera and was perfect. It was a fantastic experience, the best of a wonderful trip to Singapore."
"This is somewhere not to be missed, an absolutely beautiful experience. The gardens are a sight to behold. The Flower Dome, Floral Fantasy and The Cloud Forest are all superb. The Supertrees are amazing. We spent two days bimbling around and loved every minute. Just a great time spent. Visit at night and it just gives another dimension. Fantastic and we will definitely return."
"its a pity and more to a blessing in disguise that the virus is ongoing and we ahev almost the whole garden to ourselves. Garden is of world class standard and most recommended to visit if you are in the area, best to come towards the evening and avoid the sunny sun"
It was quite interesting to see all that diversity of plants in the indoor garden some of which are not native to the island. Sad though that until sometime ago most of those plants were growing freely around the island that now has been covered with concrete and tarmac. I guess in the northern areas there must still be a certain amount of largely untouched forest though. I will have to check that out next time. The outdoor gardens were also nice and pleasant to walk around. That's where the light show took place as it got dark and it was pretty spectacular. The choice of music going with it was also interesting and a nice change from the usual rhythms you hear around town.
"My wife and I were in Singapore for part of our honeymoon and visited the Gardens for the light show.We were very pleased and surprised to find out that this was a free event, considering how expensive we found the rest of out trip in Singapore.The light show was amazing, we were very glad we went."
This was our second visit to the gardens and we could not believe the many changes since our last visit. This is a must see if you are in Singapore.
"Now, this was unexpected (and in a very good way). An absolutely remarkably large, diverse dome of endangered and unique plants from around the world, in air conditioning. Really unique and wonderful....probably the most interesting thing now in Singapore, outside of the cultural districts. All of our group felt the same way - not to be missed!"
just revisited the flower dome again as dahlia were on display. not disappointed at all amazing. the displays with carved animals are breathtaking. well worth the visit
"If there's only one sightseeing trip to be done in Singapore - this is it. Beautiful gardens and loads of nice places to walk around. Light show at 7.45 pm is worth a visit. Sadly due to promise of lightening, we couldn't do the observatory walk."
Great space with a variety of attractions. Beautiful and romantic light show at nights. Botanic garden is well preserved and in full blossom.
Family vacation in Singapore! This is a must see according to my best friend-Sharon and my brother-Albert and my sister- Emily. My daughter-in-law Luxi and myself love flowers so we decided to place a visit! When we walk in see all kind of beautiful flowers and Christmas decorations also has some stand for Singapore example tricycles also the walk is fabulous and beautiful for taking pictures very cool and clean.
"An eye catching awesome place to while away a few hours, or a whole day. Stunning views, beautifully tended gardens, and just a peaceful venue. There is something here for everyone; make sure you visit in the evening as well."
"My wife and I visited here on Day #1 of our 3day stay in Singapore ... along with the domes we also booked the skywalk. The nightly light show is wonderful, the gardens are free, a must see, a wonderful experience."
"These gardens are fabulous- full of interesting sculptures and themed gardens by the river, you need at least half a day to see them all. The gardens are free but it is well worth paying to go inside the domes. The cloud forest has a huge waterfall, layers of plants and flowers, sculptures as well as a display of stalactites/mites.Music plays while you visit so it is an amazing experience. The other Dome is also full of sculpture, plants in geographical zones and a special flower area. Chinese New Year was good time to go as there were many colourful displays(Rat for this year).Then you need to go back in the evening to see the light show which is absolutely fantastic. It starts at 7.45(go earlier to get a good position for viewing) and the trees light up in time to music, an experience like no other. Take a video for replay at home. There was also a lake of colour changing balls on the way out by the Marina Bay Hotel. Follow this with the light show in Marina Bay(in front of the shopping mall) which starts at 9.00, a short walk away. Another unmissable experience, this time based on water with synchronised music, lights and fountains. You can also see this show from Merlion Park where there are good value places to eat. From there you can see the laser show but not the fountain show very clearly so you really need to see the show from both sides of the bay(8.00 and 9.00 showings). If you have only one opportunity see it from in front of the shopping mall."
"This place is amazing so many different areas,to visit. You need to purchase tickets for the places you wish to visit there. A must is the big trees especially at night to witness the musical light show. Its Breath taking."
Perfect place to just walk around and enjoy. You need to pay to visit the domes and I'd recommend it. I saw the light show from the top of the Marina Bay Sands but if I've had more time in the city I would have gone back to the gardens to see it from there.
"The gardens spread along the riverfront behind the Marina Sands hotel & are easily accessible via the metro. The gardens are a nice stroll during the day, but the lighting at night really brings them to life in a completely different way. There's also a light show with music at around 7:45 and 8.45 which is free and a must see. Very different, very beautiful and very entertaining."
"I went at dusk, so I saw the trees in daylight and then when they were in full light mode. An amazing experience"
Second time there saw the light show which was superb. The domes is the only part you have to pay for. Rest of the gardens is free.
It was a wonderful and pleasant experience. It was the first ever visit for my wife and I. And it was really fantastic
"Wish we had more time here to enjoy these amazing gardens. Only here for one night so time limited. We did see the light show just before sunset, then took the lift up to the bridge for more spectacular views when the show actually begins, a charge of 8 Singapore dollars for the lift to go up the OCBC Skyway, but worth every penny,"
MUst see !!! Breathtaking!!! It'll take you all morning so don't plan to much in the day! Food is quite expensive so I wouldn't recommend eating there.
"This is an amazing place which you can walk around all day! Although you pay to go in to the two vast glasshouses (Flower Dome and Rain Forest) the rest of the huge gardens is free entry. The ""supertrees"" are amazing and there are several places to eat. It's well worth another visit at night to see the fantastic light show (twice each night). Taxis to and from the gardens are very convenient and the queues are minimal. It's not particularly cheap to go in to the glasshouses, but certainly worth it.I visited twice in the same week and would certainly visit again...any time!"
"If you like gardens then this is a must. Huge grounds to walk around in and for a small fee the flower dome and cloud dome. The flower dome had so many plants and was massive, it took a good hour to walk around. The cloud has a large waterfall and is amazing to walk around.At 19:45 they started the light show, I won't spoil it , but absolutely brilliant.Spent over 3 hours there and wished we had gone earlier."
This place is amazing and worth the money. I'm so glad I went back! It's aircon inside so on a warm day it's exactly what you need. If you're traveling with someone afraid of heights be prepared to leave them somewhere or miss out...I did a bit of both. My favourite was the cloud dome though the flower dome had some lovely specimens in it too.
Great place for early morning walks. Very well maintained and it truly is another world. The walk to Marina Barrage is not to missed. If you have the energy you can walk across the barrage dam to the east Park.
"If you are staying in the Clarke Quay area, walk alongside river to Marina Bay, then pick up a taxi to the Gardens. The two domes have an entry fee but well worth it.If you have visited Kew or The Eden Project and enjoyed it, then this will be amazing."
Drink plenty of water as this area can be a long walk but well worth it. We had trouble finding a taxi so knowing more about the layout of the area before we went would have helped.
Wonderful Gardens with spectacular light showEasy taxi ride and easy walk to the indoor areasFun observation tower
The gardens by the bay are well worth visiting. Both domes are air conditioned and the rain forest dome is spectacular as you actually get up into the roof space on walk ways
"We loved GBB and have been here numerous times.Love the exhibition, ""Floral Fantasy"" at Bayfront Plaza.It's rather different from the two main domes at the park.There was a free exhibition beside called, ""Future Together"".Other than the free musical show at the Super Trees at 7/8pm,""Future Together"" also has evening exhibits like ""iLight Singapore"".The stretch of restaurants beside Super Trees was under reno in 2019.Glad it's reopen now with more affordable food options, like a food court.Love the new al fresco part of the food court that faces the picnic area,...fans of Peach Garden restaurant will be sad to see it's gone now.Take note of package deals and pioneer generation discounts.The cool self-drive Auto-Rider has audio guide and air-con!Best to plan your day well for this gigantic GBB park!NB: Don't miss the free water play if you've kids!Small cafe for parents to watch kids from too."
"The varieties of plants, flowers and wooden sculptures present under this roof are just amazing. Special arrangement were there for the Chinese new year. Kids loved it."
"When visiting Singapore make this a must visit. The array of plants, trees and flowers are breathtaking. It was surprisingly refreshing walking around there as I was expecting it to be humid inside. You can get a hand stamp for re entry on the same day which we did use and so glad we did as we missed some of it the first time around. It looked like you could get a guided tour through a headset as there was a sign with headphones on and a corresponding number which I presume told you about the plant you were looking at. We didn't see where you could get these from though."
Beautiful day at Gardens on the Bay! The flowers and trees were amazing. I wish we'd done the narrated tram because I was too tired to finish up the last half!
I try to go to Gardens by the Bay and the Supertrees everytime I am in Singapore. It is huge so you can't see it all in one day. We advise going twice'once during the day to go into the domes (early is less crowded) and once at night to see the trees and the light show. The light show is lovely. The domes are open at night so it's possible to do the domes in early evening and then go to the light show. There are also extensive gardens outside if you don't want to go into the domes. This is a great place for children and there are many family friendly activities.
"Another visit here, and we were not disappointed. The main displays stay the same... but obviously change with the seasons, but the theme changes regularly. This time it was for Chinese New Year, and did not disappoint. There is also a dahlia display. The cafe inside is a hidden gem for a little respite from the walking."
"Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Do yourself a favour and visit something beautiful. All the gardens were meticulous both inside the respective domes and outside."
It must be included in your attraction list if you are in Singapore.It is very beautiful and don't miss the night light show.
"Where do you start we visited the gardens in February we started at the floral dome truly enchanting. The gardens within are an amazing site captivating your vision and imagination sy=uch a varied and wondrous display, we then brought tickets to enter the two other large domes the treetop escape and lost world is just amazing to walk n the tree tops and get a sense of the majesty of the flora is great. the second dome gardens from around the world is slightly more formal from a garden arrangement but no lesser a fantastic experience with some wonderful light hearted touchesOut side the gardens are immaculate then on to the super trees they look impressive in the daylight but at night time the whole place erupts into a magical world the music and light show is a very special experience and one not to be missed. Words cannot really express the magnificence of the gardens at night. The skywalk is a need to do you are slightly rushed on the walk but that is solely so all the people can enjoy the experience.We spent the best part of a day on site we ate at satay by the bay which was great value for money and the Thai was fantastic highly recommendedOverall a great experience a must see place but give yourself time to see it all and it is good value"
Really good to watch at night. Everyone crowds on the floor for the show. Shame there was nowhere to buy a drink as we watched it but perhaps this is to reduce litter. There is a food court which we had a beer in after and there seemed to be lots of food options. The show itself was stunning and one of our Singapore highlights.
"The garden area is huge and you could spend a lot of time here. There are two enclosed gardens, the flower dome and the cloud forest. The flower dome is beautiful with exhibits of flowering plants from all over the world. At the time we visited there was a special exhibit of daliahs. The cloud forest is spectacular. A lift or stairs will take you to the top and then simply follow the winding paths back down past all manner of plants growing vertically around the central structure. There is also a water fall cascading down from the top. An additional garden display called floral fantasy was easy to walk through and enjoy flowers and a 4D movie of the gardens by the Bay Area."
Our favourite part was the cloud dome and the supertree grove. It was also nice to head into an air con garden. A must see and you will have to come back in the afternoon to see the light show!
"Once you've been here there is no need to go to any other Hortus or arboretum anymore. These gardens are absolutely stunning. Plants, flowers and trees from all over the world are gathered here. You certainly wonder how they ever got them here because many are amazingly huge. There are outdoor gardens and there is an airconditioned Flower Dome and a Cloud Forest. You van easily spend a whole day here. And don't miss the lightshow in the evening. Chapeau to Singapore for giving nature so much space......"
What an amazing place to enjoy in Singapore. We had only a limited time in Singapore so we only visited the Flower Dome and Cloud Conservatory. We will definitely visit this beautiful spot in the future. One of the highlights of our short trip to Singapore.
Lovely day out and then an evening light show . Spent 6 hours here and didn't see the whole park. Enjoy
I've been visiting Gardens By The Bay and each time I'll have a different experience all together. This place is such so great.
"We went to the show twice, because the first night we were right in the middle where all the trees were, which was incredibly cool. You really feel the music and the impact of the lights.We went back the second night and just stayed at the overlook on the walkway attached to the Marina Bay Sands. This way we got the great overall view and took some great pictures and video. Both experiences were different and terrific. If I had to choose one only, I think I'd go with being inside despite the lack of good p photo ops.The easiest way to get there is to take the walk way from the Marina Bay Sands (casino side) conveniently located near the light show over the Bay. After the light show, walk inside and go straight. About 1/3 of the way through the building, there will be an alcove with escalators up and signs for going to gardens by the bay. You will go quite far up, then cross the street well above ground, go through the other side of the Sands (the 3 tower ""boat"" side) and then you can either stay on this walkway to watch from above or go down into the park."
"Gardens by the Bay takes several hours to view sensibly. In particular, viewing the flowers and plants from the overhead walkways at least gives one the impression of space taken up by the plantings. We were unable to stay for the night displays as due back to our cruise ship, but we could view photos on the website for those aspects."
"If you love flowers, plants, and gardening, do not miss Gardens by the Bay. You will see everything from orchids to roses and everything in between. Our personal favorite was the Cloud Forest. I won't describe it to save the surprise, but it is really awe inspiring."
Incredible and free - utterly awesome! You can walk among them listening to the music and watching the lights change to the rhythm or you can walk along the sky walk - can't miss this!
"A return visit two years on but this time for the evening light show.WOW - two showings, 7.45 and 8.45. Arrive early to secure a good seated spot under the enormous trees and be mesmerised by the lights and music !!"
Arrived in time to experience the Supertree light show from beneath the trees.Simply stunning 15 minutes of lights choreographed with a medley of booming classical tracks.Loved it.
"If you come to Singapore you need to spend at least 1/2 day visiting this unique and beautiful garden. Easily accessible by MRT. The range of flowers shrubs trees are just beautiful even for a non gardener like me. My wife loves it and would return the next day. There is plenty to do. External exhibits. Sky walk. Big greenhouses for flowers, waterfalls etc. Highly recommended. Will return when we next visit Singapore"
The gardens are free to enter (extra for domes or skywalk). They are beautifully laid out and well tended. Beautiful by day and amazing at night with light show.
I enjoyed Gardens by the bay from the meadow and it was just beautiful and relaxing. The changing colours in the dark and the faint music. Bliss
"Highly recommended as a lovely place to visit. We walked there from our hotel, along Clark Quay and enjoyed the local area."
"There is a lot to see, plenty of parking but the best is at night when they have the light shows to music and the supertrees come alive. There is a spectacular sky walk for those with head for heights, I failed!"
very well laid out. unique plant species. easy walking for those who are challenged. need taxi to get there.
The Gardens are a fantastic display of many varieties of vegetation as well as art.It was very special to visit during the Chinese New Year celebrations.
"evening show was breathtaking,find a good place to sit and watch, althogh there is lot of walk so wear comfy shoes and don't forget to click pictures."
This is a wonderful place to visit & the night light show is just amazing. The only down side is the tickets booked on line need redemption. I had read & re-read the instructions that it was at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. But it's actually at another shopping centre a taxi ride away. Turned out when we picked up the tickets on the the displays were closed that day & you could not use your ticket on another day. So went back that night for the the light show then back in the morning to everything else. Lovely
"totally amazed by the variety of trees and flowers, can't stopped doing pictures all the time, green is the dominant"
"We visited by day due to airline schedules and thoroughly enjoyed it but can only imagine just how magical it would be at night! A technological wonder, as well as staggering in the beauty of the gardens and variety and colours of the flowers,"
"You need either 2 visits here, a day and an evening or go in the afternoon and stay thru the evening. Light shows every evening are fabulous, the flower dome and cloud forest dome definately worth a visit too. Top class place to visit."
We went one evening and even though it was raining the perfectly sculptured gardens and amazing light show was an absolute joyDon't miss it
"This was really pretty good and a must see. It's one of a couple However in general Singapore itself isn't really tourist friendly.This was an excellent place but I have just come from Taipei and what an amazing experience in terms of the people. So friendly great sights that are real. Singapore is artificial, overrated and overpriced. My advice is don't do Singapore, many way better places."
"Easy to get to as we took a taxi which we though was reasonably priced.This is a huge sight that really needs a whole day and I suggest going later in the morning so you can be there when it starts to get dark as wellLots of beautiful sights to see, places to sit and places to eat. Very accessible for those less ableA little confusing when you arrive where you buy tickets for the various exhibits which for two are at the actual exhibit."
Better than we expected. Gardens by the bay is an interesting blend of nature and engineering and gives great views of the marina bay sands. It's an open space so there's a lot of room to roam free and get restbite from the busy centre of Singapore. I would suggest going at sunset for the best views
Definitely worth the visit. Go after 5pm so that you can enjoy the Garden on the by & as the sun goes down you must stay for the superTree light show. Superb!!
Take the time to visit. Give yourself a day to experience this wonderful feature.The Domes are unbelievable.
We had hop on hop off bus tickets hop off here stunning absolutely loved it great views over bay and the planting was amazing a must see
"A must when visiting Singapore!We visited both domes and took the skywalk. We were on the skywalk when the light performance took place. It was spectacular!I wish we had more time to spend at the gardens.I recommend coming around 5-6pm and spend at least 3-4 hours there, preferably more!"
A great place to visit with kids and family in the day and a significant other in the night. Best time to visit is in the evening just before sunset to enjoy the gardens in the daylight and stay till nightfall to watch the supertrees light up. Don't forget to visit the cloud gardens(entrance fee applies) and the tree top walk.
One of the most spectacular exhibits of gardens and technology that should not be missed when you visit Singapore. We visited at night this trip and it was spectactular!! Dont miss the flower dome and cloud forrest.
"a very big and beautiful garden. there are various plants here which are apparently also many in Indonesia hahah with good management, it can be an asset to climate change"
"The gardens are a beautiful green space to be explored. The flower dome and cloud forest are defo worthwhile viewing. Allow for a minimum of 3 hours. I suggest you arrive around 4-5pm, enjoy the gardens by day and once the sun sets stay for the light show and concert; something you won't forget. The skywalk and Observatory give you aerial views but you don't need to do both. (The observatory is air conditioned )"
"It was so much fun during day and night, obviously night is better because you have the show on both sides of the garden at different times. Do not miss it for the world if you're in Singapore, it's free :)!"
"Must visit both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Flowers, landscape and display at the Flower Dome changes according to festivals. Strolling at The Cloud Forest is so cooling and love the BIG waterfall. Stay till the night, enjoy the lights and show at the Supertree Grove."
Anyone remotely interested in gardens will be in their element wandering through the many different displays and marvelling at the hanging gardens throughout. Visually stunning.
A must visit for any visit to Singapore. best to visit later in the afternoon to catch the light show
"The Gardens by the Bay is just one of a kind. There's much to see- you have the option of choosing between the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. We asked the lady at the counter to choose the more popular one, in the interest of time, and she recommended the Flower Dome. It was beautiful in its arrangement, variety and presentation. We opted not to do the guided tour. It was enjoyable just the same.Also in the Gardens is the Skyway which is a walkway from one Supertree to another. Very IG worthy with its breathtaking view of the Singapore skyline. There's an entry fee of $8 per head. It was quite hot up there as it was right before lunch, so better to go up when it's cooler."
Wonderful place to visit in Singapore. Could spend hours here at the domes and gardens. A must to see
Make sure you go to the gardens by the bay and watch the super trees show. Also make sure to read the info about them they are not just pretty but also serve an environmental purpose
"It is very beautiful place! We love it! At the evening time is soo beautiful to walk there, and at the day time is less people"
"Great Attraction to visit both during the day and at night , well worth a visit .Fantastic light show at night !"
"Gardens by the Bay is the most brilliant, imaginative, entertaining, educational, sustainable in water and energy, concept for a modern garden. Made on reclaimed land on the Bay, these Gardens perfectly match the modernity, creativity and vibrancy of Singapore.They are simply unmissable!We visited 3 times. Once to walk and enjoy the free gardens. An evening visit to see the spectacular free light show(7.45 and 8.45pm nightly). And 4 hours being stunned and 'wow-ed!' In the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and Arial Walkway between the Super Trees.All visits absolutely beyond superlatives!There are numerous places for refreshments; plenty of toilets and water fountains. If you are tiring, take the $3 Shuttlebus to and from Bayfront."
"Gardens by the bay was a total amazing experience! The beautiful garden and its surrounding is well worth a visit. We went there in the afternoon, and stayed until late in the evening to se the light and music show, it was fantastic! People were laying down, which (in my opinion) is the best way to enjoy it.If you're in Singapore; don't miss the opportunity to visit this amazing place!"
Avatar-like garden. Went to flower dome and cloud forest. Nicely decorated garden and full of beautiful flowers.
"Loved the clouds, definitely exceeded our expectations. It took about a little over an hour to walk through both but could have spent more time in them. Beautiful, AC & very unique, great place to visit during the day and get out of the heat."
An amazing experience as you walk through the different stations and view the diversity of plants.Make sure you watch the evening show
"You can't be in Singapore and not visit the gardens on the bay,they are easily reached by MRT.There is well sign posted paths to direct you to different areas of the gardens,also the water fountains and Lilly pad pond are beautiful,the flower domes are worth looking at,if you only want to visit one then the cloud one is the more spectacular of the two.We were not lucky enough to see the otters that move through the park but we did see a few lizards."
"Go to this show before the Spectre light show its wonderful waiting for it to get dark ,then this display starts a great evening out watching both shows"
"Ever so proud of Singapore whenever I step into the Gardens. The epitome of technology, civilisation and man's love for nature on display. There are always happy smiling faces around, a bit like being in a sci-fi movie when you see those baobabs. Fascinating, child-like wonder naturally arises."
Is a well designed place to learn and experience about nature. Will definitely a day to spend if u are capable to walk
"Been to Singapore 3-4 times , but with so many things to do, we never ended up at gardens by the bay at night to see the evening show or feel the night atmosphereGreat entertainment, great sense of being outdoors, beautiful sound and light show, and ten minutes by subway back to the hotelNow, how cool is that."
It was a walk thru green paradise with some rare and some rather common plants. Overall experience was good.The walk thru the tropical fern laden garden was great and the way the humidity/ temperature is controlled to keep plants in perfect health was astounding.
If you are not a gardener but love beautiful things then this is a must. There are three domes to visit so give yourself time. Each dome is different but next to each other. The first we went into was all flat and if you need to chill out sit there for a while.The second is international so look for a section with plants from your country. They even have baobab tree. It is not flat but easy walking.The third is like a rainforest and you take a lift to the top then it is a gentle walk down hill all the way.Once again we took the underground which takes you quite close.
"For the past several years, we have visited the gardens at least once a quarter. It just get better every time visiting. It is well maintain and groom according to seasonal celebrations. Kids love just to run around in the neat opened spaces and visit children gardens and water walk ways. It is a must to visit with young kids."
This place is worth visit. Beautiful man made garden and marvelous architecture. The lighting show at the evening is mind blowing.
Enjoyed the lovely Gardens by the Bay. Am especially impressed with the flowers as laid out in the dome. Good change of flowers as well as driven by varying seasons through the world. Well thought out and planned.
"Must visit when in Singapore !. Beauty of the place attracted me for my second visit to the place I remain deeply impressed with the concept and the magnetic attractiveness of the place with mind boggling variety of plants and flowers. Mesmerizing beauty of the artistically sculpted shapes from logs and natural material, with attractive scenes out of story books are an attraction to kids and adults alike."
"One of the best places of interest in Singapore, for both tourists and locals. There are paid and unpaid sites. Find out more at website. I like to cycle there from East Coast Park. Relaxing and scenic. Easily accessible by public transport too."
This attraction is well worth a visit. Its not overly expensive and the return on your money provides excellent value.The gardens are amazing - the two domes and the light show at night are extremely well done and very exciting.Take the opportunity to walk the sky walk as this provides excellent views over the gardens and parts of Singapore.
"I have never seen such a beautiful man-made garden anywhere else. well conceived and marvelous architecture, located in the center of the city. dont miss the ocbc sky walk which gives a eagle's eye view of CBD."
The theme of the garden is changed throughout the year depending on the seasons of the flowers and festivals. I went in December and it was Christmas time so I get to see different varieties of poinsettias.At another garden there were many varieties of cacti.Worth spending a few hours spending there.
The most amazing place .Loved every thing that I saw. Easy to get to.by hop on hop off bus and a short walk.The gardens are full of colour and amazing eye catching objects.Plenty of places to eat and just sit and enjoy the atmosphere
"It is beautiful at night, amazing view with amazing lights. Doesn't necessary to be a couple-to-go, I went with friends and the experience was phenomenal."
"When in Singapore this is the place you must visit. We we unlucky to visit on an afternoon when the skies opened so we did not stay for the light show which was disappointing. However, the visit to the two domed features was well worth the trip. They are truly amazing."
Visited late afternoon and evening in late December. Cooler temps in the evening meant lots of other tourists. We did not visit the conservatories but did do the suspended walkway between the super trees for a reasonable cost. Buy those tickets closer to the attraction and not the entrance. Better signage could have prevented us standing in line. You buy your ticket and they inform when you come back to the attraction. During our visit the trees lit up with Christmas music which is a bit odd for North Americans who are used to Christmas ending on Christmas Day. The eggs in the waterway lit up with changing colors to soothing music at night. Whole area is easy to get to by MRT. Really glad we visited.
This is probably the best place to go in Singapore and you'll probably need over half a day to explore this because it is pretty big. Get off at Bayfront MRT and follow signs to this place. Get the tickets you want - I took the bundle ticket which includes 2 conservatories (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) plus Floral Fantasy and Shuttle Service - they were amazing especially the Cloud Forest with the impressive waterfall and the Flower Dome. Go to Supertree Grove but you will need an extra ticket of 8 dollars to do the OCBC Skyway which you will get impressive views but it is better to do this in the evening before sunset
Went here at night to see the light show. Really well laid out gardens. Worth going an hour or so before sunset to see in daylight. However the light show is fantastic
"This place is a sure shot winner in the list of attractions in Singapore. Flower dome and the cloud forest which forms the epicentre of this majestic attraction is breathtaking. The place is huge so suggest, you guys reserve plenty of time if you wish to explore it at a normal pace. The architectural as well as the floral display truly compliment each other. Once out of the enclosed domes you can visit the different gardens in the vicinity. Best to be explored via shuttle service which costs 8 SGD per person. And then evening hours are best spent near the super grove tree. You can also take the skywalk and the climax is the light and sound show at the super grove tree which takes place at 7:45 pm and 8:45 pm everyday. We were unfortunate to have missed the skywalk experience because of the heavy rains. To summarise a full day is required to visit the place."
A lovely walk around the gardens. easily reached from Bayfront mtr station. Pay for gardens within the domes and treetop walk. Competing with the Botanical Gardens.
"We had a great day walking the gardens and finished off going up on to the sky deck if you want to sit and have something to eat I would suggest you book a meal on the deck but we had a Macdonald in the gardens filled a gap, the flowers and lake and the metal flower structures were amazing they are building a park for kids which looked like it will be open soon"
Fantastic large array of garden displays by the waterfront. There are two domes and then many ground level walks plus a skywalk at 25 metres. The park is very efficient with courteous staff and plenty of good toilet facilities and many eating establishments. The dim sum at theMajestic Bay Seafood restaurant is excellent with great service.
We live close to the Eden Project in Cornwall which now pales in comparison to the Gardens by the Bay. This place is incredible and was loved by our 3 year old too.
Place was good and interesting. Definitely should go with our loved ones to enjoy the scenary and take lots of pictures.
Great place. Everything is amazing from the indoor gardens to the show of the trees to the location. Don't think of missing it
Absolutely a must when you visit Singapore. Had a wonderful day there. The displays were brilliant and even with young children there was plenty to see and do.
Gorgeous gardens and landscape architecture. A true experience. We could have spent the whole day and never gotten bored!
"This is an amazing place to visit, especially when there are concerts. Stay after dark and enjoy the shows."
Great planning of the gardens. Extremly beautiful. It is a must to do when visiting Singapore.Impressive construction.
"Beautiful structures and gardens, and so easy to get around. Night time is worth a second visit to see the 'trees' lit and listen to the music."
"The fantastic lighting display to music last 15 minutes twice nightly, their must have been a thousand people watching the show, hundreds of them lying on the ground looking upwards to get the best views.It's a must to see when staying in Singapore, when leaving make sure you have pre booked a taxis otherwise the queues will take ages to get through."
"We had such a lovely day visiting Gardens by the Bay. The cloud forest and flower dome were amazing and the light show in the evening is unmissable. There is a lot of walking involved if all parts of the garden are to be seen, but it's worth the effort. I'd recommend going early afternoon to see everything, finishing with the light show.We even saw 10 otters playing in the lakes."
"This amazing site surpassed all expectations. The scale, the colour, variety and beauty were overwhelming. The light show was brilliant - both from the Skyway and from the ground. No one should miss this."
"Both the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are extremely well done, but the shining star is the Cloud Forest. You really are transported to another world - it's just amazing. Would suggest doing the Flower Dome first, or else you may feel a bit of a let down. There are also other nice gardens as well as the giant trees. A great way to spend a few hours in lovely surroundings."
"This place is really something else. The cloud dome is a must visit in Singapore, can't find anything like it anywhere else. Great for families, couples, solo, anyone really."
Beautiful gardens to explore on multiple levels. A refreshing and tranquil atmosphere to enjoy regardless of your age. A must see spectacle whilst in Singapore.
"A vision by National Parks Board of Singapore to create a city in a garden, and in June 2012 it officially opened. The Gardens by the Bay is magnificent and I had dedicated a full day to explore it. There is quite a bit to do here, from The Cloud Forest and The Flower Dome to the Supertree Grove to the Eggs on Dragonfly Lake, plan to spend a day here to get the most out of this magnificent attraction."
"This is truly a superb, world class garden in the world. The gardens comprise of Cloud Forest, Flower Garden and Supertree Grove. In a dense city like Singapore, these gardens are the sight relief of what make Singapore as the garden city."
"The free light show in the evening is great, set to music the effect is brilliant.During the day the ticketing is a little confusing. Buy a ticket for this or this or both but not the other thing???We went in the flower garden (I think it's called) with the waterfall and it was a great way to spend a couple of hours. Lots to see."
A very nice urban forest. Had a heard a lot about the place so it was good to finally attend. Temperature controlled and you get to witness a variety of flora from around the world.
"It's always beautiful to be surrounded by nature, and the water features, clear sky and wide paths always make for a lovely stroll. However, just remember to bring a brolly with you to shield from Singapore's weather: it's either fiercely sunny, or pouring with rain. Either way, that umbrella will come in handy."
"CLoud forest waterfall was majestic and captivating. You can photo the view from 6th floor,3rd or ground floor, at different angle, the view is still beautiful. Flower dome with sakura cherry blossom is mind blowing, hello kitty figurines everywhere would make you want to snap your mobile camera non stop, depleting your phone memory rapidly but still worth it. Warning : bring along a spare camera incase it happens. All these was really a strong contrast to the hot weather outside, its like flower bubble inside, and sun tanning on the Australia beach in sunmer."
"I went on a Sun night. The area with many domes were pretty empty at night, and the skytree was closed before we reached (about 8+ 9pm). Some structures were also under construction, so it didn't look that impressive in its entirety.Although there's really nothing much to do or see there, it's a place to go to at night if you like some peace and quiet amidst all the chaos the world has to offer right now."
One of the best places in SG to spend a beautiful evening with both friends and family. Light show is amazing.Walk of lights was an excellent addition to December festive season.
"Wanted to do a last min trip to the garden but realised that we were not the only ones. We only managed to visit cloud forest, even though we had tickets to both cloud forest and flower dome (couldn't get visit slot due to difficulties in booking). I was frustrated by the fact that my booking couldn't get through as I was using iPhone safari (note to use google chrome). Bearing these, we really enjoyed cloud forest."
"Beautiful nice view, but the Skywalk and cloud forest walk abit scary at night for those fearful of heights... Daytime visits seemed OK, as everything is bright and visible but photo are nicer at night time haha"
"I understand that due to covid-19 and safety measures, attractions has made it mandatory for tourists to book their time slot before visiting the attraction. But this goes without saying that this was a complete hassle when you have to (1) Check in Safe Entry, (2) Book time slot, (3) Scan your tickets. Yea you might think this is straight forward but it isn't because if you are purchasing your tickets from another booking platform (eg: Klook), and say you purchased 3 tickets for 3 adults, each adult still has to book their own time slot - not just the 1 adult that bought the 3 tickets. So it's really maddening and time consuming. I wonder how the more senior visitors are going to figure this - more so - how the locals using their Singapore Rediscover vouchers are going to redeem after purchasing the tickets from the booking platforms. Other than the administrative stuff, both conservatories were pretty nice!"
These huge gardens are full of tropical plants. I would especially recommend the cloud forest biosphere which is amazing. There are lots of eating options in a food court so this makes a good day out destination.
"First time visiting the Flower Dome n Cloud Forest, really enjoyed walking around n enjoying the plants and flowers. The flowers were really beautiful in Flower Dome. Cloud forest was misty and cooling to walk through. Will visit again for sure."
"very nice place to walk in the greenhouse. reconstitution of various landscapes, Holland, Mediterranean, American desert, .... Very large varieties of flowers and flora. Also located in a very lively garden with street shows, very family-friendly"
"One of the most spectacular experiences in the city, this is a place that you should definitely include your tour. Very modern, very artificial, yet very beautiful."
"Good trail in the cooling cloud forest .not many people. Was expecting some seasonal unique plants in dome this time ,but not to expectations. Designing were too minimal."
"Comfortable air-conditioned. Do not have to worry about the weather. Very pretty blooming flowers. I have visited the place more than 4 times this year, the exhibits always changes, so you will not feel bored."
"You need to book your 1 hour slot before entering the Cloud Forest or Flower Dome. You can still book online on the spot if you haven't done so before making your way to the place.Without the hordes of tourists, the place is peaceful and worth a visit as there are no more people photo bombing your photos.The flower displays are simple and not thematic like the previous ones focusing on roses, tulips, cherry blossoms etc. Nevertheless, the peaceful atmosphere allows a more relaxed appreciation of the plants on display than before Covid19 times."
Quite a nice tourist attraction. Beautiful flowers... A nice place to relax and walk... tickets are not cheap tho. Worth visiting at least once in a lifetime.
When there for Sakura session. Is nice but hope to see more type of sakura trees. Please go early to avoided crowded
"Thanks to Covid-19, as it forced us to travel inland, hence, we discovered this beautiful garden in our homeland"
Beautiful park with the large glass houses being the highlight of course. The tropical rainforest is spectacular. You need to use a bus or taxi to get there. The nearest MRT station is fine for younger visitors but a fair hike if you are not used to walking distances.
The gardens by the bay has loads of cool and rare flowers there's to many to count. I recommend going there again
September is the time which Singapore celebrate the Mid Autumn Moon Cake Festival even though Singapore does not have 4 seasons.
"For special exhibit of flowers & the tall man-made fountain- best to pay to get into the Dome or get up to the Supertrees...(it has a diff feels at diff time)else there are free viewing of sculptures, plants and trees , ponds and fountains in the open-air garden (Free for all) , enough for u to spend an hour on photo-taking!!! the park is ez to maneuver hence do NOT worry u will get lost (there are adequate signs around to ensure u get to public transport like Bayfront)(For those who are into succulents and Carnivorous plants u have to get into the dome to view them!)However , for this mid-autumn Lantern festival (their yearly event) , their exhibit displayed is on such a small scale ,hence a real big disappointment!!!!I will rate it lowly for this aspectIf u are into the night view of this place, it is best u get to it before dark to view its day scene & insects creeping/climbing on plants and it will start to light up at about 7pm....You will get to see the lit up Marina Bay Sands and the nite scene of Sg Flyer too"
"Really enjoyed our visit, be prepared for a lot of walking. The flower collection is excellent and the indoor water fall if a great experience"
"There are lots of parks in Singapore, but in my opinion the most beautiful and also the biggest is Garden by the Bay, part of the Marina. Being one of the popular tourist attractions in Singapore, I visited this place in December 2019. With all its uniqueness, going to Singapore would be incomplete without visiting Merlion Park and Garden By The Bay. If you visit this place during the day, you will see various plants and flowers. A different view will be seen if you visit it in the afternoon or evening, because this place will turn into a garden decorated with very beautiful lights"
We have an annual pass but of course the kids water park was the main attraction for our 4 year old.
"have been there during last Christmas with friends, the decorations are amazing and pretty in evening. just too crowded due to the holiday, but it is okay as it is the holiday aotomasphere. Will go again this year if we have chance."
"Very green, flowery, pleasant ambiance. Make sure to leave at least half hour before closing, otherwise it's next to impossible to get a cab."
Cloud Forest is always my favourite esp the man-made water fall. The theme changes every quarter. This winterland theme one at Flower Dome is not impressive. The team behind it needs to step up.
"Perfect family freindly place. Highly recommend ! Perfect for three to ten year olds, but a great attraction for all ages."
"We visited Gardens by the Bay, and the Cloud Forest. It was a very nice experience, unfortunately we just missed a guided tour in English but made our way around with no problem. Interesting plants, flowers and shrubs with some beautiful art work - birds etc., made from what looked like drift wood. I would definitely recommend a visit."
"If you love Gardens and Roses perfect place to go, not recommended to go with kids or old people.... need to walk a lot and keep your memory empty"
"I've been a regular visitor here over the years, both to the domes and the gardens proper (on both sides of the bay). The outer gardens can get very hot - important to try and visit early in the day or later in the afternoon. A great selection of plants to see and well maintained. Whilst certain parts can feel a bit boring after a while (such as the Cloud Dome), the gardens overall are very large and there's always plenty of interest."
It's a large garden which offers varieties of flowers and plants. The arrangements styles are attractive and the room design is quite unique. For the plants or flowers lovers this is the place they could enjoy. Afternoon to evening time are more crowded because the lights at nights it looks the Garden more attractive and best shots for souvenir photos.
"This was one of the places I had to vist and we went twice. There can be quite a lot of walking and, if newly arrived, the humidity can be energy-sapping. We were impressed by the ingenious designs and presenation of different styles of planting. There are areas still under development. Staff were very helpful and there were places for food. It was free to wander around with tickets required for the special features. When we were there we didn't encounter queues. On a stopover visit it's well worth spending half a day here and we would happily return."
"You can tell as soon as you arrive at Gardens By The Bay how much work goes in to this spectacular place. The plant life is abundant and stunning, the colours are so vivid that pictures just can't do it justice!There is a lot to see at Gardens by the Bay so make sure you have at least an entire day set aside to be there.Even when it gets busy you don't really notice as the garden is so vast you still feel as though you're in your own little bit of paradise.The ground is quite flat and it's easy to push a wheelchair or trolley around with minimal effort."
"Worth a visit when you are in SG!A well organized place, my parents love it (although they hate the long walks)!"
"It is a huge maze-like forest garden with a lot of amazing features like understanding the nature knowledge, history but artsy looks to it.You can also enjoy the night light of the forest."
Everything was nice but thing seemed a little out of place to our eyes. Maybe it was a plant changeover time?
The garden is very big and you can walk around and reach Marina Bay from here. The sceneries was GREAT and my family and I definitely had a great bonding time together here!
"We should have looked more into how much there was to do for free before going into the bigger portions of the gardens! It was really cool to see as much as we did with as little time as we had, as well as the extra burden of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, due to the pandemic, there was literally no line to get into the SuperTree and both Conservatories. The conservatories were very pretty to walk through. We then went to the Super Tree (which was less than we thought because there is a walkway as well, that is not the ""Super Tree"") and watched the sunset. The experience was perfect for what we had time for, however my wife and I both agreed that it would have been better to allot more time to walk through the gardens being there is so much more to see than the two conservatories and the super tree. We looked on trip-advisor and other reviews of the gardens and were told that 4 hours would be enough time to walk through the entirety of the park. IT IS NOT! There is so much more to see and walk through, and we were there beyond the closing of the park.Finding the openings to the Conservatories and Super Tree from Marina bay sands was a pain! We walked for probably around 30 minutes before we were able to find an entrance to the park (In this area, there is no crosswalks, and all intersections for walking transit go underground or above the road), we followed the signs, and tried multiple different ways, and even talked to information desks and got no help to get there.Long story short, if you're trying to schedule out times, only go to the paid portions and take the loss of the rest of the park, and get a ride so you're not looking more for crosswalks than plants and sights."
"Don't expect an overwhelming sensory experience, but you will enjoy coming here if you like a gentle entertainment outing. The one thing I did enjoy greatly was the succulents and cactus displays - there were some great specimens on display."
"Floral fantasy is really beautiful, but little bit short to see as much paid.Cloud forest have much to see, but need more kinds of flowers."
"Yes, go! Best to do it in the very late afternoon, I believe. That way, it's just bright enough to give drama and depth to the cactus arrangements. I wish the pathways were less park-like but that'd make it very difficult for those with physical disabilities and the elderly to walk on. The cherry blossoms, of course, are not there indefinitely so go for the cactus."
Fantastic place which definitely worth a visit both during the day or at night! Very well maintained of the garden and the pictures snapped over here are Gorgeous!
A real exibition of flowers and pplants from over the world. Especially the tulips like in Holland are fantastic.
Very nice and it is always some new exhibitions to see.If you are in Singapore this a very good place to visit.
This garden is very nice. it is done up very nicely and worth to visit if you do come to Singapore .
"Didn't have long as on a cruise and here for only a day, got the mrt from cruise terminal but had to change platforms as not able to do it direct. Lovely gardens, peaceful even though busy, had a good walk around and through different areas which was free to do, but you had to pay to go inside all areas which we didn't have time, we also thought we would of liked to visit in the evening as maybe it would of looked better lit up at night as pictures show on advertisements."
"The flowers were blooming all nicely! Although it was still crowded, it's still possible take pictures of the cherry blossoms."
"I visited Gardens By The Bay straight off the plane having flown from London, so I only visited the the walkway in the trees and not the greenhouses, gives me an excuse to go back to Singapore some day!The attraction is very unique and like nothing I have visited before. I really enjoyed the walk through through trees and gardens and the walkway offers you spectacular view of the bay and the Marina Bay Sands.The gardens offers an amazing lights show accompanied by music in the evening, its like watching light fireworks. I was lucky enough to be staying at the Marina Bay Sands with a room over looking the gardens so I watched the light show from my balcony. Absolutely breathtaking.Well worth a visit if you are in Singapore"
"The gardens by the bay is an amazing facility. We enjoyed our hours touring the indoor gardens. From arid to rain forest, there's lots to see/experience.We will be back to tour the out door areas!"
"I found this place amazing, as did my children. The cloud dome was spectacular. I wasn't as fussed on the flower dome. Unless you like cacti and succulents it has much of what backyard gardens or parks have. We didn't see the flower fantasy dome which I think may have been a better choice then the flower dome, but when we went to buy the ticket 'bundle' described on their website they said the bundle was sold out. How can a ticket bundle sell out? Especially at 9.30 in the morning! But other than that I really loved the outdoor gardens and the cloud dome.TAKE A JUMPER (the flower dome especially is freezing), and don't forget towels and a change of clothes for the kids as there is a wet play area. We used the towels around our shoulders in the cold domes"
"Was expecting this to be the highlight of our trip, but we came home feeling a little deflated. First stop was the floral fantasy, which is very colourful and enjoyable and finished off by a nice 3D cinema experience. Next came the flower dome, which we found a real let down. A massive conservatory with themed areas of different parts of the world, this consisted of mainly trees and cacti. There are some clever exhibits scattered around within the gardens but apart from that it was not too interesting. If we were to return, I would not want to revisit.The cloud forest conservatory is far better and very impressive, having the showpiece waterfall and an orchid section which is a photographers dream. An elevated tree top walkway is also very good, well worth the money and probably the highlight of the gardens. Next came Suppertree Grove, which again was just ok. Once you have seen one, then the experience is fulfilled, the others seem insignificant. The observatory visit was part of our admission ticket and once at the top you have a really good view of the gardens. We made the mistake of paying extra for the skywalk, this really isn't necessary if you are doing the observatory. Would not recommend paying extra for it. There are food outlets in the Gardens but we didn't feel the need for food as we were only there for a couple of hours after having breakfast in our hotel. Cannot comment on the nightime experience as we didn't go back in the evening."
"Having watched the impressive light show the night before, my wife and I visited the Gardens by the Bay the following morning as we were keen to see both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest.Unfortunately, when we arrived there was a notice to say that the Cloud Forest was closed for the day.It appears that it is a regular occurrence for one or other of the domes to be closed for maintenance, and unfortunately we were only in Singapore for a short period so were unable to re-visit. My advice is to check before you set out."
"Arrived around 7 in the evening (local time) and the queue was pretty long, since it was on the weekend. The view was magnificent and not too busy with tourist. Pretty enjoyable visit."
"It's nice to see it by day to see the structure and how it's assembled.If you want to see the full beauty of it, see it at night. It's much cooler and more rewarding to see it lighted up.It's still nice to walk and meander around the area during the day and you must go up to the cloud by the forest nearby if you are already here anyways. The cloud forest was mostly why I made the jaunt to the gardens.It is cool to see the Gardens By The Bay floral homage up close too. It's a nice stepping stone to see other great things."
"I really enjoyed the gardens, they're very beautiful! The river and lights on the river were also very nice. The entire place is extremely tranquil so I recommend stopping by at least once if you're in the area. After I'd seen the light show on the marina bay, I was disappointed by the light show at the gardens. Overall though, it's worth the trip if you're in the area."
"In February we visited Singapore for the first time. We spend most of our first day there and returned on a different evening to see the light and music show. On our first visit we used the transit system to get to Bayfront station on both the DT and CE lines. There is quite a long subway from the station that bring you out just outside the gardens. During our stay we walked around some of the gardens, did the Skyway, had lunch, visited the Flower dome and timed our visit to the Cloud Forest to be there when the mist was turned on. The whole site was spotlessly clean and the staff friendly and helpful. Having walked for most of our 5 hour visit we decided to return on a different evening to see the light show. We returned on a Friday evening to see the light and music show. We enjoyed it so much that we had a quick drink and stayed for the second show. Leaving the gardens after dark the walk back to the transit station was great with fabulous views of the illuminated displays in and around the gardens."
"Spent the best part of a day in the gardens. Purchased entry to both domes at entry, and after a leisurely walk through the Malaysian, Chinese and Indian gardens went to the Cloud dome.But first was the obligatory coffee.Walking through the entry doors to The Cloud dome has the WOW factor. This is by far the most impressive part of the gardens and should not be missed. You will need a few hours in here to do it justice and you will remember your visit.We were lucky in that visitor numbers were well down due to Coronavirus so we had plenty of space which probably at other times could have distracted from this impressive exhibit.The Flower dome in comparison is lower key. At our visit there was a new exhibit of Japanese Gardens, which although interesting were more focused for other visitors. Orchids were fantastic though.Returned in the evening for the Light Show which was OK but not fantastic. Worth a visit though as it's free and only takes 15 minutes.All on all a great day out and well worth experiencing Singapore's advance into 21 century."
"Flower Dome has nice decorative flower exhibitions every now and then. Provides good scenery backdrop for great photoshoots. Cloud Forest waterfall is majestic for indoors.During Christmas season yearly, there is Christmas Wonderland themed park in Gardens by the Bay, with magnificent and exquisite luminarie lights built all around. Christmas carolling, fun rides, games, and artificial snowfall are also highlights of the event. Truly exhilarating experience with the Christmas event."
"it was rare for us to get a table without advance reservation, and we were happy to sit in the Pollen Cafe for our afternoon tea and enjoying the bright sun and ambient."
Sakura matsuri @ Gardens by the Bay. Had a lovely family bonding time there. Gardens by the Bay organised this event very well and we felt as if we were transported to Japan when we visited the place. The flowers were beautiful and the deco was immaculate. It attracted many locals and foreigners to the event. Visit was in April 2018. Didnt get to visit in 2019.
Worth a visit at night to see the light show. One of the popular things to do in Singapore so can get busy
"Feel excited to see the super trees..And it was so beautiful at night, spectra light and the opening song it present some asian , and it was amazing..Then luckily when i visited it there was a short folk theater. Their acting is so genuine.. applause for allHow a great idea to have it in Singapore"
"There is a lot happening in the gardens so it is well worth checking out. The light show in the artificial trees at night was lovely, although very popular and packed with tourists. Do have a wander around during the day as well to see all the other aspects of the gardens, which they have spent so much time putting together."
"Lovely place to visit even if you do not visit the two domes. Nice area to walk around. But one ought to visit the Cloud and flower domes, really worth a visit. Trees and plants very cleverly laid out."
We loved the gardens . The super trees are not as big as they seem online but still very impressive. To be honest if you're a garden enthusiast the Botanical Gardens are a better shout in Singapore. The music lights show however is fantastic and you can within the outdoor gardens for free which was great. Yoi can simply sot on the grass look up and enjoy it. One of our highlights for sure. A beautiful musical raphsody. You have to check it out!
"This wasn't really my sort of thing but it's hard not to appreciate the time,money and effort that has gone in to creating this attraction,we spent a good few hours of a Sunday morning just having a pleasant wander around here and as the entrance is free makes it even more enjoyable.We did pay for the Skywalk to get a better look at the surrounds and also enjoyed the wee cafe,full marks Singapore !!."
"Very pleasant morning in these beautiful gardens, we did the skywalk, you get a great view of the expansive park.There's a great feature if you're travelling with children, a water park for them to enjoy.All in in worth a visit."
"Visited the gardens by the bay during Chinese New Year commencing from the Flower Dome to the Cloud Forest and OCBC skywalk.We pre purchased our tickets online via Klook which was a bit cheaper for a family of five.When you have a little toddler at two she got free entrance and priority because you have a stroller to access the entry points.So we came from Marina Bay Sands mall and walked through the dragonfly bridge and you get a glimpse of the pretty man made lake with light up floral pieces on the water. Past the Chinese gardens which had plenty of grass areas to sit down and enjoy the view.Walked towards the super tree grove whereby they had the toilets, ticket purchase stands and souvenir stores.There we walked towards the flower dome where the fun begins it starts with a colourful lit up walls of flowers And leads up to the air conditioned massive automated doors inside the dome. On your right is an abundance of succulents all from around the world along with man made wooden sculptures which really complimented the settings. As you follow the path, we went back to the middle where it had the zodiac setup with all the animals again it was so colourful and enjoyable to see fresh plants.Afterwards went to stop by one of a few souvenir shops where we bought a fridge magnet (the other stores were much the same but not all had the same stock so still check the shops if you're after something in particular).To the cloud forest, now it was super cold upon entry and coming from the humidity of Singapore outside, bring a cardigan for the kids too. The waterfall was beautiful and sound was relaxing. Be careful when taking pictures as you will get wet and wear good shoes as it was slippery. Despite them having safety sign warnings , be cautious and walk safely. Heading towards the top of the waterfall was a long snake line so after reaching the top we walked it. Mind you if you're scared of heights might not be idealBut as long as you stay in the middle of the walk way you'll be ok. Really nice to experience the rain forest feeling , would've enjoyed it more if it wasn't crowded. Afterwards we walked to the OCBC skywalk however missed the time slot. So when buying tickets online make sure you go to the main admission area to get time slot tickets to be able to access the OCBC skywalk. Whilst we missed out as this wasn't disclosed when we bought it online and picking up ticket we stayed downstairs for the lights show. Choose a place to seat and watch the 10-15min show. Watch the theatrical light show which was ended the night on a high . Wonderful experience overall and will visit it again when it's not crowded."
It is a great experience and certainly a very essential site to visit while in Singapore. We have visited before but the changing displays make it worth a repeat visit
"The gardens offer a chance to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city for a while, although they do have a designer shopping mall attached! They have been beautifully designed and offer excellent opportunities for photos."
"Gardens by the bay, Flower dome and Cloud forrest, well worth a visit,great photo opportunities and a fun morning/afternoon out when it's raining."
"I am not big on gardens, but this was impressive. It was nice walking around the gardens. This is definitely worth visiting"
well worth the money and time. I was thrilled with the different plants and it was a lovely experience.
"One of our stops on the bus tour, this was a great walk-around. No charge to get in and elevator to take you down the hill from the observation entrance."
"It's truly a wow experience to see gardens by the bay. Magnificent, magical and marvelous. Could be physically tiring to explore it completely but definitely worth it."
"Lovely area to visit, huge gardens & the complex is amazing you can spend alot of time here, Gardens in the sky is extra & its free to walk around the outside garden, highly recommend this area"
I was in Singapore and went here. It was not cheap but it was fun. There are different parts to walk around. Lots of plants that I've never seen before. I enjoyed it.
We would have given 4 and 1/2 if we could. We visited the park during the day and at night (The supertrees at night were magical). We also visited the 2 domes (the Cloud forest and the flower dome) We started by the cloud forest which we enjoyed very much. We then went to the flower dome which we found disappointing. There was not enough flowers to have real visual impact. I would definitely recommend skipping the flower dome especially as the entrance fee was quite steep.Save money and walk around the park instead
"I definitely recommend taking a walk through the Gardens by the Bay. The gardens are free to roam and very beautiful and fascinating in design. You can easily spend some hours here and just walk and enjoy the scenic views.The only downside I see is the indoor gardens and tree-top walk charges a rather high fee for entry. These exhibits are indeed something else, but paying 20+ Singapore dollars per event is a bit much in my opinion. I decided to do a few of them anyway since I was there and I do not regret it.Consider visiting in the night time as the lighting of the gardens is supposed to be spectacular!!"
"Worth the long walk from Bayfront Mrt. Nice and cool place to burn one's calories. Worth visiting is The Flower Dome where different theme in every season to keep the place refreshed and attract repeating visitors. For The Cloud Forest, there is only one way to enter by taking the designated lifts and queues are well organized and speedy. You can get a good and beautiful view of the surrounding outside this forest and examine structure of the building. Can spend three quarter of the day here and the surroundings. Reentry of the domes is possible."
"Best seen at night, very beautiful gardens with plenty to see. There are lots to do and see and it caters for all ages. Worth a visit."
"What a great place to walk around and see a beautiful garden. Entry into the actual garden is free the only cost that exists is the entry into the cloud forest, flower dome and sky way walk. The cloud forest and flower dome are too separate but nearby attractions that I really enjoyed and the skyway is a elevated pathway linking two of the 'trees' together which gives you a view of the city region. I thought it was well worth it but it's not a place I'd go again and again."
"Really good afternoon spent at Gardens by the way. Would recommend the combined cloud/flower zones with dragonfly iMax experience, good fun. Also includes a shuttle service between domes, which was needed as very hot!"
Enjoyed an evening here after visiting the cloud forest and flower dome. Surreal and huge tree-like structures when lit up in different colours.
Nothing more can be said about this amazing place and light show.We loved the different gardens surrounding the park and the satay by the Bay eating area.If I had anything to complain about it'd be the heat. Wow.Go early or around 6pm
"We visited this man made nature park one Friday evening last December. We took the MRT train and got off at the Bayfront station and followed the crowd.We paid the entrance fee of 10 SGD ($7.50) pp to enter. (We thought it was free!) Christmas theme was everywhere, including carolers singing on the stage. We walked some distance to see the giant artificial trees. Before reaching there, we saw a lot of giant white eggs on the water.The Supertrees were magnificent! The trunks of the trees have live plants and ferns. Connecting between the Supertrees are skywalks. You have to pay a fee if you want to walk up there.The first show start at 7:45 PM. The second show starts one hour later. Not all the Suptertrees light up. We were glad we found a spot to sit because as we got closer to the show time, it got really, REALLY, crowded! People were pushing and shoving trying to take photos. The light show lasted around 15 minutes.Trying to leave after the show was another problem. All the people were exiting at the same time and it was simply a sea of humanity! Next time we visit Singapore, we will come here during the daytime and on a weekday, certainly not on Friday night! Maybe then we can walk the skywalk and see more of what the Gardens by the Bay have to offer"
The gardens were absolutely beautiful what I missed was the lack of smell. The cloud forest is really worth going to see
"Gardens by the Bay out door part is free and great to enjoy in late evening if it's not raining, not too long before the light turned on. because view changed after the light turned on. so you can enjoy both before and after.If it's Raining it's better to visit the indoor part (flower dome and cloud forest) but you have to buy tickets to enter.If you come early, better to visit the indor part first than the oud door part."
Best place to be when weather is hot and humid. Surrounded by flowers your mood is brightened up for the rest of the day in this cool environment. Good for selfie too.
a place to see beautiful seasonal flowers. Feel refreshing and energizing. There is indoor & outdoor scenery viewing
The 2 indoor domes are a must-visit and much more comfortable than being outdoors during the day. But come early and on weekdays to avoid the crowds
"Loved this, weather was perfect for touring beautiful plantings, so much imagination, loved the beautiful waterfall"
"Anyone visiting Singapore should take a trip here. If you are less interested in going inside the domes (which can be pricey) you can just take a walk around the park for free, which is equally as nice. It gets warm so bring water. A must visit when you are in Singapore."
Hop off the metro at Bayfront. This attraction is very beautiful and has something for all ages. Parts of the Gardens are subject to entrance fees. There are lots of pathways to explore and an excellent food court and gift shop. Leave via the shopping mall and you find a fabulous view of the whole of downtown Singapore
"We visited this park during the day, and enjoyed the Cloud Zone, but not so much the Flower Dome.We also visited in the evening for the daily free sound and light show.It only lasts around 15 minutes, but is worth a visitEasy to find somewhere to get a good view, access was easy, and got a taxi straight away afterwards."
Welcome to an impressive and very informative exhibition about plants and flowers. They are presented in different regions and locations of our planet. Great for small and tall.
"It's lovely place to hang out in the evenings over a couple of drinks with friends, shopping was very minimal"
Had a wonderful time at the Gardens by the Bay. Plenty to see and do. Recommend to do the flower dome and then the cloud dome. Light show is fantastic.
Enjoyed our visit to the gardens. Well looked after and interesting. They are big so give yourself at least half a day.
Overall an amazing experience. Booked through Klook so it was easy and quick. Cloud forrest and flower dome was amazing.Ticketing could do with an improvement in customer service. Remember this some of us tourists just arrived on a transit and could do with help with directions and we are not trying to waste your time or deal with your a bad attitude. Didn't bother with the skyway in the end thanks to that.
the evening light show is a must see . Tends to get crowded pretty quick. Easily accessible and great for evening stroll.
You can visit this place anytime but remember to wear shoes as you have to walk alot. Place to see in Singapore
"Every year this is the place of interest we would visit during Chinese New Year. Nice place for photo taking enclosed in an Aircon cooling area surrounded by beautifully decorated flowers & plants. Only side back this year, the place is 'tinted' by coronavirus outbreak. It is a popular place of visit for tourists especially from mainland China."
These are nice gardens to walk around to see the great architecture and plants as well as the art installations - there are other indoor gardens that can be viewed but are quite costly though
Thoroughly enjoyed the gardens and domes. The cloud forest conservatory was different and would recommend a visit. The super trees were different!
Do visit these place. Its a beautiful garden with so many mesmerizing details.loved all the 3 place in these attraction.
There's a lot to see in the Gardens by the Bay! Well worth a visit as is the shopping mall that is kind of the entrance to it. A really clever creation - and there's a stunning light show at night.
Plan on spending the whole day or 2 . We only had a few hours one evening and we did not see even a small portion of it.Would definitely spend more time there.
What a fabulous place gardens by the bay is.It's certainly a testament to the ecological thinking of the Singaporean government.You could easily spend several hours walking around all the different exhibits within the gardensIt's also worth going during both the day and night hours to be able to get the full effect
We loved the park overall. I thought the Cloud Forest was awesome. Great site for kids. The Flower Dome was interesting but less remarkable. We stayed for the light show in the trees. Interesting but cheesy. As far as light shows--go see Marina Bay Sands
Hopped off the open top bus and spent a couple of hours here. We paid to go up to the Skyway and enjoyed great views. Note the gardens are free but each of the attractions within have an entry fee.
This is a must do. You will spend at 2-3 hours here looking at all the gorgeous flowers. Lots of steps and walking. I had my older mom so be careful with the floors. A must see!
"Wonderful selection of plants. Love the cool temperature. It's very calming as we walked through the different sections, appreciating the different fragrances emitted by the flowers."
"I am not a plant person and I love Gardens by the Bay. First time visit even though I'm from Singapore... I went during the Christmas period so there were a lot more displays to see.Stayed for over 3 hours exploring all the different exhibits including the Flower Dome etc. Went back in the evening on another day to see the Christmas Wonderland and the light show.A good tip! If you're short on time and want to make your money's worth, go in the late afternoon...! That way you get to explore the place in the day, have dinner and continue exploring at night all for 1 single price!!! Most exhibits allows for re-entry, except for the Skypark.So go to that place last, just before sunset to take photos of the city and stay there for a little longer to have a bird's eye view of the city lights and the light show on the Super Trees!"
Definitely a place worth going and quite an experience in the 2 domes. Not sure If they're worth the cost though.I recommend arriving in the afternoon so you can see the lights when it gets dark.
To visit the gardens is free and there is plenty to see. I would however recommend paying to enter the 2 domes as they are incredible. Not so the observatory as all you get is a good view. We went during the day but I would imaging it is different again during the night when everything is lit up but unfortunately we weren't able to do this.
"We visited on Christmas and its very crowded than normal days, since its vacation time. For each attraction, we have waited around half an hour to 45 mins for the entry. If you are visiting by the vacation time (dec end to jan start) , please be prepared."
"Nice clean and relaxing , had coffee and a snack, nice walk, fantastic view and it was well put together, highly recommended"
It was a closed area which has air-cond inside. They will change the arrangement inside from time to time. There is some locker (chargeable) located outside before entrance for tourist to place their luggage.
"At first sight this attraction might seem competitively priced, however, many of the area carry additional charge. The nighttime light presentation lasts less than 15 minutes and is quite repetitious, but the music good."
One of the places worth visiting while in Singapore. An incredible example of design. The gardens are beautiful. Definitely spend the whole day there. Loved the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome. So many different species of flowers and plants from around the world. Recommended.
"Less than half of the electric trees were working when we were there, but luckily we were positioned on the side where they were on. It lasts about 10-15 minutes, and it's fun. We did not climb the pathway to the the top, although my husband did that during the day."
A spectacular garden worth while a visit. A cross over hard to describe. You can just have a short stroll to get an idea or hours to really explor. Will go back night time to see the illumination
"Gardens by the Bay is an absolute must while you're in Singapore. It's free to just wander around but if you want to go inside the domes there is a small ticket fee. We went in the Cloud garden but not the Flower dome. Satay by the bay is just a short walk and the street food there is varied and yummy.The Cloud garden is a huge indoor area full of tropical plants, flowers, a huge walkway and waterfall. It's pleasantly cool (but humid) in there, so gave us some welcome relief from the heat outside. It's actually a huge area to walk around so give yourself plenty of time to explore.The only reason this place isn't 5/5 is because inside the cloud dome it's not clear where to go - the path often branches and you're not sure if you're going to work your way round to that bit or accidentally miss something out. A few signposts would solve this.I've reviewed the super trees separately, which are INCREDIBLE, so don't miss those."
"There are 2 parts of the Garden, namely Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. There were many different species of plants from different continents to see. The place was beautiful and clean. The man made waterfall was amazing. It's recommended to visit this place if you enjoy looking at plants and flowers."
This is one of the most iconic and must see place when you visit Singapore. See the super trees and flowers from all over the world.Both the indoor and outdoor sections are visit worthy. Make sure to see the musical performances of the supertrees! Simply wonderful!
"Its beautiful, worth a visit, everything is picture perfect. Art was nice. The waterfall was amazing."
"What a place to spend time with kidos.Very nicely maintained .Good view of skyline .Lift appeared bit costly .Cons.No proper guidance about where to go and what to see ,so gave 4 *"
One of the MUST VISIT place in Singapore. Just a short walking distance from Marina Bay to Gardens by the Bay. I would recommend to go at night because the lighting at night is very beautiful and the weather at night is so windy there.
"We visited Gardens by the Bay in June 2019 and loved it. Spent half a day wandering and taking in the beauty of the place. It was crowded, but never shoulder-to-shoulder and the whole place is organised in a way to keep the foot traffic moving."
It is very beautiful and there is a very nice restaurant inside. Only thing is it is expensive however it is great visit
Beautiful park. Amazing biodomes. Stay for the light show - its well worth it. Use the loo when you pass one - I found it was a long walk when I really needed one. Queues to get out to plan to loiter a while in the hotel
Beautifully designed park with typical fake trees. Just good to go and see it. Especially at night it is worthwhile
Stunning. If you are into plants then this has to be on your bucket list. Toilets were mostly clean and this place is busy busy. Restaurants in the garden itself are over priced. But look out for all the sculptures. The evening lights are just stunning.
was so pretty at night time and we went on a tour which was a walking tour. We took many pictures and also went to the show and observation deck.
"Truly a work of art. A little crowded but worth the time. You can walk or take the shuttle, the light show at night is worth seeing."
"Having visited three times in three days, this place is brilliant and calming at the same time.The different areas of the gardens are relaxing (for those who enjoy gardening) but the light show and then the entertainment value of this park is exceptional.On a negative note!! We bought tickets to go up the Supertree but no one mentioned that there would be a closure on the 20th, so the ticket was invalid and they don't do refunds , sorry but that's poor!!! So we paid $6 more and went up to the higher sections, only to be told AFTER been persuaded to spend the extra money, that, if the weather changed they would be closing the higher deck.So sarcastically I did retort that maybe they should have told us all this before selling tickets ....Another group of people who had bought tickets by an agency had the same problem but they could not pay extra as we had, so walked off disgruntled!"
"Got tickets for floral fantasy , flower dome, cloud forest so might well visit one time. All of three , I think cloud forest is the best. Waterfall and skywalk around the lush greenery is nice. Nice ride at the end of floral fantasy. Flower dome I think is not flowery enough. Overall a nice place to visit"
"Great place for a visit, informative and lots to see. Felt staff were trying to get people to spend money unnecessarily such as on a 'half an hour' audio golf cart tour in which the guide kept skipping the audio and the tour went for less than 15 minutes. Taxi service was also super expensive to leave in the evening - $50 for only me to travel 4.1km - when I stated that it was a rip off and I'd walk they negotiated $30 which was still what I'd consider to be quite a rip off for the distance. For these reasons I cannot rate it 5 stars"
"The gardens outside are for free, including the Forest grove but you have to pay for the flower dome ($23, or $28 for dome and cloud forest). Plenty of restful places in the gardens, but a fair way from the Bayfront MRT, so you'll get a fair bit of exercise! The flower dome was a lot of a scrum when we were there, especially if you try and work your way around the masses of tourists wanting to spend ages taking pictures of their nearest and dearest in specific locations. There is a lot to see here if you have an interest in horticulture."
"The teen enjoyed photo ops. Very Disneyland-esque (think It's a Small World.) Worth seeing once but not twice. Hey, it's free!"
Spend money or not. It you are interested in just walking around the grounds there is no cost associated with that. Money spent on the cloud forest and other attractions is money well spent. Recommended.
"Display of seasonal flowers around the world, also an area for kidsNice and cool inside, relaxing and easy walkIt takes about an hour depending on your interest levelWe bought bundled visit of Flower Dome and Cloud Forest for SGD$28"
"This famous super tree structures offer an impressive skywalk over the gardens. Worthwhile visit in afternoon and evening for light show which their are two timings. General walk through gardens is no cost, however, to do anything else or visit other areas, there will,be a fee."
Awesome light show and things to do. This place provides a great experience for all ages with some stunning views of Singapore and iconic Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
The best place ..outstanding flowers.iam very happy to visit this .and the adventure in the buldieng
Nice asortment of flowers but I would really recommend going next door to the Cloud Forest. Spend more of your time there
"Alight from Station Bayfront MRT and walk to Garden By The Bay, this stretch of walk is not sheltered and can be quite hot when it is bright sunny day. Garden By The Bay is free entrance, but there are 2 conservatories that need ticket to enter, Flower Dome & Cloud Forest. Certain areas are quite cooling, elderly might need extra clothing."
This is an excellently developed I can say digital park unique structures that light up in the night the river fill up with colourful baloon like structures.Nice place to spend couple of hours well connected to the MRT for easier commute
"Gardens by the Bay is by now almost a 'must see' destination in Singapore, and we thoroughly enjoyed our daytime visit. I say daytime because others who have visited the place say the nighttime light shows are even better. The 'supertrees' are metallic structures which have been vegetalized, and a sky walkway some 25 meters above the ground connects two of them and offers great views of the Gardens and the Marina Bay Sands complex. The flower dome is billed as the largest greenhouse in the world - large it is indeed, and nicely cool as well, and the geographically themed parts of the dome very nice. We preferred the cloud forest, another greenhouse with an artificial 35 m high waterfall - you can walk up on a spiral walkway from ground level to the top..."
"Finally been here with my friends, we really enjoy the scenery and mostly the waterfall inside Cloud Forest. It's really cold inside the dome but refreshing so I like it very much. Maybe sometime I will comeback here at night to enjoy the other scenery and the lights too."
"We had a great time at the Gardens by the Bay, especially exploring the domes. It's pretty hot outside so it was hard to enjoy the gardens as much as we might have otherwise. Nevertheless, they are amazing."
"The light show was excellent, they have a few at separate times, we did the 7.45pm show.A lot of people but the taxis & the buses were well organised in shambolic traffic so arriving and leaving was fine, take a cab if you can or go with an organised tour.To me the highlights were the visit to the two domes, you had to pay an entrance fee but they were excellent."
"Inspiring! With the supertree grove in particular, stunning garden with loss to check out. Great establishment with restaurants, downside is that different attraction got its individual ticketing. Waste quite a lot of time just to line up."
"Amazing Building, all good if you like flowers. Maybe alittle overcrowded when we visited over New Years"
"We were disappointed with this as most of the area's were cleared for replanting, if we had been told when we bought the ticket we wouldn't have bothered"
"Great visit to Gardens by the bay. Do not miss OCBC skyway and the show, first one is at 7:45pm, music and lights in the trees.I think that other attractions last admission is at 8pm, so leave the show to the end. There are restaurants in the area.To leave there are taxis but count with a big queue."
Lovely gardens to wander around for the morning or afternoon. Done amazingly well with a great view of the city.
"In flower dome nothing much to see if you are not interested in flowers. Obviously u gonna get great picture and huge verity of flowers, fragrance and plants. Loved cloud dome though. Read timing of mist before you visit cloud dome coz it's amazing. Have Macdonald if you wanna see some cost effective options for brunch there."
"The Gardens by the Bay were lovely. We visited in Dec so brought tickets for both domes and the Winter Wonderland. The domes were spectacular and truly amazing and the gardens themselves were lovely. We were not impressed with the Winter Wonderland and it wasn't clear from the booking that we had to collect our tickets for this from a specific collection point rather than the normal ticket booths or that this was an evening only event. The gardens themselves also needed more signs of where different parts were and it was not clear on booking that the walkway between the trees was only available at certain times.These gardens are a must to see for all visitors to Singapore and they were amazing, but some improvement in the organisation is needed."
"We went here on a very bad day, it was hot and humid and it was tiring. The only thing I wanted was to escape someplace with A.C.We went though the domes as fast as we could. The gardens are still amazing, everything is very beautiful.I recommend not getting tickets with klook in advance because they are for the day you chose and if the weather doesn't allow you to do something, you cannot do the activity some other time or get a refund... The day we were there, there was supposed to be a storm so the walking bridge attraction was closed...We went back here on a different day when it was cloudy and the weather was nice, we explored the place without buying any tickets, spent around 3 hours just walking around and seeing all the free areas, and it was so much better than the first day.Another recommendation go there in the afternoon so you can catch the lights, we went around 2pm and finished before sunset, but maybe it was because of the hot weather."
"I've been 2 times visit this place and i can say i love this place. It was nice during my visit on December with the Christmas decoration. But, the plants and flower a bit withered, also nothing different since my previous visit on 2016."
Depending of the time you visit (we were here on a Friday night and on a Saturday) the place might feel a little bit too packed.It has a fantastical feel to it and even more so after sunset.
We had this on our to do list and almost didn't get around to it after a LONG day at Universal.Happy we pushed through and made the effort as enjoyed by all. Take a blanket if you worried about laying down on floor - much more enjoyable than staring upwards for 15 minutes which will give you a sore neck.
"I found it overrated.The cloud forest is good but flower dome can definitely be skipped. There are many flowers , many many species from all over the world but it is nothing compared to a natural garden. So paying 28SGd was totally a rip offBest thing was the light and sound show in the evening by the Supertrees."
"While in Singapore try visit the garden a great way to spend 4/5 hoursAs well as the grounds, the sky walk, the pavilion are amazing"
"As we walked in to the Garden by the Bay, we purchased the ticket to get into three arena. Waterfall, cloud Forrest and Floral Fantasy.There are lot for the flowers in Floral Fantasy. But they are not that great, as they all indoor. So we didn't spent too much time in here, so we quickly go to the Cloud Forrest. That was very chills due to the water fall when we walked in. These two arena all pretty cold. As due to Dec weather in Sing is pretty wet. So the whole indoor AC make the whole atmosphere like Autumn. That was nice for us to kill the whole hot afternoon. Good to be hang around there."
Lovely scenic area with great views everywhere. Expect a lot of people everywhere taking as many selfies as possible but once you get past all them you have an amazing view and displays to see. Recommend getting the combined ticked for all the displays and trees as much more economical and worthwhile.
"This is a beautiful place to visit but really packed in the evenings with long queues for everything. Allow yourself much more time than you think you need. The flower dome was a bit underwhelming but the cloud forest a bit better. The food court is always very busy so we never eat here. I think this place is best for a leisurely stroll when you have a lot of time and you don't want to go to any of the paid attractions like the sky walk, etc."
"A little over rated if I'm being honest. Sure, the gardens are lovely and the light show over the super trees are pretty decent but not on a par with Bellagio in Vegas.If you are in the area, go. If not - dont go out of your way, you're really not missing out on much"
"If you go to Singapore you have to see it.Not something spectacular but, very clean considering the flows all the day.We been there for X-mas and I can say if you have kids they will be very impressed with the X-mas decoration and the crowd around gives the feeling of X-mas and family.Everything is indoor but the AC a bit strong, so you feel good and can spend few hours around."
We went here at night hoping to shoot the Trees and found that they were shut off to highlight the Christmas structures that they erected.The Christmas decor were nice too but I was a bit disappointed because I was looking forward to shoot the lighted trees.The whole place is amazing because of the lights display. They are open until around 2 in the morning.The pond with big eggs with changing lights was also a sight to see.
"I have to confess that I'm not the greatest fan of visiting a garden. However, anyone in the world, no matter how skeptical or blasÃ©, will find something to be impress by, while visiting this yet another amazing achievement of the Singaporean government of which visionary endeavors don't cease to surprise me.If it's not the meticulous achievement to gather all these plants and trees from around the globe under one (huge!) roof or the care for them, it has to be the technical aspects of building and maintaining the largest unsustained greenhouse in the world."
"Make sure you don't miss the nightly tree of lights show at the Gardens by the Bay. 15 mins of choreographed music and lights - two showings per night, 7.45pm and 8.45pm. We were there at Christmas time so winter wonderland type fayre also present. Gardens by the Bay is a must for any visitors"
Nice place to relax and get away a bit from the city. Many good place to visit. Note though that the food around here is really bad and extensive so either eat beforehand or bring a snack.
"Gardens by the bay is impressive, although i'd only go once.I'd definitely say it's worth it and you should go. This review is nothing on the gardens itself, but more for the management to read and to give people a heads up.The skywalk part is managed terribly - there is no signage or clues to tell people who have waited in a 30 minutes line, that once they get to the front, they have to go find another stall to buy yet another ticket, and get their time stamp to do the skywalk.I saw over 50+ people get frustrated about this and the staff don't do anything to change it or feel no remorse - It is not hard to change this and make it clear to people who visit that they need a time code before queing up, as they then have to queue for that, and then the line they just waited in. Complete waste of everyone's time - i am so surprised no one in the staff has reported this or there's been no change after a year of seeing this happen day in and day out. Someone please take initative."
"Went directly to the Cloud Forest, which was lovely experience. Lots of flowers, plants, trees and a magnificent water fall. Easy to walk around with kids. Costs 12 SD for a kid and 20 SD for an adult. Worth visiting. Apparently you need to pay similar fee to the Flower Dome, but did not visit that this time.Then to the OCBC Skyway. Last time you get up there is at 9PM and you will need to get a time slot from the ticket booth after 7.30PM. The light show will be at 19.45 and 20.45 and we managed to see it first from the ground and then from the Skyway. Both were impressive but you get better pictures from the ground :)Do not go up to the Skyway if you are afraid of hights!"
"There's a light show at night too. A lot of tourist and crowd during weekend though so getting home was quite a trouble and had to squeeze while watching the light show. Have to walk quite a distance from Marina Bay Sands too. It was quite tiring, be prepared to spend the whole day to explore the area."
"Gardens by the bay are awesome. I liked cloud dome better than the flower dome. There are some amazing wood carvings, rocks and displays there. Loved it"
"If you like nature, plants, flowers, trees & grand design of 2 very cool green houses, you must visit Gardens by the Bay.Book & pay online to print your e-ticket, so that you don't need to lineup to buy tickets there. The 2 very cool green house domes are beautifully presented with world class design, a lot of plants from around the world, amazing waterfall, sky bridge foot path to let you walk back down to earth (ground level) & plenty of opportunities for incredible photos of the plants, flowers & trees. After visiting the 2 domes, you should walk toward the park 2 hours before sunset for more amazing photo opportunities of Marina Bay towers. The biggest let down is the quality of food at Gardens by the Bay food centre..... Why, why, why.... get Food Republic in there to fix up the issue. We don't mind paying around SG$15 for a meal, but the quality is below average. Sorry."
"You really have to admire Singapore government to be able to come up with this brilliant idea... tiny nation but really trying hard to plant as many trees as possible.... every bit man made, all trees transported and planted here... great planning, great maintenance and care"
It's an awesome place for nature lovers.. huge gardens.. the flower dome is awesome and so is the cloud forest with waterfall and all..!! The flower fantasy was also a nice addition. We were a little short on time and the place was very crowded being Christmas Eve.. !! One has to give this place atleast 4-5 hours.
"Visited solo in December 2019PROS:- Loved the waterfall and carnivorous plants- Skywalk experience was nice and gave a better feel of the olace- Good place to spend time wiyh family, specially the light show in evening- Food is awesome in the food court on the other side of bridge (unable to recall the name but you will find sign boards for guidance)CONS:- Christmas carnival was not at all attractive and needs separate ticket.- Light show must have been special till few years back but now its a common thing around the world, have seen similar stuff in Akshardham in New Delhi India- The whole experience seemed to be a bit stretched over the day, specially covering everything during day and then waiting for lights to comeon at night- OCBC Skywalk is mostly non operational in December due to climate issues. They are very cautious and dont allow operations even if there is only a chance of a rain. The online ticket that i purchased was non refundable had they not allowed a delayed entry after arguing for one hour anf waiting for 2.5 hours"
"We eventually found our way in after a few wrong turns on foot (our fault). The first thing I needed to do was visit the ladies... I'm sure there were plenty on site but the block I went to had only two cubicals (one for 'squatting') so the queue was long. We arrived in the centre just as the evening light display started, it was stunning! Well worth the visit. We didn't pay for any of the exhibits as it was too late to make the most of them."
"Beautiful night views; too long for those with walking disability. Also, loading of photos : before can load, review already posted"
"Lovely place, fantastic concept of bringing greens, trees, shrubs, cactus from all over the world to be shared with urban tourists, locals who may not have any chance to visit the actual locations where these greens are found."
"Heard so much about this place, seen it from the roads. Finally made it to visit but it was so crowded that we couldn't visit one of the place we purchased. Get there early so you can see all the different attractions. The new one has to purchase ticket at the attractions. It would be nice to be able to purchase all the tickets from the ticket office."
"Got last minute tickets for the Gardens by the Bay. Very impressed. Well organised and lots to see. If you love gardening, you must visit"
"It was a Christmas program lights and sound. Enjoyable. Visited the gardens of Mediterranean, Africa and so on. However did not have that much time. Recommend keep at least 3 hours to see all."
"We bought the double attraction tickets to the flower dome and the Cloud Forest. There was a line to get into the Cloud Forest Dome but it was only about 10 minutes. It kept moving. We were so excited to get in and feel the cool air and see the massive waterfall. Then we started walking inside and realized there was another really long line. We had no idea. So we waited about 50 minutes in a line to get to the elevator. The line keeps moving and you are walking along pretty flower beds as you wait in line, but it's a FIFTY minute line. No way to use stairs to go up. We contemplated NOT waiting and going up but we are SO glad we did. The views and walkways from the top are really amazing and just seeing the stuff on the main path at the bottom would NOT have been worth the money. As it is, it's a really expensive way to see some flowers. Many cities have botanical gardens for a few dollars that are just as beautiful. I'm glad I went ONCE, just to see it. But I'll never go again. Not for that price. Not too mention, the super long line inside the Cloud Forest dome made it so we didn't have enough time to do the Flower Dome. So money wasted. We also bought tickets to do the walkway. We bought the tickets about 4pm. And then went back about 6pm to get our ""assigned time"" which happened to be 7:40 which was awesome because we were ON the walkway during the 7:45 light show. The walkway was really fun and totally worth the $8 price. The line to use the elevator was short and easy, since they assign times (after 5pm they start assigning times on a first come first serve basis. you can get in the line to go up the elevator at your assigned time. It makes it really doable. But need to buy tickets a few hours early!!!) . They light show was really fun and the views were incredible and we all really enjoyed it. When the light show finished everyone was hungry for dinner so we went to the foodcourt place right there at the super trees. It was PACKED! It took some in our group 2 hours to get their food. crazy! During that time we were able to step outside and easily see the 8:45 light show from the ground. Really fun to see from the ground also. I do NOT recommend going to the foodcourt anytime after 7:30. The food is mediocre and pricey and the place was a madhouse! If we didn't have hungry kids with us, we would definitely have just walked and found something else. It's a really fun area to walk around and explore. Lots of nice walking paths. Great in the evening with the cooler weather and all the lights and buildings and water. I'll go back to the area to walk around and enjoy the paths but I will NOT pay for the domes again and we probably won't do the walkway or light show again. Once was enough. It's too crowded. Definitely take water and eat elsewhere. We did refill water bottles using the drinking fountain near the bathrooms. We walked there from Chinatown. 30 minute walk or 27 minutes on metro. So we walked and it was a really nice walk!"
You need to be reasonably fit to visit here . It's worth a look though . Take water with you . It's very hot walking around .
"Beautiful gardens, must visit if you are in Singapore. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes since there is a lot of walking!"
It was a good visit. We especially enjoyed the visit to Cloud Forest. The orchids there were very beautiful and many of them we saw them the first time.
"Gardens by the bay , is a rejuvenating refreshment to the eyes and soul and breaks any negative bias associated with the term 'Gardens' you might have.It has two paid parks Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. The Former is a manmade representation of how forest in Amazon grows, beautiful, falls, mists and walkway created to give you a feel of what it could be.Flower Dome is a collection of various flowers , as do exist in a typical garden but with a modern feel.Besides there's a OCBC skyway, good for a one time visit but reach before sunset if you want to have nice photos. However the associated laser show towards end of day ( 2 timings) is really interesting.There's a lot of free area associated with Gardens by the bay which is a very nice 2 hours walk to the Gardens and a good day visit to locals. If you are visiting Singapore for a short time, it can be completely skipped."
"Visited the Gardens by the Bay at Christmas time....During the day it was a visit to the Flower and Cloud Forest Domes, which were really impressive.Then a return in the evening, when the light show was the main attraction.However, as it was Christmas time, there was an additional benefit of the Christmas lights...and the general fun and merriment of the occasion.Well worth a visit, at any time of year."
"Was not expecting much but was very pleasantly surprised. A great variety of different types of gardens, all cleverly laid out. Lots and lots of photo opportunities. Was here at Xmas and many of the displays were xmas orientated which i found excessive, but i am sure others would have liked it. Best buy combined entry with the Cloud Forest."
A wonderful Airconditioned man made nature paradise that gives you the feelings of being in several countries all at once.Beautiful blooming flowers and landscaping with descriptive panels adds to the learning journey.Highly recommended to visit
"I must admit that I only had a couple of hours to explore this beautiful work of art, and so I skipped the Flower and Cloud Forest Domes (which had fees to get into) and I chose to explore the free gardens. The Gardens were thoughtfully created and all the lush greenery was just soothing to the eyes. The Supertree Grove was definitely amazing. I just wish I had more time to walk around and go up to the OCBC Skywalk. Definitely wear your most comfortable walking shoes which is a must for any sightseeing tour of any city. This Garden is huge and you'll have to walk everywhere to fully explore it."
Together with the Christmas Celebration. It is simply awesome theme. The decoration and lighting is beautiful.
Is a very nice and huge flower dome. They change theme occasionally. During our visit was a Sakura flower.Must visit cloud forest just opposite of the flower dome.
"Well maintained & creatively crafted gardens attract a good number of tourists all over the year. Within Gardens by the bay, you can see 3 major attractions Flower dome, Cloud forest and Supertree Grove with OCBC skyway. All attractions are worth seeing and recommend to visit the place at twilight so that light show at supertree grove must not be missed.If you want to see the Gardens in details you may have to free yourself for at least 4-5 hours."
"We're there 2 days before Christmas Eve , a Sunday evening, and it was unbelievable crowded. We had to pay 10SGD for the Christmas market entry fee, which would have been ok if there would not have been so many people!"
Pretty and worth the trip. Playgrounds good. Take swimmers for kids to play in water park. Nice views back to the city and Marina Bay Sands.
Very interesting gardens but was disappointed with the light show which was just changing colours. The Marina Bay Sands light show is far more spectacular.
2nd time at Christmas Wonderland! Crowded but managable and beautiful! Just that the rides and games are too expensive.
It would be better if the gardens be opened till 10pm. Enjoyed the variety of flowers. Would be good if food operators like macdonalds have more seats and more counters given the huge crowds of people who visit the Gardens.
Nice visit with my friend and uncle. I would like to have a guide in my next visit and I would like to spend more time in each and every place. Totally it was nice experience
"Excellent place to visit. We were lucky that we visited there on just around the Christmas. It was all having a lovely Christmas theme. Otherwise also, beautiful place to visit.My suggestion is to visit there by late afternoon, so that you can finish it after the sunset, during which it is more admirable due to the spectacular lighting decorations.We were little disappointed in the Flower Dome as apart from few varieties of flowers, rest everything was just green and green and lots of varieties of cactus. Nevertheless it was still good to see all that.Cloud forest is one thing you can't miss. Beautifully made and with a tall man made water fall.Later in the evening, you can visit the tree groves and if u like can have a walk on the sky bridges which connects the tree groves (OCBC Skywalk).Ince you finish there, just walk over to the other side towards the Marina Bay Sand Hotel. Have a stroll and shop if you like and enjoy the Fountain Show on the river side of the Marina Bay. Two shows daily at 8:00 pm and then 9:00 pmOverall it was a good visit and we enjoyed."
Unfortunately the weather wasn't great- pouring with rain and the Christmas markets meant some of the park couldn't be accessed without paying. Well worth a visit but in good weather
"It was a blessing in diguise. Due to heavy rain. We had to skip watching the lion's dance performance at Marina platform. At around 6.45pm we left the place and walk to the GBTB. Wow heavy human traffic at the entrance. Queuing up like a snake. We decided to walk outside the garden. Moving slowly at our own space & explore the garden from different angle. What my camera capture were amazing scene from different angles and I am not someone whom is easily impress of what I had seen but this spectacular image that I had captured changes my mind. Free view n every corners that we walked is making my camera wanting to capture all that is happening. Spacious surrounding,very good for couple, family and friends, tourists and making very cents worth visiting this place. I spent about 1 1/2 hours moving around. If you have time buy a ticket n enter the Dome which I haven't try myself. My friends all very impress with the landscaping at different occasions n will try one day. You can also watch my Youtube video where I had uploaded one or 2 videos on GBTB n others nature walk around SG n some of cooking recipes at C Z (with a lion head)or ask for request to join in my instagram at charlene zhuang. Give a thumbs up or comments where I can improve my skills.Below are some of the pictures that is swallow by my mobile cam and hope you like it.Bayfront MRT station is where you should b alighting and have your diner first before walking. Carry a small drink bottle around. Food wise not really sighted unless you are at the Dome where a small cafe n a ATAS restaurant, souvenir shop. Enjoy and whatever I had stated here is all my personal opinion."
"A day well spent at the gardens.I would recommend the cloud forest. It is a beautiful walk and offers great views of the Marina bay Hotel, singapore flyer and the city. The misting of the mountain was a bit disappointing, but the waterfall was beautiful.The flower dome was disappointing, they had a great display of Christmas decorations,but the flowers were limited. I wouldn't recommend spending money to see this.The floral fantasy had a vast array of beautiful flowers, but it was a short expedition. The animation at the end was great, especially for young children.The shuttle service is helpful, especially if elderly are travelling but it is manageable to walk from the entrance to the 2 indoor garden areas.The gardens do allow free access to certain parts, but you have to may for the cloud forest, flower dome and floral fantasy. Shuttle service and OCBC walk also requires payment.I would recommend a full day to take your time. Alternatively is can be done in the afternoon with the viewing at night which is spectacular."
Definitely worth a visit to see these amazing biodomes. They feature unique plant species from all over the world.
"The attraction is free unless you want to see the light show, which I really recommend $10 each, plus another $10 if you want to walk the tree line - again well worth it at night to see the lights .This is a fabulous place that has lots to offer everyone, there are food and beverages and a gift shop, however going in December when the lights are on makes it really special"
Absolutely amazing place to visit. So much to see and experience. While you you walk around you are trying to take in so much .
"Defiantly good value for money, some very interesting displays.Give yourself at least two hours to be able to see all the plants"
Went during the week and did the Skywalk during the day to avoid paying the Xmas premium ! View was fabulous. At night visited the Cloud and Flower Gardens which are extremely freezing and not as impressive as imagined. Equally please note that you MUST have done the flower dome before since they close the entry off at 8pm! A guided dummy walk through the settings we were not enchanted.Overall you go there for the pictures not the actual content
"Awesome set up for the X'mas wonderland , it does feel like Christmas in Sg , the moment you stepped into the set up. Great job to the organizer! Cheers"
"Really nice light show with classical music in giant trees. No costs, free entrance.Don't forget to bring your foto/video camera with you!Note:And the Chinese and Indian garden are also free."
"If you love flowers, plants, flora - you will love it here. The flowers changes every 3 mths so it's different every 3 mths you visit."
Excellent and enormous indoor (air conditioned) greenhouse with very nice garden displays. A little bit contrived but overall a good spot to relax and enjoy many types of flora. Weekends can be very busy which can take away from the overall experience. (our only complaint)We skipped the flower dome. We peered in to see if we missed anything....we didn't
"We were on a two night stop over and brought tickets from the hotel to this attraction . We travelled on the subway , which was extremely clean & much better than the tubes in London ( which I hate ) . From the subway the gardens are well signposted . The gardens are huge and unfortunately due to our jet lag and the heat we didn't manage to see it all.We did find the ticket situation confusing as you need to pay extra to see some parts . We had intended to stay until the evening so we could see the towers lit up but our tickets only gave access to 3:30 pm and then due to the Christmas show you had to buy additional tickets for access from 5 pm .There are a couple of snack bars / cafes and a restaurant plus the usual MacDonalds (Yuk) . You could easily spend all day here especially if you like gardening but be aware of the heat"
Well worth a visit albeit the pricing is a bit mad. Combinations of this and that sight but ultimately at cÂ£20pp not bad. Our visit was impacted by a monsoon so could only do the Cloud forest and flower dome as inside. So missed Xmas wonderland and tree walk. The shuttle was useful especially as the weather was inclement. If you are dodgy with heights and suffer from vertigo then the cloud forest and tree walk in the special trees are a challenge!
Must visit when in Singapore. The supertrees are so cool. Really lovely at night with all the lights.
"We booked to go to the Gardens by the Bay on a mid afternoon slot which we knew would lead into the early evening time - our idea was we would get the best of both, explore the indoor stuff and all the flowers etc in the light and then get the SuperTree show at nightfall! And we loved it!A MUST DO whilst in Singapore really, was as reasonable priced as you could expect for Singapore and we spent roughly 3-4 hours there if I remember correctly. The flowers, trees and everything in the gardens are absolutely beautiful and as for the SuperTrees and the show it was absolutely spectacular, really was blown away by it! The views from the bay in general are just fantastic and very romantic!A final note, we found it easy to get too by taxi or it looked like it was reasonable to get to by foot also.100% recommended."
"We had hoped to visit these gardens the night before and watch the light show with the music but jetlag got in the way.As we had a few hours to kill in the morning, we took a taxi from the hotel down to these gardens and had a wander round. Very pleasant. It was quite early in the morning and it was good to see that they are well used by local joggers and walkers. I only visited the botanic house. Which was decorated in a Christmas style at the time. It was interesting and air conditioned, which was welcome"
Nice n refreshing place to spent time with family members. There are many species n colourful flowers and plants for photo shoot.
"It was so fun that my friend and I had a great time in Gardens By The Bay! We planned to get the tickets through online along with the Christmas bundle season. We are able to choose withing two dorms OR just one including with the Christmas Wonderland ticket since it is Christmas bundle. We managed to get the two dorms and Christmas Wonderland ticket online. It was so smooth and the staff are very welcoming. At 4pm itself, we left Cloud Forest and saw so many visitor queuing up to purchase the Christmas Wonderland ticket. To me, it's worth paying the tickets to get to visit the Gardens By the Bay as a holiday activity. I advised and highly recommend visitors to get their tickets online as it is much easier and minimum time of queuing."
"Gardens by the Bay is a beautiful and full of garden artistry concept place with flowers and fauna. My visit was during this Christmas season which the bay all set with Christmas displays and decorations, worth to spend time to enjoy the nature of it!"
"Love this area, free park area walking amongst the super tall man made trees. Amazing structures. There is a restaurant inside this vast area to cool off and have refreshments along the way. There are paid options to go up to the top of the trees as well. We did not visit at night when the lights were on but have heard they are stunning."
"I must confess to beings a bit underwhelmed by these gardens, mainly I think because the large artificial trees look just that, artificial. Stills,a pleasant area to visit and while away an hour or so."
"A beautiful concept, truly with a visit. Take your time and wander through picturesque paradise.Our visit was during the day, as we were into flowers and fauna. However a night visit when all the lights turn is a totally different experience.Do both!!"
Superb views from the Gardens by the bay. We like the nature of the garden and the bridge which gives you a panoramic view of Singapore!
"Gardens' does not do this place justice. It is 100 hectares of lush tropical forest with walkways and water features. There are play parks for kids and designated picnic areas but the main event is the pay to enter attractions namely the misty mountain and floral garden both of which are a must see and worth the entrance fee. In the mountain walk you can see meat eating plants and walk through a corridor of orchids. There a huge waterfall and tropical plants and trees from all around the world. Inside, it is a riot of colors and smells wonderful.In the floral gardens they already had a Christmas theme set up so you can walk through pine trees to Santa's cabin and all the rest of it. Needles to say, it wears packed full of super happy kids!Inside or out (even in the rain!), this is a beautifully maintained well laid out forest-garden-park walk.A must see.Tip: the giant steel flowers. Walk (climb). Them only if you are fit and active as it is a tiring climb just to see the trees from above but most importantly. Time your visit here so that you can see these trees at night. The subtle light show is truly lovely and you cannot come to singapore and miss this night time attraction"
"this is already my 4th time visiting gardens by the bay, and if i may say, it will get boring sometime if you dont know what the flower theme will be. to me, i really love christmas and its wonderful decoration, so seeing Poinsettia and christmas trees every year is not a big of a deal."
Great concept. We have wonderful experience there. Buy 2 bundling tickets for flower dome & cloud forrest. There are free area around the dome which so great too. Definetely a must visit when you go to Singapore.
There is no charge to enter the gardens so dont be sold a ticket unless you want to go inside the domes or walk the aerial walk between the man made trees.Very nice at dusk when the light show begins. We did the aerialk walk and the cloud dome. Both were experiences that once done dont need to be repeated in my opinion. The gardens are very pleasant to walk around though
"The domes were amazing. Especially the cloud dome.The walkway was interesting but visiting early december made it a christmas visit, so loads of plinky plonky carols."
A great place to visit both day and night. I initially visited during the day lovely and peaceful even though busy lovely scenery great photo opportunities. I visited again at night as I wanted to see the lights and music show as it is Christmas show at the moment it costs to get in but normally it's free. You can still see and hear from the outside so if you are trying to budget it can still be done. The area is quite busy at night but loads to see and the area is so different at night with all the lights
"Spent a couple of hours walking around, which is magical. Christmas wonderland was open. We paid $20 each to walk the botanical glass houses which were lovely well stocked and professionally planted. My beef was the price as this money didnt include the bridge walk or access to lazer lights. Few places to eat, including McDonalds and good toilets around. Mostly flat walking good paths"
We spent time wandering around this park and stayed for the evening show of lights and music in the trees. Well worth the visit.
Visited this very nice green garden where you can see the famous Supertree . Recomended to bring hats as it is very hot during sunny day. Do take a lot photos here at the garden
"Used the mrt to get here which was easy to do, when we arrived you have got a couple of options to choose, we chose all we went into the cloud walk which was fabulous quite high up there is lifts and escalator for anyone who can't do steps. The gardens were lovely and informative. We went into the flower room which was ok just all Christmas things and the other fantasy room was amazing. We could not do the sky walk as we had torrential rain so they had to close it, good place to visit while in Singapore it was busy but great for kids as well as adults and a look at dragonfly lake is fab"
Beautiful Christmas light display and gorgeous view on the tree top walk to the city and the city gardens.
"If you like taking pictures for social media, this is the place to go.Otherwise, I got bored pretty easily.To make the trip worth it, get ready to do a lit of walking so check the weather forecast amd make sure it will not rain that day"
Large area with small representations of areas of the world. Much better actually going there but if you can't this is ok
Gardens by the Bay is such a large are and the facilities are truly impressive! Specifically the two indoor conservatories are some of the most impressive structures I have ever seen. It's pretty awesome how they were able to create such elaborate climate controlled environments.The only downside here is the crowds. It feels a bit like a theme park at times with thousands of people being herded like sheep and everyone trying to get the perfect picture. It's a little annoying but definitely still worth a visit.
Best Visited at night with Plenty of visitors.Nice light show and it's free to just walk around the garden.
"Worthwhile visiting this splendid city garden with its flower dome and cloud forest. Fascinating displays and information on orchids, highland plants, as well Mediterranean and sub tropical plants. An interesting array of varied colours of the Christmas poinsettia were also on display for Christmas."
Cloud Forest is always my favourite esp the man-made water fall. The theme changes every quarter. This winterland theme one at Flower Dome is not impressive. The team behind it needs to step up
"We were hosted a faculty dinner at this place.We all reached there an hour earlier and went round the garden.At first sight it looks artificial , but it is so deceptive especially with the artificial light, it indeed is natural only very well maintained. The cactus garden is very nice so also the rest of the floral areas - a delight to any photographer. The dining area was also well laid out and we were very well taken care of."
"The evening light show is truly magical and I would recommend anyone to go and check this out when visiting Singapore.We paid entry for a couple of the domes, the flower dome and the cloud dome, and whilst they are fantasticly man made structures we weren't all that wowed by them. They were too busy and in my opinion not worth the money.The tree top walk however was very good and I'd highly recommend anyone try that out for fantastic views."
"I really enjoyed the gardens and cloud dome , the forest walk way provided great views of the city and walking through the meadow is very relaxing."
"The plants & flowers are all in a natural setting & amazing to see. Inspires you to go home & see what you can do in your garden. BUT,the site is not mobility friendly! they have a few wheelchairs but there are many hills to traverse. I recommend they buy electric 3 wheel scooters which can be used by the mobility impaired like they do in many shopping malls these days. Surely such a Hi-Tech place like Singapore could organise this easily?"
Amazing light show at 7:45 and again at 8:45. Well worth wondering around in the dark to see Singapore skyline
"This is one of Singapore's main attractions, and for a reason. The variety of plants is impressive and the whole area is well laid out for tourists. It would be a shame to go to Singapore without seeing this iconic spot, however it wasn't my favorite thing on the island."
A really beautiful location in central Singapore. Really worth a visit if you're in the country.Went here with friends and we all thought it was worth looking at.
"We entered Gardens By The Bay via the Marina Bay Sands. We took a lift to a magnificent garden path that overlooks the gardens. We then went down another lift at the other end. The gardens are peaceful and hold a lot of interesting artful sculptures and plants.There's a small train which doesn't charge much that will take you to the domes.The gardens themselves are even more magnificent in the dark when the neon gardens light up.As for the domes.The Flower Dome had a large array of beautiful rhododendrons each flower prettier than the first, (we had missed the orchids flowing season) it also had gardens based on countries, and we were amused when a tour guide explained that the maleleuca was used to make maleleuca honey. We didn't correct him.The Cloud Dome was even better. It has a waterfall inside. Walking along a path, when you reach the top of the dome it makes you feel like you are walking in the clouds using a specialised misting machine. The effect also assists in watering the mountain off plants that grow up the man made mountain inside the dome.If you look hard you will see several sculptures that look like they've been made from driftwood and a lion carved from a tree.There's also a plant in a glass case that is the last of its kind.Views of the outside off the dome are also spectacular."
Amazingly decorated for Christmas in the Flower Dome. Cloud is also amazing. The show at night is stunningly. Got up the skybridge worth seeing the view especially at sunset or when the lights are all on.
Defiantly a nice experience in Singapore. Lots to see and really nice displays. However try to go at a time when it isn't not overcrowded. Too many kids running around like crazy take away from it.Besides that it's a must see in Singapore.
"Definitely worth a visit. Flower Fantasy was a fantasy. If you love plants - take your time, don't rush through it. There is little surprises under the plants which you can miss if you rush through."
Going solo or with family you'll enjoy this great example of practical teaching about the environment. Recommend: Cloud Forest and Flower Dome.
"We went in the morning on the weekend still very busy with lots of both locals and tourists. We took the metro to marina bay and then is is a quick underground walk to the gardens. Shuttles operate to take you to he gardens proper if you want, a little cost.Great facilities and worth while seeing. Lots of places to sit and rest if required as still gets pretty hot if your not used to the heat."
"Gardens by the Bay, SingaporeReview focuses on the Skyway & Supertree GroveThe Gardens by the Bay is Singapore at its best. The gardens come in three parts: Bay South, Bay East & Bay Central, of which Bay South is the largest (54 ha) and attracts the majority visitors ' for most, this is the park. It registered the 50th million visitor in 2018 just six years after opening. The park skirts Marina Bay on land reclaimed from the sea and exemplifies the vision of the government of the day for the development of a 'city in a garden' ' raising the quality of urban life by emphasizing the aesthetic values that comes from access to and/or living in green space.Walk around the park '¦ slowly '¦ and the visual elegance of the place comes across immediately. But there's more beneath the galaxy of different green/floral gardens within the park - the sophistication of the conservatories (i.e. Cloud Forest & Flower Dome), fun for kids of all ages in the water-play garden and the Supertree Grove - there are the environmental messages/systems that simulate the reality of photosynthesis, water harvesting, energy capture, heat disposal and more. This is a playground with features that entertain and inform ' what you don't see (unless you look for it) are layers beneath layers that underlie the complexity of the bioengineering required to support, nurture and sustain the botanical heritage that has been established.Sit at a table outside the Supertree Food Hall facing the Supertree Grove (with the iconic Marine Sands Bay Building behind) and there's this vista of green exuberance. The Supertrees are not real trees ' but tree-like structures 25-50 m high - that resemble trees in form and symmetry, and vegetation that has been established/grown to cover the underlying structure. In fact, the 'trees' have a reinforced concrete core with external steel frame to which are attached planting panels ' that form the basis of vertical gardens. Of course you can see it's not a real tree, but it feels like one when up close and, more so, when seen from a distance and/or when exploring the aerial walkway halfway up the trees.It was a Sunday, and we'd taken the MRT to Marina South Pier (end of the line terminus station) that morning to explore the Singapore Maritime Gallery and, couple hours later, figured to walk through the Gardens by the Bay; the distances are comfortable on foot ' once you're in the park ' the main challenge. We were not certain about crossing the Marina Coastal Expressway that skirts this part of the island and tends to cut the beach off from the hinterland. People whom we asked did not seem familiar with the 'walking' aspect (and tended to discourage it ' 'take a taxi' etc. crept into the discussion).Well, by chance there was a 14-seater courtesy bus that ran the route on the half-hour ' nice touch; we had the bus to ourselves with a courteous driver who dropped us off just inside the park. What could have been more convenient - thanks to the friendly man at the Information Desk at Marina South Pier.We've been to the Gardens a number of times over the years ' always a good half-day wandering and exploring; always new things to see. Finding a convenient lunchtime coffee/snack opportunity, however, was a key priority. Lots of signposts/maps around and there's no issue with finding your way. We crossed the Meadow heading into the centre of the park, skirted the Supertree Grove and then into the Food Hall, and out again (too noisy). Immediately outside was the cafÃ© that we were seeking. First impressions? Light, spacious, dominated by high pillars holding up the concrete road/footpath above, views into the Supertree Grove and, crucially, empty tables/seats ' great.We had not originally intended to explore the OCBC Skyway, but it was there just a few metres away. Why not! Snack finished we headed off across the grove to catch the elevator that would take us up 22 m to the walkway that loops around three of the supertrees - to hang out over the edge and take time to explore the park, buildings and distant open water by eye.Surprisingly there were relatively few people there. The kiosk is directly opposite the elevator (inside the 'trunk' of the nearest Supertree). We paid S$8/each for our tickets and, five minutes later, we had the walkway largely to ourselves. Lots of deck space at either end of the walkway where you gain access and then, one circuit 128 m later, where you return to the ground.In between there's this 'in-the-sky' feel about things given the uncluttered design of the walkway, chest-high open/netted sides topped by a handrail over which you can lean, width that varies between 1.5-3 m and oval/semi-circular curve that continues to point you in a different direction as you walk. No, there's no issue with 'height, exposure, apprehension, etc.' you can't for example, see through the deck beneath your feet.That said, leaning over the rail we lost a hat to the wind - watched it float down into a flower garden at the base of one of the Supertrees ' good no one would see it there; they didn't and 20 minutes later we rescued it.In the distance you can see across Marina Bay towards the Bay East Gardens and, further towards the sea, there's the Marina Barrage (where you can cross over to the other gardens). We were heading that way to visit the Sustainable Singapore Gallery (opened June 2018) and explore the development of water resources in the island.Key/final point ' there's no entry fee into the park ' gardens, lakes, children's play area too; you pay for entry into the specialized features ' conservatories, aerial walkway.Peter Steele10 November 2019"
It's interesting for the evening light show. If you go on the canopy walk make sure to go in the evening when there is a light show. Otherwise you have to watch the light show from the ground.I'm just not that interested in evening light shows or man made tourist attractions.
"A garden full of color, full with elegant plants. Aside from huge trees which make you surprised, there are two other attractions (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) within the garden, but you must pay to get into. You may find the entrance prices a bit high. However the garden itself is for free and it is even more amazing at evening hours with the light shows. The best time to visit is the late afternoon hours tin order to spend time and extend the stay until evening hours at dark. You will like the exhibition."
our second visit and this place is still exceptional.The Christmas decor was vibrant.The cloud forest is still among my favorites with the spectacular glass and skywalk.Always worth a visit when in Singapore!
The garden sits in the heart of the city and is a feature attraction it is free and at night there is an amazing light show over an amazing place
"This is a typical Singaporean way of enjoying flowers etc., covered halls and going out in a comfortable not to warm environment. The garden is very well organized as well as good infrastructual set up. The flower beds are beautiful and the place is good for an hour relaxed walking and enjoying the garden architecture."
I love gardens because it's very relaxing. Knowing Singapore has this gardens by the way in the middle of the busy city is truly breathtaking and awesome. Best time to go here is in the afternoon so it's not too hot specially outside the dome.
love coming here during the weekdays. less crowds and i can take my own time to walk around. Plenty of pretty flowers and plants to look at if you like flowers and plants . it just makes your day better
"I would recommend going in the early afternoon when they light is good for seeing the plants and good photos of them/oneself. Allow a minimum of three hours (personally would prefer five and would spend more in domes). Stay for the light show (free at 7:45 & 8:45pm, but could be quite a distance from the domes). For a good spot (eg. lying down) to see the show, you may want to be there early (I saw people started waiting one hour ahead).The only complain I have is that the plant signs appear random and sporadic. The air-cond could be a bit much for some."
"This was an interesting place. Lots of walking so wear comfy shoes. Honestly it looked better in the movie, but still worth a visit."
Nice place for a walk. I highly recommend it if you want to run away from the city lifeThere is a light show at 7.45 PM and it's crowded.
Complicating system to choose which ones to visit . We saw one of the flower domes and the cloud forest. Amazing what humans can build if there is enough heat and water.
"Of the two facilities, Flower dome and Cloud Forest, the Cloud Forest was spectacular. The waterfall was amazing, and the elevated/suspended walkways gave great views. The 'cheesiness' related to elaborate flowers made of LEGO inserted into regular displays - weird.The flower dome was underwhelming, but is part of the package so might as well go. Unfortunately, we did not have a chance to see the Super Tree light show that night, which we did want to see."
"I had read and watched so much about this place, but being there was a little underwhelming. Yes, there are beautiful flowers from around the world, but I think I would have enjoyed something natural better. I did love the 'eggs' in the bay and the large dragonfly statues. And the dragon sculptures throughout the cloud forest were definitely worth seeing. The Flower dome was decorated for Christmas, which seemed uncharacteristic for Singapore, maybe this explains why I was a little disappointed. I left the US, to see the US. All in all, it's still worthy of a visit and my four stars for sheer beauty."
Although I have been before U have never been in the flower dome. And it's superb. Especially now as there is a wonderful white Christmas there. Just fabulous
Visiting Gardens by the Bay was very unique experience and It has variety of plants. It is surly one of the top experience of Singapore
Marvellous Human creation....The flowers..The waterfall and everything about the gardens is awesome.
"Very nice gardens, especially the waterfall.A lot of effort is being put to renew the themes in the garden.Just remember to take a jacket as temperatures can be cold"
"We went at dusk and thoroughly enjoyed the visit, but it was not as good as its marketing suggests. Sure it is a bit unusual and the canopy height walk is fun, even the light show is very worthwhile. Somehow though we were just rather underwhelmed.If you are here for a few days then go and visit but don't expect it to be a real highlight."
We were on a stopover so got the SMRT to the Bay and walked to the gardens. It was quiet when we arrived and was raining heavily but it didn't spoil the experience. We went into the flower dome which was beautiful and fragrant with lovely water displays. We went into the dragonfly theatre which was n unusual experience. Back out into the gardens to explore and it was great to see the 'boat' hotel and also the giant flowers. We had also viewed the light display of the flowers from the 57th floor of the hotel the night before. A real experience.
"The music and light show in the evening was so beautiful and clever. It was crowded, as you would expect. I would recommend taking something to sit on while waiting for the show to begin - the curbing is not comfortable ;-DWe wandered round the gardens for an hour or so before that, and"
This was a really good place to spend the day and if you have children they would love it. it really is a full day and to make the most of it its best to book in advance. the evening's light and music display is not to be missed so plan your stay carefully
"Super cooling, managed to handle crowds inside but bottleneck was at the entrance. However, understandable.Overall, great experience. Loved the diversity and look of it all."
"It's such a beautiful and peaceful setting with lots to see.There are two main areas: Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, but there are also a couple of other attractions.You can also see the Supertrees from here. I would recommend coming back in the evening to see them lit up.You can easily spend a good few hours here wandering."
"I heard so much about the gardens I've actually put them on my to-do list as a main thing. Well.. the place is amazing, great amount of work and planning, lots of green etc. A nice place to have a walk for sure. Was it my number 1 in Singapore? No. But definitely worth visiting."
Singapore being a small country has a good variety of places to see. Gardens by The Bay probably is one that should be kept in the top 3 when you visit Singapore.
Have visited the Gardens each time I have been in Singapore. It is very crowded at times but I do enjoy the coolness in the Cloud forest and taking pictures of all the flowers in the flower dome.
Beautiful gardens to spend a nice evening..the entry is paid but totally worth it if you are a nature lover
"The way that flowers and plants are arranged in the dome is impressive at first, but once you've been there for 30 minutes or so the experience begins to drag on a bit. The light show is neat for the first minute or so, but really is not that great. There are no lasers with mist or fog, no fancy projections, only some colored lights that flash to accompany the various songs that play. Keep your expectations low and I guess it is worth seeing once."
"A lovely place to take a stroll and see many different plants ans flowers, a few sculptures here and there. The food places are very touristy. Skip them. Gift shop not worth it."
"Must visit place in singapore, its freshening and kids really enjoy a place with so many vibrant colors around"
A good place to visit if the weather is hot. Plenty of shade plus Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are air conditioned to a steady temperature. Lots to see including plants you would otherwise not get to see. Waterfall in Cloud Forest is impressive. Avoid weekends if you can as it gets very busy I am told. Only complaint is that the coffee shop/restaurant in Flower Dome was closed for a private function and you had to go outside to find cafe etc. Ask for a re-entry stamp!Expect to spend several hours here and perhaps follow this up with a visit to the viewing platform on top of Marina Bay hotel.
This is a great day out - the flora displays are quite stunning and refreshed on a regular basis. Samples from around the world and easy to see while strolling round teh dome. A worthwhile visit.
"Loved the gardens by the bay. We went early to avoid the crowds, which worked although it mean you don't get to see the night time lights on the skywalk. Definitely a must for any Singapore visit."
"A trip here is the perfect way to get away from the hustle and bustle, and you are encouraged to take your time and enjoy everything it has to offer. Although it gets busy at certain times there are plenty of areas that are quieter, and the displays are so well put together you will find it hard not to stand and take it all in. The light show ends the day perfectly but get there early if you want a seat or prime spot."
"Flower Dome is dressing up for Christmas! Lots of thoughtfulness and efforts in creating the right atmosphere for the most wonderful time of the year! The reindeers are here, except Rudolf!"
Went with my daughter n 2 nieces. The autonomous vehicle was in operation and they charge a $5 fee. Would be good if they allow seniors free ride while on trial run. The flowers were so beautiful beyond description. As it was raining at cloud forest was very cold. The pitcher flower is so attractive. No wonder the insects fall victim to them. Its amazing that in Singapore without caves we can see stalagmites and stalagmites. We can also see huge and beautiful cacti in the gardens. One feels calm n relax after all the beautiful sights.
The gardens are an exceptional piece of engineering and it quite spectacular to see. Not all parts of the gardens are thriving and I would expect there may be some strategic improvements over time. The light show and treetop walk are excellent.
"Gardens by the Bay comprises Flower and Cloud Domes, Super Trees and the surrounding cultural outdoor garden. The flower gardens are a horticulturists dream, however was somewhat a disappointment for me as the representative garden of my country, South Africa in the Flower Dome was a poor reflection of a South African garden.The Cloud Dome however was more than made up for the disappointment in terms of concept and education.To properly experience all that these gardens and surrounding, requires between you need 6 to 8 hours. Plan to start latest 10am, wear good walking shoes as there is lots of ground to cover and along a sun hat or umbrella for sun protection.Take the paid tour around the garden to orient yourself and plan your next steps. The Gardens is more than just the Super Trees and the Domes. Make sure you stay to experience the 8pm light show. The gardens at night is a sight to behold."
Lovely and unusal attraction. Would advise to give yourself plenty of time for your visit. There is much room for improvement as regards information and communication regarding tickets and last entry times. Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are sold as a combined ticket but the entrances are separate and if you come at night you may have to forefit one of these attractions as the last entry is at 8pm for both of these. There were multiple groups in this position when we arrived. Eventually a helpful staff member said we actually could enter up to 8.20pm which did allow us to do both.
"Its best to visit this place in night... Crowd is there but you cant miss it ... So ""must visit"".. Also the viewing deck gaves excellent shots to phographers."
"It's one of those places you need to go when you're in Singapore. I can't say i've spent a huge amount of time there, the first time we went when we had just arrived in Singapore but we've obviously been numerous times with friends and relatives when they've come to visit. Go for a wander and then grab a drink at MBS after!"
"Due to the hot weather in Singapore, the place can be very hot to move around during the daytime. More covered walkways need to built to provide shade. More trees too."
The Gardens are exotic & very beautifully maintained. Everything is climate controlled & looks amazing.
A unique visit. Surprised how much I enjoyed this whole area. It is also air conditioned so it was an oasis from the heat.
"I visited the Gardens by the Bay last week. I strongly recommend you visit the Flower Dome and Cloud Dome in the evening time as it is more atmospheric. Be in the Cloud Dome by 2000hrs (8PM) as this is the last misting of the day, with the darkest and the mist makes it really a special visit. If you are frighten of heights would not recommend going all the way up to the seventh floor and walking out on the sky bridge. By the time you have completed your visit to the Domes you will be ready for the light show in the Super Tree Grove which commences at 2045hrs (8.45PM) another great event, the lights and music are very well matched."
"This was the top attraction in SG, so i think its a must. Although, I think its on the expensive side, but I think the entrance fee is due to the technologically advance garden and the upkeep of all the exotic plants, so cost is justified. But as I was walking around, I was suddenly reminded by the Kew Garden. If you cannot go to London, this is I think the next best thing. I loved the cactus exhibits and the ballerina flower. Both are perfect for photography."
The Garden by the bay is located near by the singapores most famous iconic marina bay sands. This place could be accessed through the MRT. Located beautifully with a combination of many gardens we really enjoyed the view of the super grove and visiting the cloud forest and flower dome. However this place do get crowded towards the evening and its advisable to arrive early.
This was a very pleasant way to spend an afternoon. The ride is actually two rides so be sure to enjoy both. Have a Singapore Sling at the top and take in the panoramic view. Easy to reach on the MRT and just a short walk from the station.
Loved the place. Great for an outing with family. Great for those taking pictures and def go at night for the best view
"This is a good place to stroll and have a leisure walk countering the hot and sunny Singapore weather.This is best enjoyed during a sunny weather as the dome is shielded with special ventilation that reduces the harsh rays of sunlight plus the whole dome is air-conditioned - giving you a cool, highlands atmosphere.I recommend this for families or big groups who has senior citizens in their group, or for people who prefers light walks, lots of pretty photo ops and relaxed vibes."
"Being an artificially constructed garden, it has that feel throughout of course. But that said, it has an enormous collection and so e very interesting structures with water etc. Very pleasant and nice for youngsters too."
We went there at dusk about 7pm. We saw all the lighted solar trees against the dark skies with the marina bay sands as a plus. The sky park was closed because of some lightning. It had just rained around sentosa island. It was quite a view. As we were leaving the lights on the supertrees began changing colors so we stayed for a while to watch and take photos. It was worth the rush from USS to this.
"This was our first visit to the Gardens by the Bay. We felt it was reasonably priced and very well organised. Crowds were not too large and we had a great day. We bought the Attraction Bundle (see website) which gave us access to the Flower dome, Floral Fantasy and the Cloud Forest (my personal favourite). I think this will become like the Long Bar at Raffles - no trip to Singapore will be complete without having visited it"
"There isn't much to dislike about Gardens by the Bay. It's free to walk around the expansive grounds and take in some pretty immaculate landscape architecture.I would highly recommend getting the 2 conservatory pass and seeing Cloud Forest and flower dome. Cloud forest looks like something out of Avatar, it's awesome.The super tree light show it's ok, although I expected more. If you are already there then hang around for it, don't make a dedicated trip just for that though.Great day out and lots to see"
Cloud forest was amazingly interesting. The flowers at the flower dome were attracting wish the bears; theme for the period can be allowed for us to take pic with. Coz they were too cute.
We only saw it at night so cant really say much about the gardens but the light show is amazing. Food options are limited to either fast food in a food court or fine dining but vietnamese was tasty although basic surroundings.
"We went and had a great half day here. Unfortunately, the forest dome was closed for maintenance and only the flower dome was open otherwise we might have spent longer there. Worth checking on the website before you go if anything is closed!!Nice to walk around the outside spaces as well though."
This wasn't my cup of tea but still giving it 4 stars because I can still appreciate the effort that goes into creating these gardens. We went here because we had time to kill before a 1 am flight and it was a good use of time to see the 8 pm lights since by that time museums and stuff are closed. It is something to do if you have the extra time but don't think it is a must do if you can't fit it in.
The place is nice to visit both during day and night. The theme for the plants and flowers are all insta worthy.
Never fail to deliver the awesome experience...always good to brings friends who enjoy nature. Never fail to impress them.
Nice place with beautiful view. Travelling to Gardens by the Bay is more convenient by MRT and buses.
We came to the gardens at night time. All the paid attractions were closed but we still got to see the gardens and the trees. Absolutely stunning and was nice and quiet.
"Was very impressed with this. Only $28 to get in which I thought was very reasonable. Amazing gardens , all the beautiful flowers were out in full bloom. Amazing colours and sections with different plants from different parts of the world. You could spend a lot of time here just getting lost amongst nature."
Must be visited when you stay in SingaporeSo many type of greens.Organised very well with a lot of explanations
"We like very much the place, many flowers, plants and trees from every places in the word. Price is expensive"
"Definitely worth seeing. Wear comfortable shoes and bring an umbrella in case it rains. There are LOTS of different places to walk, but if you can't do that level of walking there is a shuttle cart to help ease the load on your legs also. I visited the Cloud Dome and really loved it. Didn't get a chance to do the Flower Dome, nor did I get to walk in the giant trees. But note the Cloud Dome is air conditioned and pretty cool - so if its a hot day, this is a great option! There is an abundance of natural beauty alongside some man-made wonders as well (like the tallest indoor waterfall). Definitely a must-see if in Singapore."
An absolutely stunning garden. The synchronized light show in the evenings is a must see. The tour to the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome is spectacular. This is definitely a mist visit when going to Singapore
"The Floral Fantasy (FF) is awesome. However, FF is small walk for like 10 minutes and then finish. It's suit for photoshoot session."
"This is my first time visiting here, while my friends had came a dozen times aredi! A very popular tourist attractions place, with two domes sheltered housing all these flowers species in a cool zone! I find the high held bridges interesting n excited, cos u can see tru below, one might get nervous of height, overall a fun fill outing n if u love flowers!"
We enjoyed wandering about the gardens in the cool dome. This time we didn't go to see the light show but have previously and it is fab.
"I have visited Gardens by the Bay about 4 times during the last few years that I have visited Singapore. The Gardens are free to the public, and easy to approach by public transport (MRT train and Bus), either to the main Gate or to the ""Canopy"", which is a central Meeting point inside the Gardens. It is well laid out, and you can take an electric buggy ride through the gardens. There are also 2 large cooled covered enclosures, the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, besides the OCBC (walking) Skyway, all 3 with ticketed entry. There is also a free open air ""Sound and Light Show"" at nights. I have seen 2 special shows in the Flower Dome, the Tulips Show and the Cherry Blossom Show, which were exquisite and most colourful. Normally, there are seasonal shows here every year. This is a must visit location, not far from the main attractions in the city, for all visitors to Singapore.."
"Like everyone else visiting Singapore, this is definitely a place to see.Great vibe, great light show in the super tree groveLovely place to walk around and a great food court"
"The best time is to visit is at night to enjoy the lit up Supertrees, the Gardens, Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Savour the culinary delights at Satay by the Bay. Then take a stroll to the Marina Barrage for unobstructed views of the city skyline."
"Nice attraction. Well-designed but not cheap. While I agree with recommendations to go late afternoon to catch the light show when it gets dark (7:45 pm for 1st show), make sure you provide enough daylight time if you wish to go to the two main gardens. We ended up in the floral garden and it was too dark to appreciate it as they keep the lighting quite dim. We went on a Saturday and it was extremely crowded. It was designed to push the crowds through so it wasn't a long wait but it distracts from the nature appreciation aspects.The most disconcerting part are the massive bottlenecks along two narrow staircase on the path to get back to the Bayside MRT Station when everyone leaves after the light show. While the crowd during my visit was relatively well disciplined, it is a disaster waiting to happen if anything unusual occurs. The massive sway in the pedestrian bridge with a huge crowd was not the most pleasant. I am surprised these were not taken into account in the design."
I go there at mid-autumn festival .There got a lot of light and lantern are display.I go with my friends and take a lot of photo there for memory. :)
"It was a fun day at the Gardens at the Bay as the sun was out and the air was fresh. For people that is afraid of heights, you may need someone to hold your hand just in case you feel dizzy walking among the supertrees."
"Well worth coming here, if you can make it on dusk all the better and stay through to see the light show once its dark.Bit of a walk from the MRT station and also around the gardens. There is an inexpensive shuttle."
"One of the highlights of Singapore, Gardens by the Bay is beautifully made area, with the main attractions being the Cloud Forest and Flower Domes and the Supergrove trees. The light and sound show at the supegrove trees is a must watch, at 7:45pm and 8:45pm everyday!!"
"My wife wanted to go to the place with the tall electronic trees which is Gardens by the Bay. We took Grab over to the place with no issues getting there.We got there in the knick of time for busloads of school kids and tourists that follow a flag came just after we arrived.We paid the admission to see the gardens. Absolutely spectacular. Lots of different fauna, trees, etc from countries around the world. It was great seeing stuff from South Africa, New Zealand and other countries I had been to years ago.My wife went picture taking like crazy. It is inside a very large dome and is air conditioned.I whole hardheartedly suggest seeing it"
It was a nice visit/walk. good organization and efforts to offer the visits a nice 'green' area with the corresponding information to the plants and trees. It was not what I expected but if you are in Singapore then at least do not miss the light night show and the skyline walk!
"What an amazing place! And a great place to escape the heat. The cloud garden was our favorite, what an amazing design and loved the different levels and plants. The flower garden was nice but very busy. The tree top walkway was excellent... we went there mid day and almost had the whole walkway to ourselves. Incredible views! I understand that in the evenings you have to queue for long periods of time....fyi"
Gardens by the Bay is great daytime and especially in the evening when you can look at the famous light show. It's at 7.45 PM and it's free. Should you wish to go into the domes to look at flowers and plants you'll need a ticket.
This garden is beautiful with a lot of flowers. Interesting information about the flowers and they have a eating area.
Had a couple of hours walk around here and really enjoyed it. did the sky walk the cloud forest and stayed for the music/light show. unusual but glad we did it.
"Easy to reach via Metro, nice gardens to relax in during the day. Indoor domes are a must although there is an entry fee, unlike the gardens.In all places, it was easy to access for strollers and the kids will find it very exciting.In the evening it gets very busy before the light show starts, so if you have young kids get there early to secure a good place. After the light show, the lifts are very busy so it will take time getting out with a stroller."
"If you are going at night, you can easily get lost as the garden is not very well lit. But they do have really nice view and it is nearby the Marina Bay Sands hotel."
"This is one of the places, which quite a few people visiting Singapore do not really know about. There are some lit up Avatar trees with a musical light show and is free of cost, which can be appreciated by watching the show by lying on the ground, literally by sleeping on the ground. One should experience this and then go watch the fountain and laser show besides, on the bay front, about 15 min walk from there. There are a couple of in house gardens for which the tickets need to be bought."
Stunning place to visit. Saw at several times of the day and spent many hours there and still didn't see it all
"I have been to Gardens by the Bay both during the daytime and at night and I must say, I prefer to be there at night. It is prettier as it is all lit up and also way cooler if you want to be wandering around. Do be prepared for the crowds. we Grab there and just to get in took us a good 15 minutes as it was packed. Mind you, it was on a Saturday night. Once you are in there, it is easy. The shows wee fabulous and if possible, I do recommend trying to catch it at least once."
"This is a large park set on ""reclaimed land"", which contains a series of themed gardens from various countries. It also contains two 'biodomes' and the ""Giant Tree Grove"". The gardens themselves can be enjoyed without paying an entrance fee and make for a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of Singapore City. The gardens are very natural, with evidence of local wildlife starting to take advantage of this relatively new environment. These gardens also offer good views of Singapore City and ""Marina Bay""."
"Stunning, amazing and beautiful manmade flora and fauna gardens.Definitely will come again with family.Hope management will consider to built moderate eco freindly prayer room for muslim tourists in the future."
"The gardens themselves (without paying to go inside the domes) was spectacular in itself, but we still did go into Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. There's a 3rd, but we only wanted to do 2 of them and was told that if we only picked 2, it was these 2 that we could only do (I assume because the 3rd dome was further out). You can pick all 3 in a package which comes with a free ride on the golf buggy.We got there nice and early on a Monday and had breakfast there, before starting out. We did Cloud Forest first and found the dome nice and quiet - only a handful of other visitors. The place is so big, you don't really get in each other's way anyway. Bear in mind that the domes are climate controlled and it was very cool in both of them. The Cloud Forest begins with a misty waterfall, before you walk around and head up to the overhead walkway. The views around the gardens and outside through the dome windows were really cool. With the 2 kids, it took us about 40 minutes to complete the dome.Flower dome is located next to Cloud forest and when we entered about 10.30, it was very busy. The dome is broken up into different regions of the world and is very colourful, but I didn't find it as fun as I'm not a green thumb. There were plenty of colourful photo opportunities, but as it was very busy, it was a case of waiting for your turn, or waiting for the crowd to stop walking through.The park and the domes are very wheelchair and pram friendly - we didn't have a stroller, but noticed all the ramp and elevator options.Once we were done, we left by walking to the MRT station. It takes about 10 minutes (adult walk) and you get to walk through those gigantic trees you can see from afar. There's also a great opportunity to take photos of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Singapore Flyer."
Gardens By The Bay is a fantastic way to soak in the cool crisp air in the evenings for either a good relaxing run or slow stroll. You may spot some otters!
"Want to get outside, aimlessly wander and see some impressive designs and gardens, then it doesn't get more interesting than this place."
It's a very nice area to view lots and lots of different plants to see. A couple of levels in this place and it is nicely air conditioned so worth a visit in the hot Singapore Air.
"We attended a talk hosted by Martin Brundle, it was held at the gardens, so after we could wander around and discover the gardens"
Nice time to spend quite evening with lots of good food choices to pick from. Place is well connected to other parts of Singapore.
"Two different experiences. By day you can enjoy wandering the gardens looking at the natural plants, by night you can enjoy the man made giant flower light and music show.CAUTION: - the beverages in the bar are not as good value as other places you can find in Singapore.."
The Gardens are a testament to Singapore's imagination. Great family day out. There are a number of attractions in side the Gardens that will appeal to all types.
The current exhibition on RHODODENDRON really amazes me how many colors and variants there are.The setup is really beautiful and many just can't stop taking photos with the floral displays.Suitable for all ages in both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome.Don't forget the evening lights display!
"Very well layd out. The artificial trees with light shows were a bit disney like, but nice anyway, also for children"
"Visited the Cloud Garden and it was great value for money, enjoyed the displays. Pricey for all three but plan for day and night to get best value. Station for train is closest, don't do the Marina, too far to walk."
For sure a nice visit and something you can spare some time for. You are probably going to be in the area anyway. Cloud Forest was impressive for me and so was the lightshow in the evening.
"Spent the morning here walking around the domes and gardens, not sure if it was because it was the morning but very quite.I wouldn't allocate any more than half a day but nice peaceful experience."
A very well designed place for evening luxury. There are two parts of this place. Flower dome and cloud forest. One needs to enter and walk around this both places. Scenic beauty is very well planned and excellently designed. Kudos to the entire team for managing it flawlessly.My advice: Plan to go there by late afternoon and then finish the two domes by evening 7:00 p.m.. later please take the OCBC skywalk from 7 to 7:45 pm. Evening musical Rendevous will start from 7.45 till 8:15. One can just relax in the lawns beside and see the beautiful music and light show.
A well manicured location which helps us to educate our children about nature n its bounties! It also draws them to the forgotten n not so fearful habitat that existed or exists
"Beautiful, we did go on a Sunday so it was a busy family day and there were queues to enter the domes. The work that goes into developing and maintaining this park must be endless,but worth it"
Nice walkthrough to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Casino. Tastfully arranged as almost everything in Singapore
"Of the two domes, I was most looking forward to the cloud forest. However, although beautiful and well laid out, we were a bit disappointed that everything seemed to be in pots rather than growing naturally in the biosphere. The Mediterranean dome was more natural and as a result felt more impressive. All in all, it was worth the trip.As a side note, take a jumper or cardigan for inside. After the Singapore heat, I was freezing making my way around."
"We bought tickets for both the cloud forest and flower dome. I honestly love the cloud forest more cause the flower dome was just a bunch of flowers maybe it would be fascinating to a flower enthusiast but I enjoyed the cloud forest more. The indoor waterfall was spectacular!The facilities are equipped for the less agile and wheelchairs.Shuttles are provided for those who do not want to walk from the main entrance to the two domes(for SGD3/person)But if you are capable, I would suggest you to take a stroll in the garden, its amazing and there are a few pretty interesting sculptures."
"Came here at 5 p.m, and wait till 8 p.m for the show, it was wonderful, the place was packed with tourist who wanted to watch the tree light show, I believe the show was 15 minute, the lights were so pretty, it was lantern festival so the lights were so many."
Gardens by the bay is stunning - we spent hours here just relaxing and enjoying the amazing architecture and the way that the flowers have been crafted and displayed. I've been here twice and will be coming back again!
"Great value for money, and well worth the visit. Make sure you do the treetop walk and also the Cloud. Amazing. The place is absolutely spotless."
"Well the open air gardens are free whilst charges to enter the domes are reasonable. We have been before and enjoyed it a lot both times. Currently (September 2019) some areas are under redevelopment so there is a little less to enjoy than previously, however the gardens are so big they will still entertain and inform you for a long while. Don't miss them if you are in Singapore."
"Next to the fact that is beautiful to visit, it is rather educational on how large cities can try to be sustainable. Did not fact check any of this, but seems to make sense."
"I debated giving this an excellent rating, because it really is quite amazing. Perhaps the only negative thing I can say is that there were so many people, it slightly detracted from the experience. Well worth going. I thought it was slightly better than the cloud forest (although I also gave that a very good rating)."
"These gardens are well laid out, with easy paths to follow, with various bits of sculpture to enjoy. Various sections dedicated to specific types of plants. there is a small lake . Not forgetting the tree sculptures. These gardens are free to walk around, however you pay for the walk way above over the tree sculptures. Nice way to have a relaxed couple of hours."
Suggest you go early at 9am so that no one photo bombs your family photos or selfies.The Rhododendron Radiance floral show is on until 28 October. Be prepared to spend at least 45 minutes in this floral show.Suggest you wait until around June or July every year when you can buy the Friends of Gardens by the Bay membership at half price during their membership promotion period. Right now a 2 year senior citizen membership can be bought for the price of 1 year's membership. See the website for details on how long this promotion is on until.The Food Court is worth a visit as it has a nice ambiance and a good place to chat with friends over coffee but it is a distance to walk. And food prices are more expensive than other food courts.
Unique Garden with two Aircon Dome. Cooling whilst you enjoy Landscape and Seasoning Flower. Recommended to go in late afternoon and leave after dark as different view
The Gardens are certainly different and not just for plant lovers!! Quirky installations and a nice walk from the Marina Bay precinct
"On arrival we discovered that the floral dome was closed. It was one of the reasons for our visit but we walked around the outside of the gardens instead of going into any of the domes. It is stunning and worth a visit. Plenty to see and experience outside of the domes. Really lovely experience. Went in the day but apparently beautiful at night with all the lights, Would recommend and next time will go into the domes."
View is nice and very convenient as they do provide chargeable shuttle services (unlimited rides) around the Garden. My family love the walk around and the garden is clean.
Catch the green hop on hop of bus right to the gardens entrance. The flower and cloud done are sensational and a must see. Pay the extra. Stay for the night lights they are magical
"good place for families and elder. they provide good access for disable and elder.flower dome and cloud forest is a good place for relaxing. but beware of seasons, because when we coming there, there is a little flowers blooming.garden rhapsody is a must. just enjoy the music and look at a lights dancing"
"Packed, but lovely. The light show is at 7.45 for fifteen minutes, with sound. Queues for the high bridge were crazy, with one for paying and booking a slot in time, about 30 minutes, the a second to use the slot, which was running behind. So you may spend an hour in queues if you are unlucky. Be prepared. Otherwise entry is free, good choice of food outlets. Clean and organised."
"Overall experience was good as it was very cooling inside the dome. Probably the weather outside was pretty humid. Took photos of the lovely flowers and exhibits. The shuttle to & fro is kinda ex thou. As couples, we would rather walk through and enjoy the breeze. I would suggest if Gardens by the Bay can come out with ideas on the shuttle & ticket packages for locals. Nevertheless, it was awesome weekend for us!"
Well worth a vist to this place there are many plants from all over the world. Access to the areas within the garden is good.
It's a really cool place to walk around and read if you have a long layover. There are nice shadows and lots of greenery around.But if you plan to visit all the attractions around prepare your wallet because are quite expensive!
"You can visit here at night or day, both times have a different feeling. In the night they have light shows and in the early morning its looks like just tall trees of Avtar movie."
"I would recommend a night visit to get the full effect, at 20.45hrs there is a light and music show, which lasts 15 mins and worth a watch"
It's a beautiful placeï¼Especially the waterfall was great.I got a postcard when I showed a map that was distributed free of charge at the airport.ã¨ã£ã¦ãã¹ãã­ãªå ´æã§ãããç¹ã«æ»ãè¯ãããã¤ãã¹ã¤ãªã³ãæµ´ã³ã¦ãªãã¬ãã·ã¥ã§ãã¾ãããç©ºæ¸¯ã§ç¡æã§è²°ãããããã«ã¯ã¼ãã³ãã¤ãã¦ããã®ã§ããã±ãããã¼ã¹ã§è¦ããã¨ããããã¹ãã«ã¼ããããã ãã¾ããã
Our tour included the option of the cloud visit or the gardens by the bay dome. Our guide said the waterfall at Singapore Airport was better than that in the cloud dome and unless you were interested in climate change the more 'Instagram friendly pics' would be in the gardens dome. Needless to say I think most of the tour party opted for the garden option.The subtle and elegant lighting made it look like a wonderful fairy grotto but in all honesty if you really want to see the Flora I think a day time well lit option might be better. That said the advantage of the evening if the wonderful light show outside to music. The treetop walk amongst the structures looked very exciting and would be great for photos so one to explore for a return trip I think
Another (physically) cool place to visit. Interesting flora from around world with some new learning points. It must take the caretakers an enormous effort for the upkeep- kudos for them - and don't touch the plants - ok ?
Amazing place with man-made lighting trees. Beautiful light & sound in the evening. Great place to visit.
"Enjoyed a walk around these iconic gardens, as a antidote to the concrete jungle of downtown, great for a casual and hardcore garden fans alike"
"The Super Trees are there, and a light show occurs in that area at 7:45 pm. For the attractions tickets if you have a Singapore airlines reservation coming up, and can show proof, and if you are a senior citizen, and bring your passport to show proof of age, you can get discounts on the tickets."
"This attraction has great views, plants and statues! Although a little expensive to get into each dome!"
"Stunning architectural 'supertrees' with a 'treetop' walkway between some ($8). Lovely garden around, although we preferred the Singapore Botanic Garden. Plenty of food options available, plus you get a good view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel."
"Lovely gardens by the bay, with green entry, excellent paths, clear signage and great views. You need to pay to do the high level walk $8, but worth it for the perspective and $23 for the two domes (also very worthwhile), but the basic garden entry is free and I really enjoyed it."
"If you have a few hours free, you really shoud visit the flower and cloud domes at gardens by the bay. They are very special"
Like most things in Singapore the gardens are well worth a visitLocated right behind the Marina Bay Sands one can spend hours exploring these wonderful gardens. Not to be missed
It was amazing place.. Its painted very well & variety of flowers are very good.. there is 2 dome.. Flower & rain forest.. flower dome is very very nice.. i never see this type of things any other place.. they have maintenance day 1 day in a month.. so please check the day before book ticket.. night show is also good..
Very well done and worth the visit. Reminded me of the Eden Project. Be prepared for an information ocerload.
"A very hot day forecast so we went here to see the orchids and other features in the morning. It was fantastic, colour everywhere, wooden sculptures, a real credit to those who set up the Gardens by the Bay. The cloud forest, while not as eye catching, was also enjoyable. We returned to Singapore city via the MRT, easy to use and were very pleased we had visited.."
Really beautiful place and I enjoyed the experience very much as a guest of the event. Guests could come earlier and enjoy the flower garden before the event too!
Beautiful garden. Its breath taking. Just a little pricey to go in the domes. The garden is family friendly. Its a must to visit.
We have been before but not at night so just wanted to see the trees lit up .they didnt dissapoint and glad we took the time to do this
Im so amazed with the beauty of the place. Its very unusual to me coz firs time i visited inside the garden. Just saw it outside. The view so relaxing and i cant feel thatim bore. So lovely flowers i saw and experience those.
"The evening show was very enjoyable, this garden is free to enter though there is a charge for the sky-walk (I did not do) some may find it cheesy but chill and enjoy......"
we wanted to see tropical plants and we saw tons. but the weather was super hot. thankfully they have AC haha
A great place to visit.Im glad I visited... but it was very crowded and overall not that exciting.Good place to tick off the list....
"Just a short walk from the new bayside mrt station. All sorts of plants, sights, and close to Marina Bay Sands and many other attractions."
"Impressive show of lights in complimentary setting.Everyone there enjoyed the music and colorful lights on the artificially framed trees and plants. It's worth the visit but bring some mats to lie on. Being near the sea, it helped that the air was breezy and comfortable."
"We were fortunate enough to stay at the Marina Bay Hotel which is connected by a walkway to the gardens by the bay. Because it was very hot and humid we decided to take an early morning walk to the gardens. We had arrived before the ticket office opened so we just strolled through the Gardens public areas. The areas were extremely clean and well manicured, but it got very hot quickly and we returned to the hotel. We were able to see the light show from our room which is not to be missed. It's probably even better in person. This is one of those Singapore attractions that I would not miss."
I always went there for a morning walks while I was in Singapore. It is nice and quiet. Good varieties of flowers and plants that are indigenous to South East Asia.
"Today I visited Gardens by The Bay for the1st time. The garden is huge & colourful. I booked a ticket for an Audio Tour, a 20-minute tram ride around the outdoors accompanied by informative audio commentary for a full cruising around. The next step is to enjoy the Flower Dome + Cloud Forest with FREE timing. The Supertrees are the first things you will notice when approaching the Gardens. Unfortunately, the OCBC Skyway was closed for maintenance. The Flower Dome was less than what I expected, I could say that the Green Planet in Dubai is far more exciting to see (although smaller) and many comments say that the Botanical gardens of Singapore are more beautiful (I will visit this week). I seem to enjoy the Cloud Forest more; I loved the waterfall, the cooling atmosphere, and being on top of the mountain. You will find SentSational Orchids (event) until 22 September in Cloud Forest, It is a small area though. I will visit the latest attraction at the gardens, Floral Fantasy this week.SEE photos."
"Pretty good, not great. Then again, I had just came from the Botanical Gardens and the National Orchid Garden.A bit like comparing apples and oranges, however, still relevant. Free entry into the Botanical Gardens and $5 for the National Orchid Garden. Therefore, some of the costs of the attractions at The Bay, by comparison - seemed expensive.The cactus garden was nice and was free, however, I was a bit disappointed by the cost of other attractions.Nevertheless, it was still pretty good."
Gardens by the Bay are beautiful. But it is very touristy and a bit artificial. If you like nature combined with a little plastic and bling-bling. This is the place.
"When visiting gardens by the bay, which is certainly worthwhile, avoid the foodcourt! Unfriendly and expensive!"
"Had a lovely time here. Was expecting to be disappointed, but for an engineered and somewhat expensive (cloud forest was great, flower room was OK) attraction, it was rather good fun. Easy to get to and navigate - nice way to cool down from the heat."
"Was beautiful. However, the indoor flower dome air-conditioning seems not as cooling. Would visit again thou"
It's amazing how much of this space you can see for free. Easiest to access from the hotel and walk across the walkway. Lots of shade and flat walkways so easy access. Water fountains are dotted around too.
This place is adjacent to Marina Bay Tower and readily accessible. It is an enclosed area with air-conditioning system teeming with so many plants and faunas. We enjoyed taking pictures of the beautiful flowers and various unfamiliar plants. We also enjoyed the short movie featuring some animations and the amazing scenery inside the gardens.
"The Gardens by the Bay is a very popular visitors' park for both locals, residents and tourists. The whole gardens' wide variety of living flora are all housed within fully climate controlled dome housing. Plants and flowers from around the way are beautifully displayed. We can enjoy seeing many temperate varieties, although we are located at the equator. Simply amazing. Take many photos and memories back Home to share with family and friends."
One of the best gardens with so many species of flowers and plants! It's brilliant and colorful. Do not hurry this place. You will have to absorb this place with good amount of time as there is so much to see !
A short stroll through the Gardens. A must visit location if you come to Singapore. Best time to visit is at dusk.
Visit here from 4-8pm to get glimpse of light and dark designing.spare 3-4 hrs so that you dont miss anything. It has 3-4 attractions inside. One of them is closed on different days. Plan your visit accordingly. Watched the light show here. Free of cost . Different and eye catching.
Cooling and beautifully done place. The cloud forest is something to look forward to. Beautifully done and maintained. 100's of flowers to explore. Something to include in your trip to Singapore.
"since they have different flower in different event, it's always fun to go there and even more because a lot of flower can't grow in singapore weather."
"Been to the Gardens By The Bay twice in past two weeks. The display in flower dome is constantly refreshed to a certain theme, cloud forest is still amazing albeit the strong crowd and a bit of human jam going up the escalator. However, the staff was quick to divert the crowd to nearby elevator etc."
"We visited the garden in August and it is something you need to do while in Singapore. The cost is $28 Singapore each, I felt this was a bit pricing for what it was, we then had to pay extra to go up the OCBC Skyway. The two domes are flower dome and cloud forest and the waterfall is a highlight, it is very well air conditioned and can get a little cold which is a nice change from the heat outside. If you like orchards as I do then I would recommend a visit as I have never seen so many varieties on display."
"A very pleasant place to visit with families member. Flowers, waterfall and many others attractive trees and features.Educational for my children too knowing about the trees and flowers."
"We did the tree top walk and visited the flower dome. The tree top walk is short but the views of the gardens, the city and the bay are all worth it. The flower dome is definitely a must visit for flora lovers however it's quite expensive - $20 a head for adults."
"This whole area is beautiful, you don't have to pay just to walk around but you have to pay to visit the flower dome or the cloud forest but unfortunately the cloud forest was closed that day so we visited the flower dome. Beautiful"
"Beautiful place, but the show was too late (around 9pm) my baby just fell asleep right before the light n music show begin. So i have to go back to the hotel."
Went here with my mom and dad. The place is very well kept and the structure and layouts are very unique. I did find the entry pricing for what you see a bit expensive.Both my parents need wheelchair support. This entire facility is not very assistance friendly. We waited about 20 mins to get to the 7th floor lost world in the cloud forest.
Interesting if you have knowledge! But otherwize it's just something you do to pass your time in Singapour has there is not that much to do or see...
"Take the time to stroll around this garden. They really are a delight with lots of plants, designs and sculptures to look at. The waterfall is beautiful. Easy access and great for all ages."
"Very busy but very nice to walk around. Satay by the bay, next door, is great for a cheap lunch. The kids really liked cloud forest. Reasonably priced."
"This is a very relaxing experience. Lots of plants including trees divided into sections according to habitat. Wooden sculptures compliment the displays. However, it is extremely busy at the weekends though and there will be another long queue if you have decided to visit the cloud forest too."
"Well worth a visit, beautiful gardens, night time light show was amazing! Very busy though so please get there early!"
"The cloud dome and light show both were amazing , the flower dome was so colourful, kids enjoyed this place alot , the only pinch was the waiting time for going to the top of the waterfall in cloud dome but it was worth waiting , walking down the beautiful waterfall is worth it . And after long walk around the garden and in the domes, I grabbed corner in the garden and enjoyed the night show which was very relaxing and amazing."
This place is HUGE. My partner and I visited the Gardens and more specifically the top attractions such as the Sky Walk and Cloud Dome which both have an entrance fee (Sky Walk $8 per adult SGD and Cloud Dome $20 per adult SGD). You could spend hours here but the heat and humidity made it hard to explore the whole Gardens. The Cloud Dome provided relief as this attraction was airconditioned and we spent about 2 hours there alone.
"Most of the people who come to this place are first time visitors, and many have limited time. The signages to the various sites need to be more numerous and prominently visible."
The tree structures are fascinating. The light show was a bit too twee. There was a queue to get up to the walk way.
Nature (man made) at its best. Kingdom of garden artistry that educate visitors of the various plants. U'll love the scenery especially at night. Enjoy the view as you stroll along or just sit back and enjoy . A fee is require in some of the sight seeing in the area.
"Lovely views and every plant you can imagine just be prepared for walking soo much, I recommend you go here at least once."
"The First Time i go to this place at afternoon, but this time i get best view from this place because i go at night and if you go around 7.00 PM - 09.00 PM you can enjoy music show at Giant Tree"
"A must visit for garden lovers, all gardens were very neat, was really a safe haven in the heat of singaporeKl**k had made it easy for us to get thereNeed to put more signage for directions in the venues"
"Huge array of plants, flowers and trees.. The domes are nice but very crowded and I found that quite trying especially the number of people blocking walkways taking forever to take photos. The wooden sculptures inside were amazing. The outside part (which is free) is actually nicer (although v humid with some wierd sculptures).. It is worth a visit and does have some amazing views of the bay."
"Must see Gardens by the Bay, indoor plants of thousands of varieties when in Singapore, Both flowers , bonsai and full grown trees best time to visit at dawn"
"This is a very wounded place. The design of the park has a feeling of the future world. Two giant greenhouses put the whole forest into it, as if it were human habitation on Mars."
Went in the evening as the crowds were leaving. Lovely light shows in the cooler part of the day. Well worth visiting with beautiful plantings. A gem for local families. We timed it to walk over to see the Marina Bay Sands light show daily at 8or 9pm.
"I just walking around to the garden after walking at Marina Bay Sands. The distance is about 800 metres from Marina Bay Sands. Amazing light show at 8 pm and nice for relaxing your feet after walking around the city,"
"Beautiful gardens to enjoy with children , spend the day and learn flowers, plants and most amazing natural trees. A must cost please when in Singapore. Dress for extremely warm environment and humid"
"We had a great day at Gardens by the Bay. It is worth sending some hours in both of the huge greenhouses - ""Flower Dome"" and ""Cloud forest"" which have an amazing variety of plants and are also air-conditioned. We went at at ime of an orchid festival which had amazing displays. There is much else to explore and it is essential to be there in the evening for the light and sound display in Supertree Grove. There are good restaurants although we found the outdoor food-court style of Satay by the Bay humid and with noisy music. We enjoyed a morning coffee in the Fennel cafe but it was closed when we went to get some tea in the afternoon. One disappointment for New Zealanders was that, despite attempts to represent most world environments, there appeared to be no acknowledgement of NZ's unique flora and several presentations of world maps even left off NZ completely."
"Go to the first skytrees in the beginning for some close up foto's, but make sure to proceed to the park of trees for the lighshow. That is fun to see and witness. Stay on the ground to see most of it. If on the skybridge you risk the possibility to be herded like cattle by the staff..."
A nice place to bring family for a leisurely walk and be impressed by the display and the vision of the engineers who created this visual spectacle.
Definitely enjoyed this. I thought the Cloud Forest was more interesting for the average person. But those who really know their plants would get a lot out of the Flowerdome too
We went there in the night and it was absolutely beautiful. Plenty to see and do and a nice walk on the water. We found it very crowded though especially when people were going to the light show at the end of the night.
"Gardens by the Bay-Singapore:- Worth to see, especially OCBC Garden Rhapsody and super trees- Some places are free to visit, some you must pay"
You must going to it if you are in singapore in my opinion 1st attraction in singapore must doing it it free and there was cloud and flower tickets price 21$
A colourful garden of trees and flowers all over the world that can offer visitors wonderful pictures!
Excellant place to visit when visiting Singapore would recommend to visitGardens by the bay no problems
I attended the ND concert this year on Saturday which was located in Gardens By the Bay. The venue was busy and free to enter with some local singers and comedians on the stage. The food stalls were goo too. The Gardens themselves are great to walk in when it is not too hot or humid.
"When visited the gardens we pre booked our tickets to save the hassle of lining up to get in.The cloud garden was our favourite but all round it's an amazing place.We visited late afternoon when it was cooler.Very crowded though,the line for the sky walk was 5 deep and Long so we gave that a miss .The day we went was Thursday,our taxi driver said it would be twice as crowded on Friday,Sat and Sunday.Hard to imagine but certainly worth visiting ."
Visit the garden by the bay it is one of the best gardens.You cold take snaps with flower dome and could see a cloud dome it is a good place to watch and children like it very much
"This was a new addition to Singapore since my last visit. Their daily evening light show was very enjoyable, with superb backdrop of the Marina Bay Sands. The only thing they could do with improving on is the music that accompanies the show."
"Nice tourist spot with beautiful displays of nature. Several portions are included for a days visit; you should set aside one day to visit the main attractions. During my visit, there was an additional flower attraction which was not really worth the extra money to visit. Do see the night show if you have the time."
"A very well organised event. Unfortunately the sihnage wasn;t cear. we went a big round, just to know that we had passed the place long ago. we need to walk back to get into the flora fantay."
"My wife and I and 3 of our friends visited Gardens by the Bay on 13 Aug under the free entry scheme for senior citizens. We could only enter the Flower Dome free of charge. The flora and fauna were refreshing to the eyes but there could have been more flowers from other lands shown. I loved especially the orchids, especially the many local hybrids, on display. Overall, it was quite enjoyable to be among the greenery and flowers."
Amazed by the interior flower arrangement in Flora Fantasy. Good for phototaking. It will be even better if the site is larger.
"Has lot to offer for both adults and kids. Specially for nature lovers - so many different types of vegetation, flowers and gardens. Country specific gardens are also there."
"Good exposure to different species of orchids and their origins. If there are more flowers to be exhibited, that will make the trip more enriching."
Beautiful place to visit in the afternoon with kids! There are a lot of kinds of trees and flowers which wow the kids and very good spot for photos!
Gardens fee and ok but focus on greenhouses as these are the main attraction. Nice escape from city. Food court very poor (Satay by sea). Eat elsewhere. Pay extra for tree walk - worth it
This place is an amazing sight day and night. It's so well thought out and executed. It's also free to walk around (without going into the domes). Where else in the world would you get that?!
"What a beautiful evening out.So much to see, so colourful. The effort put into creating and maintaining the gardens would have been mammoth.I do wish your talks about sustainability flowed to outside of the domes, where single use plastic is everywhere.More eating options close to the domes would really be awesome.More organisation around the taxi ranks would be appreciated too.The light show was simply stunning."
"Have s great family outing, went there to celebrate the NDP, the concert was great and lots of people are enjoying themselves."
"We bought a combined ticket for the three main gardens. The first one, near the entrance, is the one we liked more: tiny, but every single detail was thought through. A shuttle was taking us to the Cloud Forest. We walked then to the skywalk. A lot of different type of flora to see and smell and architecture to admire."
"Arrived at 3.30pm on the 12th. As soon as we checked into our hotel we headed off to the Gardens. Omg it was busy. A little pricey, but that is to be expected as it's Singapore. I must say the Gardens are worth the price and the wait.However; I would suggest better crowd management is needed. We waited in a que for over an hour with dozens if people jumping the que trying to get a little further ahead. This spoilt the experience a little."
"Go there late in the afternoon, explore the gardens, and in the evening, when darkness falls, see the lightshow on the trees."
Enjoy walking in the cool weather. Love the beautiful and colorful . The waterfall was lovely too. Will visit more often since I bought the annual pass.
"Gardens by the Bay is such a nice treat in such a large, industrialized city. However, it requires visitors to walk a lot while on the grounds - but there is plenty to do around every corner! We would highly recommend the light show at night, as this makes for amazing pictures and videos (there is a large crowd - so be prepared for tourists!)"
This place is interesting especially with kids. Lots to see and learn and what better way to escape the smouldering heat.The shear vastness of this place is commendable with the plethora of flora and fauna.Definitely worth a visit with the family while in Singapore
"Love the flower dome very much, each time I visit it's different theme and the flowers are all blooming well. Love It!"
"Enjoyed our trip to the gardens, but at over $50 pp to see all the main attractions, seemed a bit steep.A lot of stuff for kids obviously so perhaps we're not the target market, but it was still very nice.Also felt like maybe it is more amazing to visitors from countries that don't see gardens every day.You could probably just do the sky walk and one other - such as the flower dome with the 4D ride in it - and that would suffice."
We didn't know what to expect when we inside these amazing 'dome like enclosure'. What awaited was an amazing beautiful garden with plants and flowers from different parts of the world. The facility was well designed with thoughtful flow and it never felt crowded. The flowers were exquisite and the colours were uplifting. Well worth the entry fee. We then moved into the next dome where there was an enormous indoor waterfall feature which gave the arena a lovely coolness. You can go to the top of this man made waterfall and there are some very nice views from the platforms leading up to the top. There is an elevator so it's suitable for the physically challenged.All in all a spectacular addition to the attractions of Singapore.
Definately worth the hour or two you may spend here. The gardens are a very pleasant environment and interesting to see the various plants and the very old trees that they have transplanted into it. See if you can find the petrified tree trunks - hint - you sit on them. There are a large number of sculptures here all made from driftwood amazing achievement.
"Gardens by the Bay is a place for fun and exploration as within its vicinity, there are multiple pavilions - each having a racial theme where visitors can learn more about the various plants that plays integral parts in those societies.In addition to that, it also has 2 cloud domes where you can visit and enjoy the various plants and flowers that grows there! Well since they are air-conditioned, visitors would have to pay an entry fee but the rest of the garden is free for public to enjoy.I conducted an orientation program at the venue for my CCA and it was pretty successful as students get to be outside of school and learn some new things that they won't usually know about. There's tons of things that you can do including playing group games as each location has quite a huge space.Plus at night, there's always a 15min light show at 8pm!"
Wonderful place to visit as many different types of tree and plants beautifully sculptured. A must place to visit when you are in Singapore
I went there many times. Most of the time was during Christimas as it was the month of my daughter birthday. We like the music which was performed during at night. The lighting there also beautiful. We went round to take pictures of all the Christmas trees and the decorating was fantastic.
"It is a beautifully made outdoor garden, along with Flower Dome and Cloud Forest, the whole family can easily spend an entire afternoon here. My family (2 adults, 2 kids age 15 and 7) had fun exploring around the garden. It is considered one of the tourist icons in Singapore and pretty unique, so I suppose coming here for the first time and not visiting it would be akin to going to Paris without seeing the Eiffel tower. Afterward, we went for an early dinner at Marina Bay Sands which had plenty of dining options. The free light and music show at night was not bad, but not nearly as spectacular as others had suggested. It had a touch of Vegas vibe. My teenage daughter got bored halfway and wanted to leave. Maybe it was the heat."
"Gardens aren't usually the most exciting of places. Sure, if you are a huge flower fan or are really into ponds, they might be the highlight of your holiday, but to your average person they are just pleasant places to kill an hour or 2. Gardens by the bay is different, a futuristic wonder beamed down from space that might just be the best tourist attraction in Singapore."
Excellent garden. The supertrees and tje laser light performances in the evening are beautiful. The flower dome and the cloud forest dome are both well worth visiting.The Garden by the Bay is must see for visitors to Singapore.
"garden by the bay is one of many favorite place in singapore, this place is very amazing and very cool, so many flower and tree from worldwide in there."
"Absolutely bad service. During COVID-19, only one attraction open, which was a disappointment. The website is also very laggy."
"Please provide more options to made the booking to enter the premises, like through website. your current practice is must download your apps, i dont want to have too many apps in my phone, thanks"
"It's a good attraction but there is nothing exceptional. It's a huge area and can easily take half a day if you want to see the whole thing. The queues are always long. There are two domes, a Skywalk and several gardens. The flower dome has a collection of plants and flowers, and the cloud forest is a bigger dome with an artificial rainforest. The skywalk is an elevated walkway. Gardens are all small ones and host a variety of plants & flowers. Good feeling, Green surroundings but nothing exceptional. Recommended to go in the evenings only. We were there during Christmas and New Year, so everything was better decked-up."
"As compare to last year 2019, this year sakura flora is lesser and the flower is not as attractive as last year. I understand that there is limited space however i feel that the setup can be done better so that we visitors has more things to do."
"We were so looking forward to visiting here, and paid S$50 to go into the two domes. I was expecting to see exotic plants but I was in for a shock, they had some cacti all of which you can see in the UK. Some orchids all of which you can buy in UK supermarket, and the rest was made up with snap dragons bizzy Lizzies geraniums roses and other flowers that I grow in my own garden. Very disappointing, I think the S$50 I paid covered the total cost of the seeds used to create this garden.Outside of the domes the supertrees light up to music, and they have a long lake with colour changing balls on it, a bit like Christmas every day, not impressed."
Another very disappointing sight seeing effort. Nothing on the web site when we purchased our tickets to say one of the gardens was closed. Would have been nice if trip advisor provided better details. Arrived only to find one dome closed for renovations. Not happy with the price paid to find out we had paid full price to see everything only to learn dome was closed. The other dome was having renovations done as we walked around. Check it is all open before you purchase a ticket.
"The gardens are huge, signs are not that great and there is far too much concrete, Forget about bringing someone elderly as the drop off areas are very far from some of the speical floral shows. DONT stay to late because lighting is poor and you wont be able to find yr way out easily .."
"This was to be the highlight of our trip but we left deflated. Floral fantasy was good, but the flower dome conservatory was very disappointing, mostly mature trees and random sculptures. Enjoyed the Cloud forest, worth the admission. Had an inclusive ticket which included the observatory, but paid extra for the skywalk, which was a complete waste of 16$. View from observatory restricted because of the steel structure.The gardens are a place where you have to visit,but for us wasn't the wow factor we expected.Ps, don't pay for the shuttle, it is not necessary and a waste of money"
"It was nice but too touristy. It was the first time I visited 2 dorms, there were too many people so I had to get in a line and wait for too long. Does it worth it? I'm not sure! Inside the dorm, there were many different types of trees and flowers from all over the world. However, to see orchids, I'd prefer go to the Botanic gardens because there were not too many kinds of orchid there, there must be places for other kinds of plan. The waterfall inside the dorm was amazing."
"outdoors though..Amazing garden, loved the place a lot. Worthy place for taking nice photographs, and there are lots of food choices within the area. Parking is ample and easy to find too. I'm really impressed with the whole place. At night, the light shows are really magical. Can easily spend a whole day at this place with kids."
a great place to visit but please do not eat or drink in the flower dome. drinking of plain water is also not allowed from what I understand.
The garden is big very big with audio tours and sky walksThe gardens are free but the sky walk is $ 8 eachIt is very empty at this time so no queuing and lots of roomGet there by metro for $2.00The selection of plants is massive and if you add the cloud forest greenhouse and flower dome (at a cost) it is fantastic
The majority of tourists will visit this location for the evening light show which was entertaining enough. We found the paid dome attractions overpriced and disappointing for what they were. The botanical gardens provide a better spectacle for free.
The gardens are really laid out well. Designed in different country layouts.Unfortunately to go onto the walkways in the trees there's a charge. To go into the cloud garden there's are charge.Make it a entry fee and open it all
"The Floral Displays at the Flower Dome were impressive. As it was the first day of the Lunar New Year, there were far too many people visiting the Flower Dome.Cloud Forest - The 35 metre man made mountain and waterfall tied in very well with the Flower Dome.Floral Fantasy - We opted for the first slot of the day at 9.00 a.m. The music was beautiful and the garden was picturesques. There were no visitors early in the morning and we had the floral garden all by our ourselves."
the ecosystems are well conceived but the whole experience is marred by complexity of ticketing and hence delays in getting admittance.
"I know this isn't a popular comment but I didn't really enjoy the domes. Quite expensive and felt like I was in a busy procession of selfie takers trudging along! The super trees however were great despite handing over more cash to do the canopy walk. If I were to do it again I would miss out the costly domes, go when it's slightly cooler in the evening, pay for the tree walk and stay for the light show. Maybe the heat and crowds just got to me yesterday!"
The Gardens were very busy and long wait times to get into any of the gardens. I would recommend going early in the day
"Gardens by the Bay is a must see visit when in Singapore? My partner is in work assignment in Singapore and we go often.We decided to visit the lunar new year showcase on Tuesday Jan 21rst. One regular and one senior ticket requested. I had left home without my passport so I was unable to take advantage of said discount. I was flattered that they thought I did not qualify. That was a great January birthday present,My partner showed me the tickets for entry and one for shuttle. We proceed to shuttle. The staff at shuttle would not let us ride as we were two with one shuttle ticket. We showed our receipt that we paid for two passengers. She instructed us to go back to the entrance gate and Q again to get a second ticket. Then she also suggested walking about 20 steps to the ticket window and maybe they could help.We did that and at that window we were told we had to go back to the entrance ticket office and Q to get the second ticket. Frustrated we headed back to the original Q and saw the original agent.NOW THE MISSING SHUTTLE TICKET HAD A VALUE OF $1.75. We stated that we only got 1 ticket for 2 people. She said we lost the ticket. IN ESSENCE CALLING MY PARTNER A LIAR AND MAKING OUR MISSING TICKET OUR PROBLEM. UPON HEARING THAT I TOLD MY PARTNER TO GET A REFUND OF EVERYTHING.The gate agent refunded our flower dome tickets and what we paid for shuttle.In Essence walking two paying customers over a $1.75sgd Golf cart seat.This could have been easily been resolved in under 2 seconds.We showed the tram agent one ticket and a receipt for 2 paid seats on the tram. She could have simply let us board and made a note on the ticket. She could have then let the gate agent know what happened. The gate agent next to the shuttle could have done the same thing. She did not. The original agent could have issued a second ticket. Instead she said we lost it after telling her we never got it (guest is lying).SOMETIMES IT IS FORGOTTEN THAT AS A BUSINESS YOU ARE IN THE HOSPITALITY BUSINESS NOT THE HASSLE THE CUSTOMER BUSINESS.WE celebrated my January 20th belated birthday another way and still had a wonderful day.YOU ARE STILL THE BEST PLACE TO VISIT."
"It's a delightful place, but all the best bits are free.The Sky Walk is pretty short, crowded and no big deal.The temperate (?) flower dome is full of daft lego exhibits."
The gardens are nice but they should improve restaurant choices. They are very cheap and bad food except for one which is obv often full.
Public garden located near MRT station. Combined with beautiful light show. Must prepare to walk to enjoy sightseeing unless you must pay extra for tram
"Interesting but not as good as Jewel Changi Airport, Jewel is free of charge and in my opinion much better than Gardens by the Bay, also has several hundred shops and eateries. such an amazing place. also the paid electric transfer bus at Garden by the bay is a ripoff"
Pretty crowded and over the top Christmas decorations in addition to the normal gardens. I think I would prefer it during a regular time instead of Christmas.
A nice botanic walk with a range of beautiful flowers. We got this in a package that included the Cloud Forest.
"This is a must do in singapore, however if you are not a loving nature person you might find this place a little bit overrated."
Impressive light show to music. There were numerous gardens that were free to wander through. The lighting at dragonfly lake was impressive in the evening. Despite lots of people the queues for the paid attractions were well managed and so not too long. This is a great attraction for those who enjoy flowers and those with children.
"We visited during the evening to catch the light show in the supertrees. Unfortunately, the Supertree Grove was not accessible due to the a ticket Christmas fair so we could only watch from the outside. The lightshow as ok, nothing to shout about but perhaps we missed the full experience not being closer and not being able to hear the music.We had dinner at Satay by the Bay. It was hot and smoky and my food from a seafood stall took so long to be ready that my companions had finished their food by the time mine arrived. I would not recommend eating here if you can help it.Upon leaving, we wanted to take a taxi but unfortunately the queue was so long and I overheard a guy asking a group of tourist in front of me if they wanted to take a private transfer as taxis could take at least an hour. All of the taxis I could see were either flashing ""On call"" or ""Shift Change"".So we decided to take a 20 min walk to the Bayfront MRT. What a mess it was, even to buy an MRT ticket. And the MRT staff who was supposed to be assisting didn't tell people in the queue that the ticketing machine only took $2 or $5 and we had to go and get a change. The MRT counter initially didn't want to assist in breaking up our $10 note, which would have left us stranded.All in all, have your transport game plan sussed out before visiting. and plan to eat before or after."
"Great spectacle but part closed due to weather. Overall, good experience, however, it was overcrowded, no etiquette or manners by some people in tour or family groups. It was Xmas but no excuse for Me Me behaviour and a family ticket 90$ is not cheap. Cafe on site good value & cheap. Expect to walk everywhere.Located near to Marina Bay Sands Hotel (MRT). Won't be coming back."
"We heard that the beat time to visit it was in the late afternoon or early evening, so we went there at around 5. The gardens are well kept and the cloud forest is amazing. The food, satay by the bay was fantastic(we had satay and chilli crab). But it was an absolutely nightmare to get a taxi to return to the hotel. We had to queue up for more than an hour to get the taxi. The other option was to pay more to get a taxi( S$50). We refused. We were miserable by having to wait too long. Singapore added a bitter taste to our trip. Too crowded. Only if you are willing to pay more you can get the best services. Everything comes with a price."
"Lovely Poinsettia X'mas at Flower Dome. Cool stalls and lovely choruses at X'mas Wonderland. Lightshow and soap snow was cute too.Too bad the layout was poor as e-ticket holders can only exchange for physical tickets at a booth at the Visitor Centre, despite the different entrances stating 'online tickets'. Super uncool to have to traverse from the Meadow all the way to the Visitor Centre in the rain. Also uncool that diners cannot enter Supertree Grove without the X'mas Wonderland ticket."
We visited on Christmas eve 2019 for the Christmas light show. All i can say is that it is a massive security hazard waiting to be set off. There were throngs of people trying to leave at around 8 with lots more trying to get in via one staircase from the Gardens to the bridge leading to marina Bay Sands through one set of escalators down to the shopping complex. Just imagine the chaos if there was an incident that triggered a stampede.The show itself was nice but a bit repetitive. We werent told the ODBC skyway was closed at 4 so we would have to come back another day to that. The Flower dome was a bit ordinary but the Cloud Forest was great with fantastic architecture. The Skyway itself was short but we were fortunate to visit during a solar eclipse so spent time up there watching the eclipse. It's certainly unique enough to visit once and tick that off your list. Not sure it warrants repeated visits.
"This review is aimed at westerners who are fortunate enough to have travelled a bit. We were less than impressed with the domes at gardens by the bay. The flower done was basically the plants we grow in our garden (which are not native to Singapore) and the cloud dome was mildly interesting, but the crowds and wait times put us off. The free and public gardens did look like they were worth time and we would have gone back for an afternoon if we could have. We were there on the Sunday before Christmas and the crowds were unpleasant. We did see the Christmas display at night and the super tree light show which was impressive. If I was advising visitors, I would recommend finding out the slower times and I would question whether or not the domes are worth the entry fee. The super trees are worth seeing at night and the public park looks excellent. If you want to see indigenous plants, however, the botanical gardens are more likely to please."
"I love coming visiting the 2 domes. However, there aren't enough places for the elderly to sit and rest. Especially during peak times. There also not enough seats outside the domes to sit and wait. Its not elderly friendly."
"This is not really a place for garden lovers, more a theme park for family interest. The information on what was happening , where to queue, etc was very limited. We went in an evening just before Christmas so it was very crowded and we decided that the queues for the domes were too long. However the evening light and sound show was worth coming for. The BotanicGardens would be a much better visit for serious gardens."
"Went for Christmas Wonderland 2019. Deco and atmosphere was fine, but the process to get the tickets were troublesome. Although tickets were booked online, still had to retrieve physical tickets at a gate that was a 15 minute walk away from the MRT exit. The counter to retrieve the ticket was not even obvious, it was merely a long table with 2 staff to hand it out. (pity the 2 staff members sitting there) Thankfully staff were helpful and friendly, it was just bad planning on the management level."
"$8 for the walk is more than worthy, however a couple queue in front of me & 2 ladies queue behind me found that they do not have ticket, it was a Long queue to access the OCBC skywalk bridge (entrance), they discovered that they need to buy tickets at a ticketing booth 30 metres away, too bad, they have to go buy ticket & queue again.So tourist, buy your tickets first.I wonder the management can do something about ticketing information.7.30pm light show, best enjoy on the ground, avoid go up to the OCBC skywalk during that time.The view on the bridge was breath taking, however, the bridge has only 80 people capacity, there are sign to tell tourist keep to 15 minutes stay so others have chance to enjoy the view too.I was there on 22 Dec 2019, 8:40pm was just a nice slot after the light show. However, my holiday mood was spoilt by a very rude female staff keep yelling 'keep moving forward', (not even a please). Most of the tourists were standing therefor less then 10 second right after we came out from the lift. Anyway, hope we won't have to meet her anymore for the rest of our holidays."
"Visited in the week before xmas so the effect of the 'trees' was spoilt by an overload of neon chtistmas lights. Qued for aound 30 minutes to experience the walkway which was beautiful, particularly as we were lucky to be up on it just as the light show started. It is a strange but lovely instillation and quite reasonably priced to experience."
"My family and I had come here with very high expectations as we have never been to anything like this. We enjoyed ourselves very much but we were disappointed when it came to the Cloud Forest. Throughout the 2 Domes, there weren't many flowers. The other thing that made our experience bad was the waiting time for going up to the Cloud Forest was 50 min+.Be prepared to ""snake""around queues of people."
"We just did not enjoy this exhibit and felt it was overpriced. We were surprised when we walked in and found a large area was devoted to desert plants and cacti, since we expected tropical plants."
"I was seeking a place to stroll around in nature, and while the Gardens are beautifully crafted, I found them too man made, not wild and natural enough. Everything seemed to be manicured or turned into an attraction. I still enjoyed walking around but it took me a while to find the quiet areas, by the Indian garden and down by the water and the lily pond. There were some nice views of Singapore on the bay side as well. Maybe it's nicer in the evening with the lights - it wasn't really my kind of thing."
"With hot weather in Singapore, I felt Gardens by the Bay is a great place for family outing especially. The two Domes are enough for a full half day gathering."
"Went with my wife, her first comment was GBTB must have changed their curator. Th3 effort put in to this year's Xmas theme looked lacklustre..."
Visited the flower dome and cloud forest then walked the gardens before taking in the light show.Take my review for what it's worth since I am not a big floral enthusiast. The show was entertaining but just not my cup of tea. I think it's an activity that you must do when you visit. I just wouldn't spend too much of my time here.
"The Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest are both for-pay attractions, and that is what most people will aim for. If you're a flower lover, or just like to see plants from other parts of the world, you'll enjoy this attraction. But if that does nothing for you, you'd probably zip though it pretty quickly.I'd say this is worth visiting, if you have your garden-loving relative in tow with you. It will occupy several hours of an afternoon, if you are looking for something to do. But kids would get bored quickly."
This is a great place for Instagram content and for people who love flowers and plants. Be forewarned that this place is very crowded which will definitely put a damper on your picture taking and overall enjoyment of a nicely put together horticulturist's dream.
Told we had to see the laser and sound show around these giant cooling towers covered to look like S\F trees. Easy to find on Bayfront MRT station with an A\C walkway all way to the attraction. Got there with 5 minutes to spare had a good view but we were a bit disappointed as the sound was very quiet and the trees changed colour a few times. No laser lights to be seen but it does make a good evening stroll around marina bay with the iconic marina bay Sands hotel behind you with its three towers and the cantilevered whale across the top.
"i spend my time to visit garden by the bayso amazing place , Enjoy to take timewe can to see beautiful flowers and plant more..very nice ..to visit"
"A nice way to spend an hour or so but many of the plants and flowers you can see in your own back garden. Rhododendrons, azaleas, roses etc. For us, for what it was, we felt it was a bit expensive, $28 Singapore dollars each to visit both domes. Would recommend if you love plants and want a couple of hours in the cool as it's well air conditioned."
"its a big garden with limited facilities for tourist to enjoy, staffs are not helpful and you will easiliy get tired walking around. The views are just okay..."
My review of the gardens by the bay visit with my family. The best and the tips.A pleasant experience which can be better with a little preparation.
The exhibition hall is quite small and I completed the whole place in less than half hour.But the floral display are really beautiful and the 3D show is good.
"Booked the skywalk for early evening, but were moved along it at quite a pace as restricted numbers allowed at any one time. Views over gardens good, neon park and lit trees provide an unusual element to the garden."
"We were dropped off at the Entrance of GBTB only to find out we had to walk all the way to the RED DOT Museum to collect the tickets.Under the FIERY HOT SCORCHING Sun we were told to take a shuttle then walk to the RED DOT Museum. It was the most unbearable experience as the staff kept telling us to walk over. Shuttle, Cross a pedestrian bridge, into a mall, walk all the way to the end of the mall , out in the sun again to the end of the promenade... just to collect the tickets. That was definitely a Marketing PLOY for Red Dot Mesuem. Finally had to walk to the adjascent office building to mail a taxi back to GBTB.It was a nice experience cooling inside the cool blowing temperatures, with our sweat drenched shirts and pants. Needless to say we caught a cold the next day!!Dont spoil your visit, buy the tickets at the main entrance!!"
beautiful area to walk around and you can see many types of flora and fauna here. Its design is not the best as you keep walking in circles
"Great location with many areas to visit, we toured both domes, well worth it.Need a few hours needed to walk thru both domes.Care if there are storms around for if you want to take the ""skywalk"", this activity could close without notice. It will not re open if closing time approaches 9pm.The light show is well worth it, its free..two shows 7.45 pm and 8.45pm. Plenty of places to eat....good views of Marina by the Bay as well. After shows it's a mad dash for taxis, we waited 20 mins on a week night."
"May have made a mistake going in the morning. Maybe late afternoon or early evening, with all the lights, it's better. However, it was a nice thing to do for a couple of hours, and nice and cool in the domes."
"The show was free, met some great people. But not that amazing. Just trees and lights. Pretty aquariums with different type of fish"
I saw gardens and lights but it was not special I guess you have to have an appreciation for such. I will try again
"We decided to visit the Gardens by the Bay whilst staying in Singapore, being totally honest we were left slightly disappointed having paid $36 each to obtain entry into a couple of the exhibitions.The Floral Fantasy does have some very exotic and interesting flowers/plants as does the Flower Dome but it's not really worth the entrance fee.The Cloud Forest was unfortunately closed for maintenance, we didn't get a chance to walk around the public gardens as it was dark when the light show finished.The light show which is formed around and onto the Super trees is a great spectacle and was by far the best thing we saw and it's free, the show starts at 19.45 each evening and lasts for 15 minutes.My advice would be to walk around the vast public gardens during day light and then take in the Super Tree light show both free of charge."
"If your into gardening you will love this, and it is beautiful and some of the displays are fantastic but after a while it gets a little boring.Glad I've done it, wouldn't do it again. Did get some good photos though"
The gardens were nice but it had an artificial feel. My husband and I preferred the Botanical Gardens which has a more nature feel.
"You have 10 minutes from when you get to the skywalk. This was the highlight of my trip to the gardens. I purchased tickets through Klook which was very easy to use. The dome with the waterfall had about an hour wait. the line looped for so long that we opted to skip it. We spent about 3 hours there + another hour waiting for our entrance time to get to the skywalk. We went after the 8:45 show time and the trees were beautiful at night.I suggest to be prepared to stay longer than 3 hours especially when it's crowded and if you want to take breaks, sit down in the garden, wander around. 2-3 hours to visit the domes and skywalk.If you have a hard time walking like I did, then buy the pass that includes the shuttle (airport cart type of transit) since it's a bit of a walk to get from entrance points to the domes."
"Firstly, I didn't have time to visit the domes, although local friends say they are worthwhile. As to the rest it's a well-maintained series of spaces of which the highlight is the skyway walk between the artificial super trees (in fact air exhausts) and the views.The downside is that this place is really busy, and you will have to queue and dodge the selfie-takers."
"Went to the Flower Dome on Saturday 5 Oct 6pm - hubby on wheelchair. It was good that we did not need to join the very long queue but realised it was not so easy to manoeuvre the wheelchair because of the slope downwards dragging the wheelchair along and the crowd. The upper level was more greenery than flowers. The lower level was so crowded that it was not easy to get a good picture taken with the flowers, as the wheelchair was bulky. As a result, we finished 'viewing' in about 30 minutes. Exiting was an issue as we could not see the sign and ended up joining the queue to the Cloud Dome. When the usher was asked, she gave the wrong instructions not meant for a wheelchair and we ended up in the souvenir shop again, looking for an exit. Had to ask another staff again and she said to take the lift up and it took some searching through the crowd to spot the lift at the Cloud Dome queueing area. It would be great if a flyer with instructions for wheelchair users is given."
"The first thing to know about Gardens By The Bay is that it is one massive tourist attraction. It has highly constructed facilities that you can pay to go into, plus it has large gardens, ponds, and even a few aquariums around the property that are offered free of charge.For many, they find this location a great place to spend time with the family. It is also a good place to get in a little exercise and walk and/or run around.Personally, for those of us who know what this area of Singapore used to be like... Meaning, those of us who are a little bit older, we may remember what this area previously was, once upon a time. For me, that was a much more ascetically pleasing period of time in Singapore. This is not to say that Gardens By The Bay is not a great place but I am just saying that it lacks any true Singaporean culture.So, go here if you want to interact with a lot of tourists and see some marginally interesting tourist attractions. But, if you want to see what Singapore is truly all about, you may have to go to other locations."
"I liked it here, there are a number of gardens free to view but it does get pricey if you want to step inside the domes or go on the cloud tree walk (sky walk?) the name escapes me...Not quite full value for money but it was good to see."
The place is well maintained but very fake.and.crowfed I would not the time to go again. The light shows are pleasant but the walkway is quite chaotic
The garden is awesome seriously well maintained and nicely decorated but forest and orchid which is paid is not worth cause the is a orichid garden which was much better. And if u want forest atmosphere u should visit the bird park it's awesome. Both forest and orchid are artificial with AC and all doest not have any natural touch but don't miss the garden lighting event in evening which is very good.
"I went to the flower garden and cloud forest for $28 and while it was nice it didn't really blow me away, certainly not an essential stop to make during your visit to Singapore"
"I think the outside is prettier than going inside. You can take a subway to get to the Gardens. But you need to purchase another ticket to take a trolley to take you inside the garden. Otherwise, you can walk"
"Very impressive, in its wholly artificial way. But if you arrive by MRT, you walk along a very broad, very beautiful, passage, to arrive at a steep, narrow, staircase, and a wholly inadequate lift. No escalator, presumably because the Important People who come to be shown around do not arrive by train. But when it is crowded it is positively dangerous. And the signage, esp when you are trying to find your way out at night, is hopelessly bad. Such a shame."
Especially with kids our advice is to go but not pay (the really excessive) prices for the two bits. They were by far the worst & most underwhelming parts. The free stuff far out strips & the light show daily at 7.45pm is brilliant.
"From the bridge if you look down to 2 side of the river. This is amazing outlook. I didnt take the shuttle bus because i think work through the garden would be more interesting to discover. However, if you go through the garden like flower dom feel more disappointed of the place. First step in, along the first line where some flower seem dried of water. There is only one corner look perfect when you go to the end of dom garden. And what you found is a nice orchid flower there to take a picture there. I love more at forest garden. This more green as a waterfall is nearby."
It was impressive how they maintained a huge indoor garden.I hope there were more seating areas to rest and simple enjoy the view of the flower gardens.
"The garden is cool, have 14 different gardens of different cultures. but the famous light show is just so so. Only Music+Lights. Skyway has a good view, 25 meters high, which is about 8th floors, but you are only allow to stay for 15 mins up there."
"Gardens by the Bay are beautiful by day and especially at night, but we were very disappointed when we were given wrong information about what time to arrive to book a time slot for the skywalk at dusk. We were told to get there for 6 pm which we did but then found out that all the time slots had gone. Conservatories and gift shop closed early too. We feel the organisation and signage were non-existent. In fact, there is no real need to buy tickets - just turn up and walk round."
"Technically it was not a ""couples"" visit. There was no ""family without kids"" option to select. Went with partner, partners ' parents and extended family, all in their 50s and 60s so couldn't select ""family with teenagers"".It's ok for me...... partner and partner's parents and extended family loved it so that was all that mattered. Otherwise it looks like a bunch of artificial structures to me."
I and my parents are disappointed because of the crowds..and we can't enjoy both the flower dome and cloud forest..ppl pushing and just can't get good pictures.Just too crowded.Even in the queue to get in ppl just cant wait to get in and cut my family's queue.Overall we love the landscape .
Don't get me wrong gardens by the bay is beautiful but they want so much money to go in and have a look it was a joke the botanical gardens are so much better
"Lovely place to visit if you love plants. A bit overcrowded. Be prepared to walk a lot if you wanna visit cloud forest, floral fantasy and flower dome plus other free gardens. I preferred the orchid garden held at Singapore botanic gardens. I did the night show with hop on hop off night city tour - bring a mat along so that you can lie down and see the night show... it's magical. Same can also be viewed from the bridge connecting marina bay sands to gardens by the bay... free."
"If you've never been in a real tropical jungle or forest, the Gardens by the Bay would seem worth it and amazing. Kudos to the engineers who crafted this all together, and to the marketing staff, you all deserve a raise, but this was like going to a petting zoo with no animals. If you enjoy long walks through crowds and feel like cattle being herded along, this place is for you. Maybe if there were more interactive exhibits instead of just staring at plants and lights, it would have been more enjoyable. The tree show or whatever it was called was pretty cheesy. It was like watching my Christmas tree flash its lights to music. I'm glad to have experienced it but would have rather spent my money on a second dessert. On the other hand, if you have kids and want to tire them out walking, this is definitely the low risk, low adventure, family friendly activity you've been looking for!"
"Go on a week day morning, that seemed to be the better option. We arrived just after lunch and it was super busy. Your constantly touching people either side of you just to move around.It's a beautiful location, but just be prepared for heaps of people and sooooo many selfie sticks"
"Really enjoyed the gardens but probably didn't have enough time to fully appreciate them, had to deduct marks though for the children's play area. We thought the ground was rubber but in fact it seemed to be a hard rock and left the kids with cuts."
"the gardens are lovely, but be aware that outside of the air conditioned domes there is very little shade or places to rest. We regretted visiting on a sunny day!The cloud dome is the best attraction here in my opinion."
"We visited the Gardens by the Bay on a weekend, which was probably not the best choice. Things were very crowded. We did the sky walk, which was nice, but the staff was constantly asking folks to move ahead since there were long lines. The views are interesting, but probably not worth the price. On a less crowded day, we might have had a different feeling."
Went here with my husband for an afternoon stroll. It was nice to take a walk in the garden filled with many plants and flower. We started the journey on foot from the MBS side until the Cloud Forest dome. We took the shuttle for a return (SGD7).My overall experience : 3.5/5
It's really crazy... Every where you look... People queuing or taking pics.. Very hard to get a photo of myself alone with plants..queue for taxi almost half hour to go back... Makes me not want to come back..
"The price quite expensive, and we need to purchase EXTRA $3 for just a shuttle. which i thought the shuttle will drop at several places, but it's not. it's only from the ticketing office to somewhere nearby the MRT. should just get a free shuttle for those kind of price range.garden by the bay more like statue by the bay when i visited last week (july) quite disappointed."
"being a tropical climate, singapore tourism have thoughfully incorporated airconditioning in almost all of its tourist attractions.so the domes are a hide out from sweltering heat. you get to appreciate some really good ,intriguing species of plant. for us it was they are the carnivorous plants like pitcher and venus fly trap. micro orchids etc.flower dome that changes its theme every few weeks is definitely attractive. I dont know whether its worth the price of the entry fee."
This is a really nice place to stroll and sit in gardens. You can choose to spend money and look into the dome an other attractions or just wander by the river and admire the giant tree structures.
"Gardens By the Bay are very famous, however it's like a themepark. I get why it's iconic for Singapore but be sure to be there before or after the big Chinese groups.We went at 12am because the park closes at 3am so you can walk around freely all by yourself! You can't visit the other things because they close at 9pm but I doubt it's worth the money. Unless you like big groups of Chinese people."
Was expecting a bit more from this but overall a nice place to visit during the evening when the lights turn on. Light show is a bit lame to be honest
"We enjoyed the desert cactus and orchid scent sections.The rest is rather artificial and busy.The nearby 'satay by the bay' food court is a good place to get a meal afterwards, although the satay is not the best in Singapore."
"Most of the day visit was standing in various queues for the Cloud Dome and sky walk. You queue for tickets, then queue again to enter.The lights at night are fabulous though, so I suggest you go then but ticket sales stop at 8pm"
"We visited here with our family on our last day in Singapore. Given time constraints due to flights we thought a Cloud Forest experience would be best.On arrival at the ticket office we were told we had to buy a combined Cloud Forest and Flower Dome ticket despite explaining we did not have time to visit both.The queue to enter the Forest was not too bad, although maintaining any form of personal space was almost impossible! Our first view of the Forest was lovely but this is also where things started to go downhill.We were herded into lifts to reach the top floor which was challenging if you are at all claustrophobic. On reaching the top floor there were large numbers of people and it was difficult to see anything without being bumped or pushed. Any hope of finding a quiet spot to take in the surroundings was impossible. Floating walkways take you down each level where you can view the many differing plants and also views of Singapore. The walkway may be difficult if you have a fear of heights.On one level there is an educational section with film show explaining mans' global impact but most people just walked through without stopping. A real educational opportunity missed!!Really the sheer numbers going through the forest at one time completely spoiled the experience for our party of 7. Collectively we agreed we would have had a more enjoyable experience just walking through the gardens and enjoying the evening light show which we just caught the end of.Surprisingly, the toilets near the ticket desk at the Cloud Forest were not very clean."
It's a okay place to spend a couple of hours and let the kids run free. But it felt too touristy and gimmicky to me. The displays weren't exactly out-of-the-world. And most of the garden looks manufactured anyway.
Went here because i was told it is the thing to do. Out of the floral experience and the cloud forest i found this to be the least spectacular. Still lots of nice flowers and colours but not that spectacular.
"Nice and cool inside, we liked the cloud forest best. The flower dome was less interesting for teenagers."
"The whole area is pretty and nicely done. Singapore does a lot of things to bring back more green to their environment. They did a great job bringing in all those plants along with architectural design and it won't disappoint. However, I'm not going to over hype this place. It's worth a visit."
"We found the flower dome interesting to walk through, but the masses of selfy-takers gets very irritating. The tree dome is nicer, in particular the walkway. The lightshow was ok, but not to be rated as spectacular. Andre Rieu music is better to be heard live....We went afterwards to Satay at the Bay - dissappointing, and below the standard (and offering) compared to hawker centres in the city."
"A must but terribly busy when we visited and the signage is poor, we used the audio tour which took 20 minutes and to be honest it was enough for us. Probably age is a factor!"
"Very pretty gardens, worth the visit. Closes at 9pm only though, compared to everything else in the town, that's super early. There is a light show on the giant trees at 7.45 and 8.45pm, but it's only 10 minutes worth."
"another place which is now almost wholly dedicated to hosting selfie stick jousts. If you do happen to be there during a break in the tournament, you may catch a glimpse of some nice plants. Some people may even go there especially for the flowers."
"The much photographed, much covered on all social media, gardens, are taken on their own merit, perfectly good to see and spend time when in Singapore. However like so much of this city state, it's got that hermetic and soulless aspect to it. One dome has European plants that looked a little too twee to be anything more than a meek attempt all perfectly manicured but a real let down. The other dome is more inspiring with a lovely waterfall and a fabulous walkway and plant selection.However however in this world we live in, we always compare to prior experiences and I have to compare to Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew in Richmond England and The Eden project in Exeter area of England...both are so much more spectacular, real and take your breath away that's it's difficult to be impressed by the Singapore experience."
"We enjoyed the gardens and the open air parts are free to enter, all the enclosed areas had separate entrance fees. It was pleasant but not as striking as I had expected from reading about it. Go if you have spare time but don't worry if you miss it."
"Pleasantly surprised with GBTB, they had cutesy light and sound show which we stayed for. Nice to go to say you've done it. Unfortunately was getting dark when we went so only got to do that. Was free though!"
"Not many good thing, need something new. I think better visit on the month of Apr. Very boring when you visit with kids or boys."
"Ok, coming from NZ, beautiful scenery is not rare so there was not any wow factor for us. But it was nice and hubby was very interested in all the nuts and bolts of how they built it. If you can time it for the light show it is a bonus. Again, you only need to see it once. There is an awful crowd going for the trains at the end but it is tolerable if you are expecting this. Kind of fun staring up at the Marina Sands Hotel and imagining hiring out the Pres, Suite for $17K a night."
"The gardens themselves are spectacular. They are ruined by the rudeness of the peasants who tend to visit. There are signs everywhere advising not to touch the plants. These are largely ignored by spoiled Asian brats whose parents actually seem to encourage the bad behavior.However, if you can ignore this type of rudeness then the gardens are worth a visit. When it's time to leave, don;t be fooled by the Exit signs. They are for emergency use only. You need to find the Way Out sign instead."
Interesting visit.Its looking very tired.Staff very inattentive . Don't bother looking at you.Did enjoy the indoor section.The gentleman at ticket purchase was outstanding. Very good customer service and knowledgeable.
"Do not prebook tickets over internet! YOU end up having to spend one hour to go and collect them. Also avoid the restaurant serving Hainese chicken as they only have three portions per day, although they advertize it as one of their main attractions. The garden is fine but littered with doubtful ingredients as wooden mushrooms, gemstones etc."
"Some of the flowers have withered. But still nice can taking a picture,though. Love Gardens by the bay"
"The only thing that can be improved is the crowd.. too many people spolls the tranquility of the gardens. Love the ad hoc events that are organized in parallel like the children's festival. The rose romance display was a bit disappointing, the flowers were not concentrated enough, and many were dying."
We had limited time so we took the trolley tour. It gives you a good overview of the garden but you need to go on foot to look at things that interest you and to see details.
"Went to this venue due to all the hype. Well unless you are interested in plants & trees there is nothing more to do.I visited early morning so the crowds were not an issue. But after 30 mins it became more of the same, same. This place is a back drop for the selfie brigade.I wanted to do the skywalk but unfortunately it was closed for maintenance.The structure itself is quite impressive and the light show is when this attraction comes into itself.Singapore Botanic Gardens was a better option in my opinion."
The power points at the attraction spoilt the overall photo - should be covered or hidden behind some plants.
Too many people. Too far from home. Why cannot bring back the flowers? Photographer cheat money want sell the pictures so expensive.
"The Supertree Grove was closed due to weather. I'm not sure that attraction is worth the money. If you buy a ticket and they close, there are no refunds. Two different places to buy tickets with typically poor directional signage. Cloud Forest interesting, but a huge amount of walking. Using a wheelchair possible and the rental was super cheap but the pathways are not continuous so you end up on and off multiple elevators. Flower Dome was so-so, with some interesting trees. Not worth the fee. Some specimens have the plant name but almost nothing else."
"Not a cheap excursion, we took a joint ticket to visit the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome. I found the cloud dome disappointing, there is no cloud for a start. Just a lot of green plants growing around a central concrete structure.There is a walkway which is entitled the lost world, poor choice of description given the association with the movie. Its just a high walkway to look down on the plants.The flower dome was much better with the dome divided into different world regions.Overall I was disappointed in both, thought is was going to be considerably better than it was"
If you are a nature lover & has a good knowledge of plants & trees then only you should visit here otherwise boredome.
"The visit is compulsory even if just to see the electric trees... One of the very few locations actually in Singapore in Crazy Rich Asians!The gardens are nice for a stroll but that is about it. If it is too hot, go to the Botanical Gardens, much cooler.We were wrong to think there was only one entrance, you can access it through the main entrance or though another one by the Marina Bay Sands."
"Very nice place to visit, But you have to walk atleast 4-5 kms to explore Gardens by the bay park and 2 domes one with beautiful flowers and plants and another dome with artificial water falls."
"While the Gardens were interesting and highly recommended by other travelers on these sites, we personally were not ""spellbound"".Our current exchange rate is quite poor so we felt that it was not really worth the amount of money that we spent on a ticket."
"A must for all travellers to Singapore! It's is artistic and colourful. It is a long walk though, so make sure you have enough time to get around it all."
"This is an indoor garden with a spiral path for visitors to wander leisurely up to the top, or for older, or handicapped people to take the escalator to the top then walk down the gently down slopped path. The center of the building features a water fall. Unfortunately, the garden has no live. It has no butterfly, no fish, no frogs and no birds, just plants. It could have been a much more interesting place to visit otherwise."
i enjoyed the water falls in the cloud forest. the flowers was not that fresh in flower doom but it is ok. my daughter mesmerized the scenery of all the flowers and it was ok.
"We were forced to enter here and pay $28 per person for both places, even when we just wanted to check out the Cloud Forest. Just flowers.."
"Gardens by the Bay is a nice escape from the high-rises of Singapore. Easily accessible from Bayfront MRT.We did not do the paid domes as they were quite expensive but did do the $8 OCBC Skywalk. This was quite a good view from the canopy of the Supertrees and as it was coming onto evening a nice breeze to cool things down.The rest of the gardens are nice also, but as they are quite extensive, getting around them in Singapore's heat can be taxing."
We visited only the free areas of the garden. The trees and other plants are fine to get familiar with. Also nice views to surroundigs. Maybe paying in would have given us more - the free areas are 'just ok'.
Bought ticket day before for cloud forest and flower domeWhen we arrived at the ticket office was told that flower dome was shut due to maintenanceThey would not offer partial refund or let us go into floral fantasy as an alternative. Was told we could use our voucher to flower dome tomorrow but as I explained we aren't here tomorrow as fly to BaliApart from this place is beautiful
"The conservatories are well done but very unnatural. There is no ecosystem at all, and the temperature, while a nice break from the heat, felt off as a habitat. More importantly, as someone who has visited nature preserves around the world, this stuff is just super underwhelming. All this messaging on climate change and I wonder how much power it takes to keep these gardens green and the lights on."
"Had a view from the rooftop of marina Bay sands restaurant.A nice view from the top, pretty sure it's nice from inside."
"Although is interesting to see thousands of cactus and trees from different places around the globe, you will get bored latest after one hour. It is pretty crowded and you list be a plant lover to spend there more than an hour."
Floral fantasy is small. Can easily walk through in 30 mins but have to hang around to take photos to make my money worth
A very good place to start the tour . For once u will be astonished to see a complete forest like ambience being artificially built . And don't miss the night light show .Best time to visit is around 4pm .
"To be honest it's a nice place to walk , walk in the park ...and if you like waiting for ever in the heat than you will love this place , I am not sure what to see when you can to the botanic garden and enjoy a quiet and peaceful environment ."
"Its much hyped but good for nature lover ,nice maintenance done by staff and its chilly ,have to walk more"
"This is a really impressive area and good to look at, but what disappointed me, given it's pitched as a temple of sustainability and ecological awareness, was the total lack of thought given to food and drink packaging.Everything is made of or wrapped in plastic, including straws and cutlery, and much of it non recyclable. As you leave one of the big dome things you watch a video that's meant to inspire you to save the planet, then you step outside and all you can buy to eat or drink anywhere is the most unsustainably packaged, rubbish food you can imagine. At best it's a massively thoughtless missed opportunity, and at worst it's wilful hypocrisy."
The place was cool in fact!! Kids would love it! Very clean and neatt!! The trees pretty amazing and the pond!! As mentionned you should visit at night as the lights produce a way way better effect and change the type of experience you would have!!
The best thing about this is that the entire dome is airconditioned which makes a nice respite from the oppressive humidity and you get to kill few hours viewing plants you wouldn't ordinarily see. Kind of got boring for me after 2 hours though. Helps if you like plants and crowds.
"We visited again after a gap of 3 years. This time we saw additional varieties. But we were not prepared forthe chill inside (which is artificially maintained). So if you are taking your kids, ensure you carry warm clothes for them. The crowd also was too much and we could not enjoy it much. (We went on a Saturday)."
"Try to time your visit when there are theme exhibits, otherwise will be normal garden with air-conditioning. The waterfall is tall but really not much special. The treetop walk is worth a trip."
the parks size makes it a bit difficult to explore. we had different opinions about the evening Lightshow at dawn. Bring something to lay down to watch the show
It was the Sakura season hence the flower dome was filled with flowers from Japan and there were lots of Japanese style decorations. Worth going if there are special exhibitions like this.
"I went to Garden by the Bay, however, the cloud dome was closed for maintenance. My friend told me I have to spend 1.5 hours in a dome, however, I stayed there in 45 minutes. There is not much to see inside, unless you are interested in bottle trees, that's indeed very interesting. However, compared to the National Orchard Garden, which is S$5 entrance fee, I like the National orchard garden a lot more."
"I was very much looking forward to visiting 'gardens by the bay'. Unfortunately,due to late afternoon/evening rain I was unable to go at my preferred time. The outcome being I went the next evening (my last in Singapore) with a tight schedule, The gardens are sensational but not a wide range of species. The wait & crowd for the music light show (only 15 minutes) was a disappointment.. My Singapore highlights were the botanical Gardens & the Zoo."
It was nice to see the Sakura in bloom after leaving Japan some years ago. It brought back some good memories.
"My husband and I looked here to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. I had originally booked a table for 8 o'clock the previous day but asked if I could switch to the following day at the same time. I was told the only availability was at 6 pm which we accepted. However having vacated our table at 8 pm we were most surprised to find many available tables at this time.Every table has a nice view, and seating is comfortable.The food, whilst pleasant , is either luke warm or cold as everyone seem to have food served on cold plates. The drinks are the same price as elsewhere in Singapore but the food is a little more expensive but you're paying for fabulous views.All in all, I would suggest that you drink here and eat elsewhere. Nothing was made of our silver anniversary despite advising the restaurant on booking. This, (whilst not expecting anything) compared to other restaurants visited here who acknowledged our celebrations, was a shame.You can access as good a view from the Singapore Flyer or the Marina Bay Hotel."
"I only went to the Flower Dome this trip as I wanted to catch the sakura flower trees being featured. The garden in itself was very pretty and had a nice climate controlled atmosphere. However there was some manga event being held there and it was the last day of the sakura trees exhibition. I think this largely contributed to the place being just too crowded. To the point where I wanted to leave after about half hour. The management really shouldn't allow these special events to take place over the weekend and if they must, then close it to the public. They also need to look into controlling the number of people that can be at any given area at one time. In the event of a fire, it would've been total mayhem! I'd suggest that you go on a weekday and/or when there are no special events being held. That would definitely make your visit a lot more relaxed and enjoyable. As a visit to a garden should be."
Not advisable for old people sitting on wheelchair. The allowance of the place is too narrow.Can't enough viewing the Sakura.Disappointed.The staff standing there dunno what to do.
we visited here in Feb. we had heard a lot about this place but it was a bit disappointing. No doubt it was a beautiful place with lots of flowers and waterfall etc. but we felt everything is artificial. There were no insects in the Garden and every flower and plant looked manually painted.People looking for natural beauty must not go there.
"The Shuttle is needed when you are complete out of Energy. Otherwise it works without and for free. The Rain Forrest and the Botanic House is realy not a very special point to visit. Just for for Flip Flop Forrest and Garden Visitors. But the ""Trees"" and the Canopy is worth the Money!!"
I would like to suggest to have a signboard at entrance to mention not to touch plant or flower so other visitors get to enjoy too.
I think gardeners will appreciate the Singapore Botanical gardens more. This is a well thought out structure but not all about plants. More about getting people in moving them around and out. Too busy to enjoy.
Had call up the CSO to inquire regarding the price difference between the dome tickets and the flora attraction which I'm unaware off. He sounds impatient and blaming me for not reading carefully on the website which mentioned the new flora attraction opens in April which I thought the Sakura is holding at that place. Forgotten to ask him for his name.
"Sakura exhibit is in operation, there's a small Japanese fair accompanying it. Try out various samplings of Japanese food"
"We viewed this as a must-see site in Singapore, but were disappointed to find that there were extra fees for all the structures, the shuttle, etc. Unfortunately, we did not have time to go back at night, when the light show is supposed to be spectacular."
"Walked here from boat quay, weather was warm on this day. Don't expect more than a few nice photos. The lights changes & there were some thematic music that went along but that's it. Nothing exceptional."
"If you have been to Vegas, you will be so disappointed by the light show here. Do not plan to come for that show specifically like we did. Its over hyped. You will anyways see it in the night at least once while driving by in Singapore. Plan to do the sky walk instead, that's really a different experience"
"I bring my mum and foreign friend. They enjoyed it. When make some query, only certain staff, they see me is local not so courtesy."
"The sakura festival was way below expectation, it is hastily put up with very normal decoration.It was not what most visitors would be happy to see."
As an avid gardener I felt I could not miss this. It is the largest conservatory in the world and the second dome has the largest indoor waterfall. It is $28 Singapore dollars to get in to both Domes . I love the variety of orchids but did not appreciate Legos and fake stalagmites throughout the exhibits.
"Did the audio tour, was okay - but would not recommend.Given the choice between doing the tree top walk for S$8 or the Marina Sands for $23 - I would suggest the Marina Sands, as you are higher get a better view etc.Check before you go, as they sometimes close one of the green houses for maintenance. We only wanted to do 1 of them, but you can only buy a ticket for both."
One of the most best gardens ever seen with a mix of indoor (air conditioned -cool) and outdoor exhibits on offer ' you will not be disappointed .We took in the light show from the 57th floor of the Marina Bay complex after having dinner there and so glad that we didn't make the long walk across to the gardens themselves and the light show seemed a bit blah ' we could see all the lights on offer and hear the accompanying music but nothing all that special ' it also seemed to go on forever.
"The gardens was well maintained, however the exhibits in the flower dome did not seem to be much different from what we saw a few years ago. Still an OK experience to just walk around."
An interesting distraction in the city. We went towards the mid afternoon such that when dark fell we could see the trees fully illuminated .The day we visited part of the gardens were closed ( on a rotational basis as it turns out).We soon covered the park .The gardens post night fall looked enchanting.
"So natural nice place to.visit and spend some time in , it's quite big and massive and will be the right choice for natural lovers"
"Like mostly everything else in Singapure, it does not worth the heavy prices asked.Yes, it is worth a visit, but it's not up for th price."
"Not enough plastic recycling facilities and the Children's Garden CafÃ© gives plastic bags, cups and sauce containers with every meal. Considering the Cloud Forest exhibit has a sustainable planet presentation at the end, this is laughable (and somewhat sad)."
I probably had my expectations too high for this attraction I visited both domes the cloud forest was the best. Light show was amazing that's free. You can do the light show without going to the domes. It was nice but not anything amazing.
"Gardens by the Bay is a nature park consists of three waterfront gardens: Cloud Forest, Flower Dome (and not sure of the other one).Our family roamed the said place by riding in its ""mini train/shuttle"" since I forgot what do they call it. Every night, it has a light show that takes place in its Super Grove which showcases the famously known ""Super Grove Tree.""Highlights: Cloud Forest, Flower Dome, and Super Grove light show.Recommendation: If you have kids with you, it is best to try its mini train/shuttle to roam the area. (I forgot if this is for free, or not).Note: Cloud Forest, and Flower Dome are not free. Entrance fee is required. Super Grove light show is for free."
"It's filled with floral surroundings and take your time to be amazed by this park in the city. There's a lake with water lilies, breathtaking view and I don't have the opportunity to visit this during the night.Suitable to go with kids."
"The Cloud Forest is a victim of its own success, it is so instagramable that every millennial in the world seems to be there doing just that.Kew gardens and Eden Project both are similar to this in concept, but not scale.I'd say go to England and see the latter."
"Too much crowd. Not for people looking for a garden feel for which Botanical Garden is an awesome place. The light show is nothing much to speak about, rather disappointing."
"Be prepared for lots of walking and jostling with crowds at popular times. Some of the entrance and exit paths need widening to avoid queues. Food is pricey, as are the conservatory visits."
"Lots of fauna from different continent and some speciality. They have different theme on various season but I went on Chinese new year season hence is very crowded. The night show is very nice, worth for the wait."
"A nice place to spend an afternoon or evening at with family. The downside is, ticket package to the domes does not include the skywalk entrance; and that dome ticket is quite expensive by itself."
"The flowers are beautiful, but some are starting to wither. The temperature inside the dome is just right. Certain areas are especially crowded inside the dome. But generally a nice place for visiting."
"I wasn't impressed. With the amount we paid for the entrance fee, I expected a little 'wow' effect. Just didn't happen.Most of the flowers don't have name tags telling me what they are.Not sure how this attraction has so many great reviews. (?)If you're easily impressed, you should go.:-)"
"If you love plants its worth going, otherwise a bit of a tourist trap. Its a lot cooler in the dome, and a good rest bite from the heat. Would i go again? most likely not."
Very nice place But very crowdy. Inside the domes is very cold. Lovely views for the pictures. The mediteranean dome its not S-o spectacular like the other one
"This is indeed an impressive marvel of human abilities to build pretty and huge green houses.Yet, one has to be aware, that this is purely a tourist attraction, mostly Chinese and Middle East tourist attraction.If you are looking for a quiet, serene, green place, dont come here, head for the 'real' and trully amazing Botanic Gardens instead.If you like claustrophobia, noise, echo, crowds, stress, selfie mania, souvenirs, paying to get in....oh but no mosquitos or sunburn, then yes, go ahead! You will love it."
"We can find many varieties and some extinct plantsin cloud forest and flowers in the flower dome. It is a place which does not impress you that much . Place is just ok. Free Light show is amazing to . It is free , dont spend 28 sgd if you are not a plant and flower enthusiast, just watch the free light show ."
It's a nice place for walk with kids and family. there are lots of fishes into the lakes. Nothing extra ordinary but a worth to visit
"The two conservatory structures are huge and impressive when viewed from afar but the experience of going through them was disappointing. The Super Tree structures are intriguing but will look much better once they have filled in and are more covered with plants, You also have to pay multiple admission prices for each area so the cost can add up quickly."
"Not much to see then! The routes will not well organise in the first few days, kind of messy and lag directions or signage. After the first week, things improved a little."
The cloud forest is nice and and a good way to spend some time when its hot outside.But the light show is very over rated and a great disappointment.the marina bay sands one is better.the outside garden is nice but not when its hot.did not visit the flower garden - so i cannot comment on that.
Frankly speaking its a big glasshouse with a variety of flora from all over the globe. It's an engineering marvel. OCBC Skyway is a must visit place and costs a few bucks. The super trees lightning show is also decently good. But I believe the view from MBS might be a bit better.I think its a decent place but a bit overrated.
"Im not a fan of visiting trees, especially when i have to pay for it. But this place is different.i had a chance to see it once due to work, and i had to come back to see everything again carefully. The air-conditioned areas helped made it more enjoyable. Everyone should visit it once at least and you will see how beautiful the Earth can actually be if only we opened our eyes and our hearts. Best to go with family...or go solo of you want to heal or rejuvente yourself."
"I think this place was overrated. Although the falls was breathtaking, and the man made trees were works of art, but other than that, nothing really extraordinary. We went there at night to avoid the heat of the afternoon, and to see the lights at night. We were able to watch the Light Show, which was ok. Not really something unforgettable. The queues were long, especially going to top of the falls. Onlyto find out there's really nothing more to see."
Gardens are free to stroll around.Only pay if you want to go into the domes or walk around the sky bridge between the trees.Light shows are twice an evening and not long at all but very beautiful.Perfect place for the social media photos with marina bay sands in the background.Reasonable priced cafe and also a McDonald's in the ground.
"Odd, Tacky, novelty additions throughout, wouldn't visit again and still not sure what to make of it."
This place is living proof that humans can't create nature. Gardens By The Bay is a great attempt but really far from greatness
"We have visited the gardens before during the daytime and loved them. This time we decided to go at night. We went on the last available night of our trip and were very disappointed that despite having tickets for the gardens plus 2 domes we were only able to visit one. We arrived just before 8 pm and accepted that if we had come earlier it might have been different but no-one told us that the domes finished at 8.45!! We were enjoying the visit until told the gates were closing and on coming out found that everyhting seemed to be shutting down, including the gift shop!! I was also very disappointed in the lighting. The plants themselves were magnificent and had feauture lighting but we were not able to read any of the information panels. This could have been so much better."
"We went to the Cloud forest and flower Dome! The sky was suspended because of drizzle, rain or lightning! The two sections that we saw were ok but we enjoyed the botanical gardens more. Botanical gardens are cheaper and in our opinion better. It was cold at the Gardens by the Bay in Domes so take something to cover up. Also check the double deals and if you have booking. Com or TripAdvisor deals! It's great watching the Tree light show from underneath the trees."
"Come at night, it's cooler and the light show is better. However, be aware that it is a long walk from the MRT and it is very crowded."
"Building is in fine tune with the displayed trees and plants. Great crowd management.But felt too synthetic, specially the stalagmites displays, they belong in real cave. I've visited real cave."
Maybe my expectations where too high looking at photos etc. we did an audio tour of the park $8 was very informative then if you want to see the domes or the the sky walk everything costs extra
Strolling in the green is certainly refreshing after putting up with oppressive shopping in the mall.At night one can also enjoy the light and music show at the giant trees.Use a shared bike to zip around.
"we went to this place on a Sunday and it was over crowded. We could no enjoy due to so much of crowd. Wait time was quite long that day. If you plan to visit, avoid weekends and holiday season."
"Visited gardens by the bay (flower and cloud domes) during Christmas holiday period and it was very busy. While the gardens are interesting, it was spoiled by the number of people and lack of ability to wonder through gardens without having to navigate the crowds. We were unable to enjoy experience due to number of people blocking pathways and ended up just having quick look around. Would be better if they limited number of people allowed inside domes at one time so you could comfortably walk around and appreciate this amazing place."
Green alive show was supperb.I was trained to ensure your handicap at golf doesn't escape you need to .
"Advisable to visit both at day time and night time.Day time for the site seeing and noticing all features and night time for the light show.My advise for the first time visitors is to visit the flower dome first and then the cloud forest as the experience will be upgraded.After flower dome, the immediate entry from basement level to the cloud forest was breathtaking, which most likely you won't feel if the visit was done in other sequence.Flower dome actually can be avoided as nothing great is to offer, but that's a personal opinion after seeing it once.Carry your swimming trunks and suits for the water park / fountains on the property which seemed fun. Though same are available for buying at the property also. Except cloud forest immediate view on entrance and the water park, other things seemed average.Reason to pay a visit : not much to do for site seeing in Singapore except for few locations, and once there, why not explore all and gain own experience.ThanksAneja"
"Whilst the Gardens are nice and the entire area very interesting with lots to see and observe, the crowds were huge and not managed in a safe manner. Naturally being Christmas there are hundreds of thousands of people in the Gardens to enjoy the festivities however the crowds were not managed and at times very dangerous. It seems dollars and quantity were more important than quality and safety.Overall disappointed."
Perhaps I had bigger expectations of that trip to Gardens by the Bay than I should have. We took the tour bus and went around the gardens and although we liked the place I can't say we were very impressed.If you have an extra couple of hours on your third or fourth day then you probably should visit the gardens.
We went down to the garden by the bay for the Christmas wonderland and it was packed with tourists but it was such fun. There was an array of food stores from nachos to chicken in a cone. We had already had dinner before going through so we didn't try any of the food but the beers were cold and did flow.There was snow machine which really added to the Christmas spirit.The queues were too long to go up to the walk way to walk between the lights. I would like to go back to do this one day.
"This so called ""garden"" is highly manicured and man made, If you are a urbanite coming from a 3rd world city with an abundance of slums , this would be a garden paradise, If you come from lands where true nature is pervasive then you would find these gardens contrived and touristy . Don't go after the sun sets because finding yr way around can be a nightmare as signage is bad and lighting is dim. If you only have time for one garden, head for the Botanic Gardens instead , It's a real garden . Their fancy special shows inside the Flower dome are quite underwhelming especially if you have already seen tulips in Holland , Cherry blossoms in Japan etc"
"The gardens themselves are beautiful. They are outside, very big and free. There are volunteers to whom we can ask questions about orientation of our visits as the place is immense. We enjoyed walking outside in the gardens. But when it comes to the indoor domes, the ticket was in my opinion pretty expensive. 28 SGD per person for 2 attractions: flower dome and cloud forest. We first visited flower dome and I have to say we were disappointed. There weren't too many flowers, inside there were a big show of Christmas trees and desert plants. The cloud forest was good, with the giant waterfalls, orchid inside, nephentes plants, it was beautifully conceived, wonderful even. Before going here, we suggest you to visit first the Singapore Botanical Garden, that's free of admission and its Orchid Garden ($5 per person). In term of value for money, I found it superioir than Gardens By the Bay. Still, Gardens By The Bay is a must visit place in Singapore. Spend more time in gardens outside and cloud forest. Flower dome just see and get out, not worth it. But would we come back to Gardens By The Bay in our next visit to Singapore, probably not."
"Nice but I felt it was overrated. The place had far more people than it could handle. For the time one needs to spend inside, the F&B outlets were grossly inadequate, adding to the inconvenience. The area earmarked for the light show should have benches for sitting."
"We went to this attraction because it sounded so pretty at night with all the lights. And it was - but, you should also be aware that it is too dark to actually read all the placards about the plants, and many of the plants aren't well-lit, so although it is dramatic, it's not a great experience. My guess is that we would have enjoyed it more if we had gone during the day. It was also super crowded, but that may have been due to the Christmas displays. There were limited options for food, as well, partially because one restaurant was closed for a private party."
"We visited the cloud forest, Flower dome and the Christmas Wonderland-all were nice and colorful; however I felt it was a bit expensive for a man made attraction. The Botanic Gardens were more impressive. All attractions here are individually priced and the Christmas Supertree area is another cost. For adults there isn't much in the Christmas area-great place for some gorgeous pics of the super trees is about it."
The gardens are lovely but extremely crowded when we went late afternoon. A long way to walk and limited availability of help for people with mobility issues.Staff courteous but not much help with transport.I wouldn't recommend unless fully fit
I liked the cloud garden a lot but it really annoyed me that they had a 'winter wonderland' on and you had to pay to enter it to get to the skywalk. Even if you had no interest in the 'winter wonderland'. Then they hadn't bothered to change their signs so every direction we went in to try to get to the mrt was blocked off. Walked in circles for ages. Complained to staff who clearly couldn't care less. The ticket for the cloud garden and flower dome is expensive. The cloud garden is very impressive but the flower garden not so much (not worth the price for sure).
"It's extremely well organized and an engineering marvel - but it's not incredibly interesting or fun. Cloud forest and flower dome would be interesting if you're a gardening or flower nerd, but somewhat tedious to go through if you don't have a special interest in seeing every plant and flower on the planet. Skip it if you have anything else to do."
"Cloud garden is very special, a must see. The other flower garden was nothing special but you can buy a combo ticket for a discount to both.Gardens by the bay is extra pretty at night when the trees light up for a show!!The trees are a free attraction but you can get a $8 ticket to the skywalk for lovely views of the bay."
Unfortunately the cloud dome was not open so we only had the flower dome which was OK but average compared to Kew Gardens.The high level walk was ok but rather short.Overall a bit overrated
"A bit of an anti climax!Visit, only if you wish to say you have.Lights around trees choreographed to music."
"I visited last night with my husband, and was very disappointed in it, after all the nice restaurants in Singapore we've been to, that was the worst, it's in great need of a make over. I expected a lot better standards of where it was positioned. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends."
"It was written that it's open til 2AM but when I went there at 12 AM, it was open but was inactive and the place was too dark to even walk around. I came back without seeing anything."
Little incident happened to my visit but when we seek help from the service staff walking around the flower dome. Great support was given.
Worth a visit to escape the heat and relax a bit. Well organised and very well maintained but it will only take you about half an hour to see everything.
"This is a botanical garden of the 21st century, so most of the emphasis is on the fun, Disvey fun that is. We were astonished about the gaudy kitsch of the garden dome. All that Mickey Mouse nonsense belongs to Orchard Road, but not to a serious botanical garden.Of course the structures are a magnificnent part of architecture, The cloudy rainforest was ineteresting, but the compositions and colours of flowers were really over the top.We have no idea how the shuttle train works. Best you can do is walking from the MRT Bay.No, we will not come again"
"It was raining when we went to visit GBTB. We bought our tickets online to skip the Q but unfortunately we still need to Q to buy tickets for the shuttle. It will be much appreciated if they could have a separate counter for shuttle alone when it's raining coz they should expect a crowd during bad weather. There are some unfriendly staff. But overall, the place itself is very nice."
"So soIf u like some light show or you stay near this place, just goIf u want something unique, this place is soso"
"This is one experience which one who is looking for beautiful nature in it's many forms, must visit. It is a big garden and nothing else.. Was not very enamored."
"If you've been to Singapore you know that it's a bustling metropolis. Combine that with the extraordinary heat and humidity of being so close to the equator and you can quickly need an escape. Gardens by the Bay was that retreat for me.The public park was built as a gift to the population of Singapore as part of the deal to build the Marina Bay Sands and associated casino. While it has the normal trappings of a public park such as ponds, statues and lushl tropical gardens... prepare for a typically Singaporean twist.At the centre of the gardens the 'super trees' are vast constructions with ecology at their centre. They conceal the equipment that helps to serve the local buildings with cool air. They have solar panels for green power generation. They are planted out with diverse species of plants throughout their vast structure. So successful are these green projects, that species of birds that had long since fled Singapore have now returned to nest in their eco-cyber boughs.There is a bar at the top of one of the trees that provides stunning views across the park. You can get a similar view by taking the walk along the bridge that spans between the super trees. Be aware that these will shut during inclement weather. Due to the large amount of lightening you get in Singapore, this can be annoyingly frequent. Also, you don't get much for free in Singapore, so while exploring at ground level is free, be prepared to pay for everything else. It's for this reason that I have to drop the score.By far my best experience at the Gardens by the Bay was the nightly musical and light spectacular. The whole garden, principally lit by the magnificent super trees pulse in a choreographed mix of colourful lights that match the accompanying music. Make sure that you look it up, I was surprised by the number of people, even locals, who didn't know about this (absolutely free) event."
"Another tour booked thru Viator. Offers hotel pickup and transportation to Gardens by the Bay, Super Tree light show and sound show, admission to the Observation Deck at Marina Sands, river cruise and transport back to hotel. Long que for the lift back down so be patient."
Mixed feelings. On one hand great achivement to build a garden on land reclaimed from the sea with great effort and cost. On the other full of plastic cartoon personalities and quirky music from hidden speakers ( jingle bells on 4th of November?) and tons of people. Nice views though.
Nice place to visit. Great outing for families. Easy to get to. Prices to get into cordoned off gardens a bit over the top
"At a distance, these are a sight to behold, with massive domes rising into the skyline. Up close, to us, these were a little less impressive with a distinct lack of clear directions around the flower done and unbelievably poorly policed queueing system in place to get to the top of done in the cloud dome. The flower dome was full of young girls taking endless selfies giving no consideration for anybody actually interested in the plants. Unfortunately we left a little underwhelmed."
Nicely constructed on a unique concept....preferable to go during evening as most of the area is in open...also there is a light show near by daily at 8 pm and 9 pm...which you can see after exploring the gardens
If you are flower or cactus lover you can visit Garden by the Bay since there are many species of fauna can be found there. You can also enjoy cloud forest main attraction is waterfall.Overall it is good place for picture but for me this place was overrated. Just my personal opinion.
"Pleasant and nice environment. Good for photographers. Unfortunately it's all fake. The current exhibits is limited. Toilets are few and have to walk quite a distant before you can locate one and no signages to lead you, keep having to asked the staff for directions. Best saving grace is that locals gets a special rate, kudos to that."
This is nice place to hang out in the evening time. Especially the light and sound program is nice to watch.
It was very enjoy full visit to garden but main problem we faced was improper direction and information board placed at site. Should management look to the subject. It will be a big help for tourists.
Else you can skip it. I didn't find it interesting and felt bored. I don't have much interest in flowers. You may skip this actually.
Quite disappointed with the sunflower show. The flowers looked very tired and was expecting them to be a lot taller. Not sure it was worth the money.Signs around the park itself are very confusing to find places to eat.
"I had read all the hype about the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome so was really looking forward to them. I battled the crowds, lined up for a ticket, and lined up to enter the Flower Dome. The first section was an Australian garden. It looked like my own garden. Then there was daisies, azaleas, orchids, sunflowers .... all things that I see in my own garden, neighbours' gardens, Flower Power, Bunnings ... I can appreciate that other cultures and societies don't have such flowers - and I could see the joy that the flowers were bringing to the other visitors - but I was honestly disappointed. I then went to the Cloud Dome and walked in to see the artificial waterfall. It was well done and looked beautiful - but I've seen heaps of waterfalls in the national parks back home - in particular in the Blue Mountains. So I didn't even bother lining up to go to the top of the waterfall - instead I found the exit and left."
They have grown all kinds of plants - saw the pitcher plant live first time. The walkways on the top and falls are awesome. 28 SGD per adult I thought is steep for that - hey but Singapore is an expensive city indeed. The outdoor park is also nice the lighting show is worth a visit - 7:45 PM and 8:45 PM shows
"We visited the Gardens by the Bay in the evening in order to catch the much talked about Sound and light show at the Supertree Grove, which starts at 7 45 pm.The show itself did not live up to the hype or our expectations. What's worse is that as the show ended, the crowds started to leave the area in a completely haphazard manner.It was dark and there were no clear signages telling us which way to leave the complex. As a result, lots of people were queuing up and looking confused. There were no staff to guide us either, but we eventually managed to find our way by following the crowds to the Bayfront MRT station, which is almost a 20 minute walk away!Overall not a pleasant experience, especially if you are planning to go with small kids. You don't want to get lost in a crowded place, in the dark!"
We went at 530pm and the wait for the elevator up was so crowded that we had to wait 30 minutes. They should really install staircases.
"A spacious outdoor environment suitable for family bondingGood for morning and evening exerciseHowever, need to pay extra to see the indoor waterfall and flower exhibitions"
The architecture is interesting and the variety of plants quite surprising; thoughthe films and explsnations about the whole project and its planning are what we most liked; very instructive and eye opening also for teens; 1 max 2 hours are sufficient ; the castel and other decoration items do not quite fit though
"The gardens look much more attractive in photos. But when you go visit, they are relatively small and you don't get the wow factor in the outside grove..We went late so tickets were closed for cloud forest and flower dome so we had to visit the outside garden. Also saw the light show.Overall Recommend to Skip if you have missed the time to see cloud forest and flower dome."
"Sign board that use to direct visitors to exist need some improvement at Flower Dome. Not only my self, I saw tourist is been mislead too."
Quite average visit and my parents quite tired after visit... I planning to buy family package but I only 1 child so not worth it. Hope can get the cheaper family package for annual pass
"HINT: signup for the Sands loyalty programme to get a discount on some of the attractions here. We paid $78 for 3 people for both the garden and cloud attractions. Both take about 40 mins to go around.As an achievement they are something, with self sustaining climates in a country on the equator, but I wasn't all that interested in what was on offer.In the gardens the theme was Wizard of Oz, and there was an odd mix of Willy wonka (60's) style sets with real flowers. Definitely something different.The cloud venue was more subtropical, but the kicker at the top of the climb was that the plants were made of LEGO...Both popular with folks and busy, but cooler than the heat outside!"
Unusual and worth the visit however try and avoid the times when the masses from the nearby MBS hotel descend upon it.
Not much as I expected.evenings are better when lights are on.don't miss the light show.visited both domes.i was a bit disappointed.there is scope to take lots of photos.just a garden with many flowers and plants.
"If you never experienced with Garden by the bay, then you can go to have a look :) I been there twice, it mostly same with last time. Overall good."
Entry is not cheap (for tourists). It was packed during the weekend and felt more like an amusement park. The surrounding (and open) gardens are lovely and serene - but without A/C.
"It's over rated , I did not feel that the plants were really real . The view was good . Not ready worth spending that money ."
"We paid $26 Singaporean dollars to do the tree too walk. Yes the view was breathtaking but the walk was very short. It was not what I expected based on other tree top walks I have been on however, if you haven't been on others, this may be a good starting point. The children got bored very quickly and ran to the end."
"as garden, is a beautiful place, if you are looking for show, this took only 15 mins, and pay a lot of money for this."
We visited gardens by the bay on a Saturday evening. Reached there by 5 p.m. tickets at counter we're 28$ a piece. We got ours from an agent in Chinatown for 16. You have to walk a lot . The cloud forest and flower park are good but only one time visit. The light show at the end is good.choose a place wisely to see the trees light
"Would be more eager to have visited a zoo. This place is beautiful but it doesn't excite you at any point of the trip. I haven't chosen a ticket to climb up the light trees, maybe you can enjoy the view on there but the domes were not shockingly nice."
We never actually went to Gardens by the Bay. The view from Marina Bay Sands as we looked down upon the gardens was beautiful enough. Plus we enjoyed the entire light show at night from the comforts of our balcony.
"Gardens by the Bay is a popular attraction in Singapore, and while there are a couple of nice components, overall I found it to be vastly overrated.It is a nice enough place to spend an hour or two if you are in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip for it.TIP: Don't visit if you have recently been to Kew Gardens, England."
"We went for a quick afternoon wander around the gardens and found it very akin to a theme park. Staff recommended we spend 45-60mins in each dome (which have seperate entry fees) so being time poor we opted to just visit the Cloud Forest ($8 fee). There was not much to see between the attractions, and the views from the Cloud Forest were nice (you could see the F1 track as well as looking out over the bay), with the added bonus of a breeze being so high up. That said, I would not go again and the views from the top of MBS are better."
"Visited cloud forest. It's an artificially created ecosystem. Air conditioning and water droplets spray creates a mood of highland. Waterfall has been created artificially. One of the must visit place in Singapore. The drawback is that everything is man made. If you want to enjoy the nature's real beauty, then it's not recommended. Last but not least there is another ecosystem along with cloud forest, that is flower dome. Flower done is not recommended."
I'm not a plant/tree person but my husband wanted to visit. There is lots to see but you have to pay to go into the domes which costs $28 dollars. The gift shops are lovely with unusual gifts and at reasonable prices.
not so impressed. Actually I feel it was a mere tourist attraction on the inside but from outside it was very nice
"Nice and cool environment. Different flowers and trees, but not realy worth the money in my opinion. Gardens around the indoor part just as nice to visit."
"A very nice place to visit. So beautiful. But I suggest maybe u can lower the ticket price. Somemore, the food court (Satay of the Bay) is quite far from the main entrance. Easy to get cab from the park. Anyway, two thumbs up."
Been here with kids... U need a hardcore enthusiastic person to enjoy such places.. while intial 15-20 mins i enjoyed but then gotten bored to see various plants or trees which u cannot differentiate much.
Not so exciting. But it's OK to visit once. The cloud forest and flower display was good. But the rest of it is ok
If you love nature and into flowers perhap u gonna love this place. Come between 5-8 pm so you can experience both during the day and night . Easy access by public transport . Use mrt .
The cost of taking a family (parents and 2 kids) would be quite prohibitive. We purchased discounted tickets (though only slightly cheaper) through KLOOK but cannot say that it was value for money really. Best time to visit is dusk to night time and the viewing of the Supertrees (synchronised to music) was the highlight of the visit. I reckon this and the OCBC skywalk are the two best options for the GBTB.
Though built with a lot of conviction the place is only good for people who live in Singapore. Being from a country like India with so much of REAL wildlife and waterfall and plants it did not impress me one bit as most of the plants shown are artificial. Yes some good replica are there like that of rafflesia Venus flytrap but I was not n impressed. I must say I did not visit gardens due to shortage of time but this was was ordinary and if misssed nothing that you should regret.
"Very crowded especially we aimed to see the lighting for the kids. It's slightly inconvenience to us with strollers yet inconsiderate visitors all rushed in to the lifts. And there's only 2 lifts, perhaps a signage or a note to the visitors to use stairs and escalator and giving the space to the one with wheels. Nothing special about the lighting, yet its packed with tourist and locals."
"Would have been a great visit if it wasn't so busy, queues to get in the conservatories and the skywalk of over 1 hour. Once inside it is a beautiful place to visit. Didn't get to the top of the skywalk as the queue was too long."
"Beautiful flowers and cooling dome, suitable for all ages (young and old).See the variety of flowers from different nation."
"I went on a Monday, thinking that there would be less people around. However, when I arrived, it felt very much like a weekend with simply hordes of tourists and visitors. Then I found out when I was buying my ticket that the Cloud Forest Dome was closed for maintenance. So I was left with only the other option, the Flower Dome.This proved a mistake as there was, firstly, inane muzak piping on a loop non-stop which was extremely irritating. Secondly, there were way too many people-again, concentrated in a single, closed setting.All in all, the visit was spoilt for me, despite the interesting plants and flowers in an air-conditioned setting.Then, it was off to the overhead walkway and after shelling out S$8, went up with a whole elevator load of people with their babies and children and pushcarts.If you think you will find peace and quiet here, this is definitely NOT the place for it.There was also surprisingly very little varied bird life in the outside areas. I saw the ubiquitous mynahs, pigeons, crows and doves. With a Sunda Pygmy Woodpecker-which made my day; and water monitor lizard thrown in for good measure.I would suggest the Management provides means for public feedback to make much needed improvements.An experience not to be repeated."
it's a must to visit place in Singapore. good place to hangout and observe the light show. you can even have a walk on the high bridge.
"If you come here when there is no special event, there were no decoration so the place looks flat and have nothing except the flower. Come here near Christmas maybe to get a more colorful and lively place."
advisable to visit this place in the evening until 8/9 pm for LED show.staff were friendly and advised us to wait until night for the show.long walk.. please use suitable shoes
"The entrance to the Visitor Centre need to be improved greatly.The entrance is just at the traffic junction with 1 lane turning left to the entrance of Visitor Centre.And if you keep left, the lane will lead to the basement carpark gantry entrance. If keep right, driver has to ""fight"" for lane with vehicles turning right from the junction from the opposite carriageway.This access road is heavily congested as the tourist coach buses and taxi also enter from this entrance.Just after the basement carpark entrance is the drop-off point and further front is the taxi stand and coaches/tour bus drop-off.Garden By The Bay need to improve on the traffic management and location of the various vehicle type drop-off point to avoid congestion."
Great attraction only if you have seen all of the Singapore attractions or there is special promotion for this rather costly visit to domes with air conditioned greenhouse.
"Very long queue to enter the domes. However, the staff are very helpful and the crowd was manged well. Despite the long queue, the queue was quite fast."
"First time visit to Garden for the Flower show. The location is not anywhere 'By the Bay' and is a fair walk from the mrt station.The Orchids on display was nice and a great variety. However, the flower dome is not a really big place so spending an hour there taking photos is good enough. Can't say much about the other type of flowers... the Kangaroos paw was quite ordinary and the Hydrangeas a disappointment. Nothing much unusual.Moreover, the ticket price is too expensive, considering that you can also see a great variety of Orchids for free at the nurseries or Orchid farms. The only difference is that flowers at the Gardens are nicely arranged for photo taking and is in an air-cond place, away from the hot sun.The Cloud forest requires a separate ticket but it only has a man-made waterfall."
The plants do change over season. Depending on the Holidays like Christmas or Chinese New Year or even Festivals.
"It might have helped to have nice weather, but after spending a couple hours at the gorgeous botanical garden and not wanting to pony up the expensive entrance fee for the domes, there wasn't much to see beyond the supertree grove.Had some good food at a decent price at the Satay by the Bay centre in the park."
"Worth going to it is interesting but very busy and probably only worth going at night for the lights show, if you can leave early to escape the crowds but is very pretty!"
"The gardens themselves are lovely, the unfortunate thing was we were in Singapore on a short turnaround in the middle of summer holidays. It was Absolutly packed you just stood in queues everywhere trying to dodge people taking 'selfies' by the thousand. What they do with all the selfies is anybody's guess but take them they will. The kids splash zone is good for a cool off though for the little ones. Price is ok but it's not really value forMoney as you get swept along by the huge throng of people and can't stop to fully appreciate it.Glad we have been but won't be going back(unless it's off season and empty)"
"Compare to two years back, the flower concept are more and nicer but arrangementfrom the management were good."
The construction of the cloud forest and garden dome is very impressive. It's unclear why so many cheesy elements are added. The natural wood sculptures fit in nicely.
"Amazing technologies, however:-1) No surau provided for Muslim visitors.2) Hard to find dustbins to throw rubbish.3) No variation of halal foods, only Texas Chicken.3)"
Got huge collection of flowers/trees from all over the world under one roof. But always crowded and not clear direction.
"I prefer natural surroindings. These Gardens are too interested in techno and bling. We took the driverless car, which was fun, but found the food outlets poor and the layout confusing."
We visited the Super tree structures. It looks impressive from afar but not so great from near or from within.We went during the day. Apparently there is lighting in it at night
"save yourself the taxi fare of heading down to this pace (although taxis are the only thing that is good value in Singapore) and go to the botanic gardens instead. They are much larger, have much more variety and are actually real."
Good view and very relaxing place in a good weather condition. Drinking fountain however isnt working
The light show was really enjoyable but I the other attraction that we paid to see were disappointing
This place is beautifully made but nothing much to do. Full Marks to SIngapore for this but I am not much for a Garden Person. Would prefer shopping or a beach
"Decent views, it's free. Near marina bay sands. Big place, you need to pay to enter specific area..."
"nice to walk around the flowers and gardens, also temperature is good! t is ok and a nice place to visit but not cheap!"
"We were not overly impressed with this place. It is a giant indoor garden which, although pretty, didn't have anything special going for it other than size. It is located in the park right across the street from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. if you have extra time, stop by, but I wouldn't go out of my way."
"Went there for a visit with my family during Xmas season to have a look at the seasonal flowers. Overall quite good. Able to take lots of nice shots. Xmas village is excluded from the main tickets. You need purchase separately. However, I don't find the Xmas village worth your money. Besides some lighting decor and expensive game booth and rides. You don't really find much worth. Better off at the main gardens. Not a place that kids will enjoy much if you are not prepared to pay for some rides."
Only the OCBC skywalk was good. Flower Dome and and the other things was boring. I am not a flower fan. Could be interesting for garden lovers.
"Wow this is seriously spectacular and very worth a visit. The only concern is how busy it is with bus loads of families coming in for the light shows in the evening. The logistics for getting a cab is a nightmare with buses blocking all entry points so no cabs can get close.Lots of areas for refreshments but doesn't cater well for the unbelievable number of ageing people requiring wheelchairs. There are so many interesting areas, hard to take in during one evening, give yourself one night and a day to enjoy properly without being crowded and rushed.So beautiful though a credit to Singapore"
It's a nice stop for a one-time experience (day/night) but especially at night for the musical lights show.
Need interactive display. More helping and visitor friendly staff required. More hype than reality. It's certainly a display worth a visit. Gift shop is over priced and so is the food in prema cafe
"It was a nice walk around the gardens but knowing this was one of the best tourist attractions in Singapore kind of makes you think... what am I doing here... there isn't much to do in Singapore and it is an extremely expensive country, even in relation to Australia, my advice is transit through KL, HK or BKK... Singapore isnt worth the effort."
Place is big and the dome comes with aircond. So disappointed no much types of flowers to see. Can't even find sunflower. Everywhere u see is just green colors. Even if there is flower is very normal and small. Was hoping to see more big colorful flowers
It's an ok place for an evening visit.Actually it's rated highly which actually it is not.There is only one light show and that too an ok ok thing.The staff are courteous and helpful.I suggest if u planning to visit please reach early as its heavily crowed at the time of light show and the place to watch it from is not that gud.
"The garden best viewed at night, with colorful lights, and beautiful city lights surrounding the area. But sometimes get too crowded, and too hot to walk and to enjoy. Perhaps better to visit late at night when not so many people come."
An islet built on reclaimed land from the sea. A lake to walk round with loads of aquatic plants. It is a free tourist destination to admire loads of greenery. A safe place to have a long stroll.
Gardens by the Bay is ok to visit. We visited late in the evening to enjoy the lights and sounds show. There's not much to do here other than enjoying green plants and lights show.
Heard a lot about the gardens back home and when i did a tour it was very disappointing. Super trees galore and a light show. Maybe it was the tour I did but the emphasis was on the Super Trees which are man made trees with foliage covering them. Light and sound show was ok but not really a lot of gardens to see. Probably an hour or so in total spent here which was plenty. A lot of money was spent apparently on these gardens and probably money best spent elsewhere.
"When I told people I was intending to visit Singapore this was one of the places that was highly recommended. So despite my horticultural prowess peaking at running a mower over a lawn I decided to pay a visit.We went on a Saturday morning, it was not overcrowded and the staff we encountered were helpful and pleasant.In layman's terms this was a visit to two big green houses. The smell inside the domes is very pleasant and the aircon makes it a refuge from the intense Singapore heat. It took us just over an hour to walk around both domes. I'm sure some horticulturalists could get lost for hours in here but for us it was nothing more than a pleasant walk through the air conditioned greenery. I've been once and that will be enough for me."
"This is an artificial Garden smack in middle of the City. You are in awe of the man-made creation but lacks the effect and impact of a natural beauty and wilderness you get to see in other parts of world. Its very informative and kids love it. Wooden shapes of animals / birds are done very well and the entire garden is designed ascetically. Take a shawl / light jacket with you especially during summer, its very cold in the domes."
"One of those showcase projects for which Singapore is famous. Everything created artificially this century.Two large greenhouses showcasing flora from two different climates. Visitors need to pay separately to go into each greenhouse.Another showcase items, some tall artificial ""Trees"". Again, you need to pay to walk along the bridge joining them.In keeping with the image they're trying to project, there is a restaurant, ""Pollen"" attached to the greenhouses where a set dinner will set you back about S$200 per head.Clearly targeted at tourists. Locals will likely visit the garden once out of curiosity.If Botany and local flora be your interesst, a much better bet is the 150 year old Botanic Gardens opposite the US Embassy. All natural!"
"It's a nice place if you like manmade nature ' enjoy nature while indoors in a controlled environment. Unfortunately, it's not my cup of tea."
Nothing much interesting only during christmas it seems to be better with those lightings inside deco........the rest..waste of time and money
Came here as one of the top attractions for Singapore but was disappointed. Very artificial and expensive.
"the big trees are really nice, especially at night, but the domes are completely not worth the ticket price - everything looks very fake and tacky. just go there in the evening and visit only the free part, that's the best option."
"This is my second visit to these conservatoriums. Unfortunately I didn't realise this particular Sunday was Father's Day. The floral dome was colourful, beautiful but crowded. The rainforest cloud dome with the waterfall was manic and unbearable. Once inside, the queues to go up started right back by the waterfall. An employee told me it's best to visit on a week day and on dusk as they have pretty night lighting."
"Great for families,teenagers,couples,babies and it is a wheelchair accessible place.Therefore,it is suitable for everyone.Great place to take pics and its one of the most famous and picturesque places in SG.We can see many different kinds of flowers and crystals which are very pretty.And yes,tickets are needed to enter the two domes...Cloud forest and flower dome."
"For visitors, it's great place to go at least once when they are in Singapore. However, for locals, it's expensive for a family to go outing for a day when there is special event being hosted. Recommended to go once but not frequent."
"If you are fond of various plants and flowers, this is a great place to see seasonal flowers. We went there the second time and saw various tulips displays. I believe we visited on a holiday and the place is packed with people so it's hard to enjoy the scenery. If you want to visit the place, go on a weekday and early in the morning. We were no able to see the entire facility due to long lines and late in the afternoon. The entrance fee is quite pricey if you don't get to enjoy the place due to crowding."
"Bringing tulips to Garden by the Bay brightened up the exhibit. However, the other non-Dutch plants don't blend well with the Tulip.The transformation should be complete rather than partial"
"Went to Gardens by the bay 2-3 times a year but the most recent visit, i was a bit disappointed. Almost all the flowers / cactus are the same as past few months. Only small area has new flowers such as lily etc but can see that some flowers were drying up. Hopefully can have more changes in flowers.No 'WOW' feeling after visiting more than 1 time a year. If majority of flowers keep on repeating, i'm afraid sooner or later, tourists will be tired of seeing same flowers repeatedly. This is the 2nd time i brought my overseas friends to Gardens by the bay. They also find not much changes in the flowers except small portion with new seasonal flowers. Moreover, the cactus area remains the same since last year. My overseas friends been there twice and will not go 3rd time because really no major changes."
"Came here with high expectations for the afternoon lightshow but was a bit dissapointed. Although the lightshow is well coordinated, and overall fun to look at, I was not blown away by it all."
Was told I had to go here. It was impressive even though it wasn't really my cup of tea. Some of the displays were simply amazing.
"We visited gardens by the bay after visiting the botanical gardens the day before. My preference was the botanical gardens. Whilst the gardens are lovely and well kept, it lacks a real nature feel, and wasn't a whole lot to look at. Probably better for families. Gets busier as the day goes and further takes away the natural feel."
"It's a well made garden, with a lot of walk. Yes the trees and plants here are well curated and not easy to grow, all in all I really respect the effort gone in this but if you are on a tight itinerary and unless you're into gardens you could probably strike this one out of your list, having said that if gardens is your thing then this is the benchmark of garden-tech."
I visited here two years ago. That time this venue was a new attraction. This year many people were there. Too many.. it was not bad but I missed more quiet and clean Gardens by the Bay. The light show was as good as the past's.
"I went to both Botanic Gardens and Gardens of the Bay today. After to have walked + scooted around both parks (even tho it wasnt allowed sometimes) I must say I enjoyed the Botanic Gardens more. Due to the fact that its a REAL garden/park definitly adds a lot of worth. Asides from all the trees, woods, forrests etc there were also big green grassy areas where you could just sit down and relax. I didnt notice any of that in Gardens of the Bay.It was also more quit and peacefull in the Botanic Gardens and it smelled fresher.Note, in neither parks did i visit the paid sections so i cant give a review on that..."
"I have heard so many great things about Gardens by the Bay and so I spent the money for the tickets which I thought was a bit pricey but figured it would be worth it...I was very surprised to find that it was so much concrete... What kind of garden is that?It started to really bother me because the gardens claim to be environmentally conscious however there is just so much unneeded, brought in material to a place that is beautiful for nature not construction.I found the attractions really boring. After about an hour I really wanted to just leave and go do something else. Unless you're really fascinated by botany, it's probably just going to be a quick stop.I hate to leave an average review on one of the highest rated gardens of the world but I have seen gardens in New Zealand, kept by personal property that had more magic happening than this tourist attraction."
A really beautiful place with very nice gardens landscaped. There are many type of flowers to see and one can spend at least half a day there. Some of the gardens need entrance tickets
Dont go in the morning you will get dismayed as the towering tree looks plain also the burning heat will make you sit and stay in just one place rather than roaming around the garden. Do visit at night cause this is when the garden comes to life but very artificial. This is something I would not be really keen on visiting it just happened to be near Marina Bay Sanda that's why we had a quick stop. But seriously the heat will make you get out of there really quick.
The waterfall was the highlight - not a huge variety of flowers compared to botanical gardensIt was nice to escape the humidity but was disappointed with the variety of colour in the gardens
"Its a really nice place with lots of scenic attractions and most importantly lots of greenery. Its a good place for children and its a cool place, especially with the heat in Singapore during the months of April, May and June"
We visited the two artificial domes (flower & cloud) at the Gardens By the Bay area. To cover these two attractions and the light show (around 7 pm) in the evening one needs 1/2 day. Flower dome is better than Cloud Dome. Nothing great in Cloud Dome. And if you plan to visit National Orchid Garden then you can skip the Flower Dome too. Better to go to Gardens By the bays area just to watch the evening light show. And if you have very less time then watch the laser light show at Marina Bay Sands rather than watching the light show at the Gardens By the Bay area. Marina Bay Sands laser show is MUST WATCH !
"Free Garden Rhapsody show from 7.00pm to 8.45pm at Supertree grove.Wonderful, beautiful, light and sound show."
Wheelchair friendly.However does not have many benches for resting in the indoor facilities.Was swamped with other massive organisation outing without control.
"Walked from Marina Bay Sands to the gardens and found we were in a children's event! Gardens also surrounded by building work and not all areas accessible. Walkway and trees closed due to the possibility of lightning!Paid to go into the two domes. The cloud dome is the best, but is very crowded but very good apart from the plastic rocks which are very poor!Flower Dome is ok but a bit repetitive.The walked to see the barrage and had lunch at Satay which is a Singapore Street market.Overall ok"
"We had wanted to view the light show, so decided to arrive 2 hours early and use our City Sightseeing pass to go into the Conservatories (Cloud Forest and Flower Conservatory).The conservatories weren't worth the money or the time.We went into the Cloud Forest first, waiting 30 minutes to go inside (which we thought was a pretty good waiting time), only to find that when we got inside there was another hour and a half wait to go in the lift to the walkways. We would have missed the light show if we had waiting in line, so decided to just walk around the 'ground floor' which took a grand total of 7 minutes.We then went into the Flower Conservatory which was fine, but the displays were being changed so most of the flowers/hanging baskets were just on the floor (yet we still paid full price!). Especially not worth it if you're English because you'll find most of the flowers in your garden (minus a palm tree or two).Regardless, the light show was absolutely stunning and we would absolutely watch this again.In short, save your money and just watch the free light show."
"I was asking myself what if one day this type of garden the only kind of 'nature 'our children know. More and more people seem to have smart ways to justify it. They may say, this is important for environment, for knowledge, for humanity etc. Humongous Air-conditioned to support so these plants alive! I do not really know.Giant roof of glass, fake water falls, either for our knowledge or more for photo opportunities, I doubt if I will take my children to this 'gardens'. I cannot speak for others, even I had disagreement with my wife on this subject. I hope people will build less this kind of 'amusement park'. I personally hope there will be less faking nature acts in future and the real cost of this will not be billed to future generation."
"We went here for a side trip after a long day seminar but we were able to catch up with the forest cloud which is so amazing. They organize flowers vertically. The mist, the stones, the secret garden was just Amazing. We don't have time to see the Flower Dome for the time being but was able to catch up the lighting at the Supertree Grove that was so magical! Everything was just so worth to our uncomfortable sweating because of the humidity. I will definitely come back again!"
"We arrived at 7:30pm, so could only enter 1 dome. On advice we went to cloud forest, tbh, people had said it was so amazing etc, but we thought it was a bit over rated for 16 s$ each.I liked the outside ' light up' trees that are free and the walks ways etc. It was just the cloud dome, wasn't as good as we expected,there were more artificial things inside than we thought there would be.I felt it was a bit of an educational place, rather than a tourist attraction, so that's why only the 3 *, as I'm a visitor."
"It's next to the Marina Bay hotel, so we wandered over, found it nice and relaxing, decided to go into the Cloud Forest Dome. It was OK. Wanted to come back at night and go up to the Super Tree Grove. The bar and restaurant opens until midnight. That would be a good way to see the city lights, but we never made it. Next time."
I guess if you are a keen gardener or really interested in flora and fauna then this is the place to go. Otherwise its ok worth an hour or two to walk around. Would love to have seen it at night but no time. Also they closed the skywalk because of rain so would have liked to have tried that too.
"This is THE selfie taking attraction. We were a bit annoyed walking around. I wouldn't come here if you don't LOVE plants. We don't, but we thought ""we HAVE to see this."" Well, it didn't make us like it more. Plants are plants even if you have to pay to see them"
"Gardens are great but you have to walk. There are buggies but you can't hire them and the ones you can catch stop running at five! For over 100 hectares and the heat, this is beyond stupid.Gardens are free but you have to pay for skywalk, flower garden and cloud forest. The latter was closed when we visited but no reduction in price.Queues for various things are good but take water as there is only mobile wagon and they are not at all friendly, in fact downright rude."
Slow walk at night must be best time on singapore gardens by the bay.It safe and full of fun.That singapore for.
"Love the flower dome inside have lot of different species flower and cactus!! Overall still ok~ just sometimes too much annoying kids and baby trolley~! To those parents, PLS~!! This is not playground for kids~!!"
If you are interested in flowers this is the place to be the flower dome otherwise it is not for you. The cloud forest was interesting and good.
"I have visited Gardens by the bay multiple times, but this is the first time i am disappointed. The Tulip gardens inside the Dome have already bloomed. If you are looking for a beautiful flower trip, you should have gone few weeks ago."
"At first I was so excited when my aunt told me that there was Tulip festival at Gardens by The Bay. Though I've ever been there two times before, but me and my sisters were so excited. But when we reached there, it was not as cold as before. And the flowers were dried."
"Flower n fauna enthusiasts will surely have a blast hereFlowers from different parts of the world grow in controlled climatic conditionsSouth African forest, Brazilian rain forest,etcThemes arranged amongst the flowers for perfect group and selfie photosThe flowers emanate a smell which too few maybe pleasant others may get nauseousWould have loved a little description just by the sideThe dome is beautifully arranged ,flowers are pretty ,bright ,vivacious and dazzling colours hold your eyeThe flower dome ,cloud forest ,moonlight adventure and marina bay shoppes and walk along marina bay can be completed in a single evening if you can reach by 4.30 pmCatch an mrt or bus transport ,it's convenient and fastThe kids do get bored after a while ,so there's an ice cream shop outside ,try the salted caramel ,red velvet flavoursSouvenir shop after coming outside"
They are so excited during the annual trip.They are hope to have an organize again by next year...We try of our best to serve with the trip and be... perfect for the trip..
"Perhaps we were spoiled by the more secluded Singapore Botanic Gardens the day before, but I found Gardens by the Bay to be a little too touristy for my taste. Don't get me wrong; it was very nice and worth visiting, but the hype is a bit much for what you get. My advice is to go ahead and do this, but also see the Singapore Botanic Gardens and, if you can, hike to the ""Tree Top Walk"" (monkeys!) for a truly incredible Singapore experience."
Too busy for me. We waited in line for nearly an hour just to get into the waterfall dome so by the time we finished there we couldn't be bothered doing the flower dome because it was just as busy.Best thing is just walk around the outdoor gardens.
It's quite scenic place with a wide variety of flowers and vegetation in the middle of the city. It would be a place that you would visit just once unless you love flowers etc.
"This is my 2nd trip. Got tickets to both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. The Tulipmania (in Flower Dome) is currently one of the new attractions, available for only a month. Everything was nice, but not particularly amazing. Still worth a trip if you haven't been there. If you have already visited the place once, will suggest just buying the ticket for the Flower Dome. The weather is hot if you decide to walk from Bayfront MRT station, so please be prepared."
It fell a bit short of my expectations as last years Tulip mania for far far better than this one. This seems to have been hurriedly put together as we could see bulbs at places too.
"Very disappointed! The one night we had a chance to see the Super Trees light up and they where only partially on, the website states open till 2am while the others close at 9pm. Otherwise the area in general during the day is beautiful and we visited the Cloud Forrest."
"The weather was not so good, so we decided to wonder around the Gardens by the Bay. It is like Paradis. Amazing to see the variety of plants they organised in one place. I liked the Cloud Forest better then the flower Dome. The last one was overcrowded, and we could hardly move around, let alone to look at the flowers. Guess it depends on the time slot you are visiting. If you don't bother the crows, a good attraction."
"Good to see, but I think no need to buy ticket, just buy ticket for marina bay skypark, view is awesome from there"
"Although a major Singapore attraction, I am not into gardens and flowers so did not enjoy the flower dome. The cloud forest was good and the skywalk between the trees was great."
I think it's absolutely wrong that foreigners are charged a much higher entrance fee to visit Gardens by the Bay. In my opinion it's discrimination.
Many of the plants on 'display' or from European and/or Western Regions and consequently the temperature in the facility is a bit chill (be aware when going in with little children)
"We went to Gardens by the Bay twice in the evenings. There is a nice atmosphere during the light show, but the show itself is nothing special. The first time we went was quite late in the evening and we almost had the place to ourselves which was great as you can go at your own pace without it being packed. Worth seeing once if you're visiting Singapore for the first time."
"It's a photographers dream to come here, come at night as it's really beautiful to look at. It's a small walk but worth it."
"It's great grandeur.Any way because of too crowded on Saturday afternoon, It's make me rather upset."
It was gardens and it was by the bay. It was nothing more and nothing less. Not exactly the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. I can't be enthusiastic about it.
too many people there. and it was a bit cold... There could be some temperature warming somewhere to help people get prepared.
"Was hoping to catch the sakura flowers blooming but was a bit disappointed as the place was overcrowded and the flowers are not so grant as expected. However if you are an admirer of flowers, then this should not be a stop to skip."
It was rather dull. I went to the flower dome to see the sakura flowers but it was withering and almost dying. The place was extremely crowded also but we went on a weekend so can't do anything about that.
The Sakura theme did not live up to expectation in my opinion. There wasn't much Sakura trees and and the the booth at the centre offer a very small variety of Japanese theme goods and stuff.
"For the Cloud Forest, the visit direction is fixed and need to go out and re-enter to visit if got some places missed out. A bit inconvenient."
A beautiful experience of world flowers in one dome. I got to see Sakura cherry blossom and its tradition and culture.
Beautiful but crowded - we cut our viewing short due to the fact that crowd control measures (cattle grids) inside the venues prevented us from actually viewing the plants on multiple occasions. Our fault for going during peak season!
"I know it is an amazing place ,but when compared to Universal or Sentosa or any other major attraction.it was not exciting enough. The cloud forest is amazing,and even Garden By the Bay is must visit if you are a plant enthusiast."
Very nice view at night. You can enjoy peace and tranquility. You can get good food and good experience here.
mountain people during sakura season. cant take very well picture in flower dome. please add more sakura
"It's really too crowded, long long queue for every point. I am my old parents, can't stand and queue for so long. End up half way left. So sad to disappointed them."
I was excited when my daughter presented both my hubby and i with two tickets - Flower Dome and Cloud forest. Flower Dome was great. But i was rather disappointed that Cloud forest had not changed much.
"Hi, noticed that the sakura this year is not really in abundance. Wish there are more displays of sakura trees around flower dome."
"Experiencing cheery blossoms in Flower dome was indeed eventful and exciting, with only crowd control the minus point of this experience."
Gardens by the bay is ok...isn't worth raving about like every man and his dog does. Some unique flowers however can get very crowded. We were very pissed off when we bought a bottle of water at the shop to take with us walking around and you couldn't take it in. We had to scull it. Very stupid rules. Ticketing system through travel agents for these tickets are an absolute nightmare so don't buy through your travel agent- buy when you get to the door. We won't be back- been there done that
"There are several gardens/parks in this area and if you're a first-timer, it's not always easy to determine what it is you want to see. Fortunately there are emplyoees in the lines to the ticket counters who can help you determine if you are indeed in the correct line.We appreciated this covered park mostly because of its relatively cool temperature; it also has a great selection of succulents. The designs are a bit kitschy but are probably a big hit with kids, who would enjoy a stay of about half an hour."
"If you don't like heights, probably best not to do this as you need to walk over a high narrow bridge. A pleasant temperature and interesting plants. The attraction kept us busy for about 3 hours and a great view of Marina Bay Sands."
"While this visit for the light show was nice, for a 15 minute show that is really just flashing lights set to the musical scores of some big-name movies it is just that - a light show."
"This is a must visit place in Singapore, however, it needs sorting out.The focus should be on plants yet too often other distractions get in the way. For example in the Flower Dome there is a profusion of bad art everywhere. By 'bad art' I mean tacky and irrelevant artworks placed around and among the plants. What a travesty.Someone needs to take this place back to its core purpose before it disappears under the kitsch."
"One of the features of the Singapore skyline, the Gardens by the Bay super trees are a notable element of the Gardens by the Bay. There are public gardens, a multi-storey Cloud forest (easily accessible via lifts, escalators, etc.) and a large low-level flower dome. There is a light show (not amazing) in the evening.The Cloud Forest features a large waterfall and an ambling walk around the perimeter of lush tropics, green gardens. There are some interesting stalactite's and stalagmites on display (wonder how they were removed from their original sports and transported!), and interest sculptures fashioned from polished and worked timber.We were perhaps unlucky with the timing of our visit to the Flower dome as they were readying it for what promised to be a very busy cherry blossom festival and we were left with displays being reworked and some pretty dreary and uninteresting displays.There was also a big function on in the function room which is part of the Flower Dome and the high-tech presentations taking place didn't add to the atmosphere. Also the skywalk wasn't operating.It's an expensive visit and while it was worth seeing it wouldn't be on the ""see-again"" list unless there was a very significant special exhibition taking place. Plenty of shops, a few restaurants and afterwards we decided to follow the signs to the satay club which turned out to be an excellent food complex with a range of eating places, but certainly a much further walk than the signs suggested."
"The Sakura was not fully bloomed when we went on 15 Mar 18. The flowers in the dome were unique. However, should considered lowering the price for Singaporeans. Not really worth the money."
This is my second visit to Flower Dome and Cloud Forest..the flowers in Flower Dome seem to be aged a little and wilting in Spring ?! Just a few decorations to fit the Sakura theme but i don't find any Sakura at all.
"Erm...did this as I thought we should as we were in Singapore and even more so as we were staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel.I was expecting more if I'm honest, it was literally just a large greenhouse with flowers It may just be us, i don't really know what we were expecting but it just didn't do anything for us.The cloud dome was slightly better, although once you've seen the waterfall that's it."
Frankly the giant trees did not seem extraordinary to me. The garden is beautiful as a whole. But i would not consider this as a top attraction of Singapore.
It is a normal place .. you can only enjoy the flowers view and the cold weather generated by the Air Conditioners.. you can visit it if you have a free time in your trip .. not worth spending the whole day there
"... otherwise, give the flower dome a miss. Cloud dome a bit more interesting. Free gardens worth a wander. Skyway closed as rain was forecast, looked very limited to us."
"Firstly there is an entrance fees to the 2 domes i.e. cloud forest and flower dome. Flower dome is a bit over rated. Cloud forest was nice with indoor waterfall. Although the best part is super tree grove which is actually free. Go in the evening,7pm I think( not sure about the time). Great light and sound show. Wanted to go on the skywalk which has a $8 fees but had 50 min waiting, so dropped the plan."
"It is nice, but not as special as some of the comments might imply.As we stayed at the Marina Bay Sands we strolled around the Gardens which are right next to the hotel, and there are nice areas, of course, but overall it seemed quite artificial and did not appeal to us as Singapore Botanic Garden.If you have plenty of time, go there, it is unique after all and you might like the modern interpretation of the garden.For us, it was mostly boring and we actually fell asleep while watching the light show (it seemed to be Christmas themed) from our balcony. :D"
"We visited the Gardens in the evening. Many, many people around us. We had to wait in a row to use the stairs. Very hot because there is no wind and because of the large crowd. Visit during daytime is best, and go for pictures to the observation desk of of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel in the evening."
"We came back today to do the flower dome as we had done the mountain dome last time.Just as well as the mountain dome was closed for maintenance - with no warning given. I'd have been very annoyed if I'd trekked all the way from the MRT in 34 degrees to find it shut.Half the toilets were closed. The flower dome was in the middle of a 'display change' some many of the flowers were dead or dying. The restaurant in the dome was closed for a private party. Again, no warning and on the way out, the gift shop was closed for a stock take and the ladies loos were out of paper.We were still charged full price, though. Not good enough, really. I understand that maintenance has to be done but they could warn you at the station and you can make a choice before you make the walk in the heat."
A must see despite being a major tourist trap. Definitely get entry to flower and cloud domes if only to escape the heat ( but bring a sweater).Flowers are varied but some looked a bit darn wonder how they survive in extreme conditions (temperature very controlled and too cool) with no insect bee or natural life.The cloud forest had a sad excuse for waterfall but the main spectacle was watching others take corny selfies.Finally the video on global warming and tips on how to save the world was priceless.... the irony was not lost on us being in a huge air conditioned dome ! Imagine the carbon footprint we just left behind .
Man made garden and is a waste of money. It may be appealing for people from cities but sure not for those who are surronded by nature.
"We went up the trees, but it was too busy to go in the glasshouses. Since it has only recently been created it was a bit raw - I should think it will improve with time."
"Made an evening visit to see the light show. I can see the attraction, but personally I was underwhelmed."
It's big and pretty but nothing to write home about. But probably good for families who are on vacation. It's also too hot to walk around for a long time for.
"Start off with the positives. The light show at night in the Supertree Grove was wonderful. These modern structures are beautiful forms, supporting a myriad of plants. The two large conservatories on site are just as stunning in their own way. I love plants and nature. The tropics are home to do many weird and wonderful plants. I bought a ticket for the Cloud Forest conservatory. Instead of seeing nature at its best, you are confronted the height of tackiness. Caught the elevator to the ""Lost World"". A display of carnivorous plants set amongst lego plants. My heart sunk. It did not get any better. People were taking selfies with all the plastic plants and fake styrofoam / plaster animals and insects, set in amongst the plants. I know they are also attempting to educate people about the environment, however do we really need to sell nature like it is a Disneyland?"
"From the outside the architecture looks great, but the interior landscape and flower arrangements do not look good. Also, the entrance fees are too high."
The cloud dome and flower dome are quite different from any garden you will see so it is good to be here.
"To be fair it was a saturday and Chinese New year when we visited but the place was super busy and crowded, meaning queues for everything which made the experience not very pleasant especially in the heat. the two greenhouses are impressive but the collection of plants inside is pretty standard fair."
After visiting the 'botanical gardens ' in the morning and being very impressed with them this had a theme park feel to it and the flowers did not seem as good . The light show of the trees on the evening however was very impressive
"We visited in the evening. Flower Dome was very crowded and children were running around everywhere, crying, screaming and playing. We enjoyed Cloud Forest more, especially the walk down the ""mountain"". Overall, these places are kind of cool, but overrated. There should be a max number of people so that it doesn't feel like a kindergarden."
"It was a great place to visit at night, lots of other tourists though, the tree light shows were spectacular."
I planned to visit Garden by the Bay in the night time due to temperature and crowd but it's not different. Too much people and I could see or notice anything much.
Nothing much to see as they advertise flower in import fm China also air con no so cold a bit disappointed
"This is the second time I visit this place. The flowers are not 'energetic' as last time when I 1st visit 2 years ago. Lots of visitors are not aware that they are not supposed to touch the flowers, especially Chinese visitors. It is heart breaking to see these flowers being 'tortured to death' :("
"The garden was lovely and the atmosphere was just great,you can take lots of pictures and the view from the top is remarkable."
"We had a light lunch at the Gardens By the Bay. The restaurant was set up to process a large number of guests very rapidly, and ordering involved completing a large checklist of dishes. Service was efficient but not friendly. The food was moderately good."
"Nice place to spend the evening with family. Biking, strolling casually, playing water in their lovely waterpark. Always love to go back.."
When I heard about the gardens I've been so excited to get there but maybe I didn't see what everybody was raving about because I thought it was good but not spectacular.I love plants and have a green thumb so was looking forward to exotic type of plants and an abundance of color. I'm glad I went but won't need to go again any time soon.
The lights at night were nice. The indoor rain forest was very crowded. The outdoor gardens was nice.
"I recommend visiting this place both in the morning when it is not too hot, and in the evening to watch the elegant lightings and the gardens rhapsody. The gardens rhapsody is a music and light entertain that is really worth watching. Whilst the scenery and flower dome is nice to be admired, I find this place lacking in terms of halal food options. There are only 2 halal food options here - MacDonalds and Texas Chicken - both being fast food type. For Muslim travellers, if you don't like fast food, you will have to go elsewhere for a meal. Nearby - there are Marina Bay Sands (not much options for halal food) and Sate by The Bay (a food court; the halal stalls seems to open only after 4pm when I last visited)."
Definitely worth a visit - although we went in daytime and I think it would be better at night when all lit up.Very spectacular set-up the way it is all set up and a relaxing place to walk around.A benefit of going during the.day is you will have great views over Singapore from the trees...but of course you can also get even better from top of the Marina Bay (boat).Unfortunately it started to rain a bit when we went up our first tree and the staff had to order everyone off the bridges and down to ground level - so our excursion was cut short.
"This time accompanied a friend who was the first timer. He said good things about the garden, I was getting bored about what I saw (several times).It was a late noon after a short raining and I got tired after a long walk that day.It should be relaxing afternoon in Gardens by the Bay, but too bad I did not feel excited anymore."
It was a bit crowded and your quickly get planted out.Cool inside but a hot walk to get there.Not cheap
"Very beautiful!Easy to get to from our hotel. MRT stops right at gardens by the bay entrance.Tickets right off the entrance of MRTYou can see the cloud forest, super tree grove, and botanical flower garden there approxSupergrove tree are free entry!Light show at 7:45 8:45"
"It is a beautiful garden for families who enjoy seeing flowers and greens. Admissions are required for the two indoor gardens, skywalks and shuttle cars. Other outdoor areas are basically free. As for outdoors, watch the weather; it could get quite hot during the afternoon or no place to hide from rain."
If some one like plant I recommend this place. But if you what pay money I suggest another thing to visit.
"In terms of architecture and concept, it is a great idea to build a giant articial forest amidst Singaporean massive buildings. However, it is too expensive. Better to visit Borneo for the true sights of tropical rainforest."
"A very pretty park, but the whole place looks too well done. Not a leaf is out of place, which makes it appear very man made. Between this and the Southern Ridges, I much prefer the latter, which is a 10 km walk through a number of parks (see my review on this walk).We used ofo share bikes (free till 4 Feb 2018) and rode along the water and covered some distance quite easily. Much easier than waking in the heat and humidity. Highly recommended."
"Nice place but every body was there as it was end of December holiday. If you are in Singapore, it is a must to visit"
This place is a display of plants and certainly interesting. The admission price is not cheap but it's on the 'must see' list for Singapore.
"Unfortunately modern parents seem to feel no need to ensure that their young do the right thing by all.This is very evident here, where children are allowed to run amok to the detriment of those mature people who have actually paid to be there.Someone has described these attractions as ""the most beautiful place on earth"";the sights are quite impressive, but hardly deserving of such a gushing appellation as ""the most beautiful place..""My frequent thought was where on earth did they get the stalagmites and stalactites from. This is never answered as you go throughSeriously, the uncontrolled children - and the place is full of them - ruin this for the not-so-sure of their steps, the elderly, and for all decent people.There is never a sign of a worker to keep these children or their parents in line.I have just noticed that Tripa apparently wants reviews from ""couples, Family (young children), family (teens), business or solo"", but not from me, a 70-ish bloke who went there with his daughter.There is no category for one such as I, but I expect I'm not Robinsion Crusoe.; lifto the gamo Tripa, there's a good chap."
A different variety of plants and beautifully planted. Great maintenance .I think it was so - so maybe because there is nothing special for the season I went.
Great experience. The best at night. We took a lovely long walk. A bit pricey but a must do if you are in Singapore
There is two domes which are buit on reclaimed land. I was told that the electricity for this entire area also generated through regenerative sources. The cloud dome simulates environment from sea level to mountain level and demonstrates varous plants and tress across various levels of temp and humidity. It is very educational.the flower dome is seasonal and shows variety of plants and tress from various continents. there is separate price fo locals and tourists. be mindful of closure dates for maintenance. the area is good for a half-a-day tour.
We enjoyed & celebrated Christmas. Very nice only thing is restaurant is very small and not very cozy.
Very interesting. This site has a free part which is also very interesting. You pay for each other part separately. So you can spend a lot of money or nothing. Recommend this for children as well since there's plenty of areas to run and play. I only visited the rain forest which was nice
Didn't have loads of time so walked though the Flower Dome. Pleasant time. Everything well labeled. If you are in to plants this is the place to be.
We headed to Gardens by the Bay when they has their Christmas Wonderland event in which meant that we had to pay to go in.It is lovely and well worth going.Be mindful that the sky walk will close if it is raining.
nice to bring kids out for sightseeing at the night. the only downfall is that there isnt much seating area.
The outside gardens are really nice but the domes are nothing special. A bit boring actually. The lightshow in the evening is nice.
I came on the first week of Jan and i was sort of disappointed that there wasnt much flowers blooming at that time :/ but it was a beautiful conservatory nonetheless.
"Gardens by the bay is a cool experience but not sure I would recommend everyone to go. The indoor waterfall was really cool as was the dome in which it's contained, but the flower dome wasn't as impressive. Sure the flowers are cool but I don't think it's worth the price. Maybe my experience would have been different if I went at night to see the light show."
"Always love visiting this place. Always something new to see and the plants are really exotic. You can walk around for hours and enjoy yourself. Loads of fun with the family. Get lost in nature.Sore point - staff not so professional - huddling together and giggling. When it rains the transfer buggies are suspended. No one gives any information and you just hang around wondering what will happen next. Needs to be addressed.Despite that, its a wonderful place to be."
Should visit both in day and night to have a complete view of the gardens. Too much to walk can avoid if you are not much into botanical interest.
"Both domes were amazing. Cloud Forest (?) was especially jaw-dropping, i really have no other complaints besides the ridiculously long queue when i visited on 26Dec. The Christmas exhibition, i forgot the exact name, was pretty disappointing to say the least. The lights looked really cheap and not at all well-designed, the area was too packed to move about freely, the stalls and booths were too small to accommodate more than 4 people at once. Felt like the exhibition was poorly planned, all in all. Went in there, took a few pictures and left promptly. The choir was pretty good though, kudos."
"The Gardens are lovely it's amazing to see so many different plants in one area.When we got there we got on the audio tour bus $8 adults (not sure on kids prices) this was its about a 17 min drive around the whole garden which was good for us to see a little bit of everything so we could decided on what we wanted to see.We decided to walk on the bridge which is up in the trees. This cost us another $8 per adults you can either claim the stairs ( I think there was 103 stairs) or take the lift up the view were wonderful. The big tree has a restaurant in it which opens for lunch and dinner. ( you should book this) the menu looked good lots of different foods to choose from, we didn't eat there. We went up to the roof top to have a look around and then to the bar area to have a cold drink. For us to go up it cost us $12 per person for a glass of soft drink or juice I think if you wanted wine etc it cost $24.I really wanted to look inside the 2 Conservatory ( flower dome and the cloud forest ) but seeing the standard rate was $28.00 per adult to go into both I decided to leave I had already spent $28 on me and there was 3 of us. The beauty of the place got lost with the amount of money they kept asking for.I must say I had no idea on the cost because it was a last minute thing to go see the Gardens by the bay."
"Almost as much infrastructure, and engineering, as opposed to horticulture. There are some very impressive "" special effects"", with free flowing waterfalls, and walkways 25 foot in the air, around the treetops. But for all this, the displays seem secondary to the construction., and whilst the ""Flower Dome"" is rather good, it could be better with more imaginative and extravagant floral displays.In truth, it is more of a circus , than a celebration of natural vegetation .Not really worth the considerable outlay."
"The two domes look quite impressive from the outside so we decided to visit the two different garden-concepts on a rainy day during our stay in Singapore (together with plenty of other people).I was honestly not that impressed. Particularly the waterfall-dome - where we had to queue for 30 minutes to get up with the elevator - fell short of my expectations. The round-walks are rather short and not that exciting. The Flower-Dome was quite nice with a lot less people and more space to look around.If you only have a few days in Singapore, my tip is to go to the botanical garden instead of the Domes."
"The Christmas lights were wonderful. However, to appreciate the gardens and its surroundings, visitors should visit the gardens during the day. The Cloud Forest and Flower Dome garden night lights were too dim and hence we are unable to see clearly the exhibits and hence we were unable to appreciate the gardens and its surroundings. Unless, you are at the gardens to see the Christmas lights and the decorations I advise visitors to visit it during the daytime. On the day of the visit the crowd was too large at the Christmas Wonderland. By the time we got to the OCBC Skyway the gate was closed. The organiser should have extended the opening hours of the OCBC Skyway so that everyone get the opportunity to experience the scenic stroll on the skyway. By the way the closing time was 9.00pm (a bit too early for such an occasion where they are many visitors to the gardens)."
"You can't help be impressed by this attraction. Night (dark) best time to view if you have to make the choice of timing with the light show we did not see.Entry to gardens free but the items you really want to see makes up for it. Cloud Forest worth entry ($12 SGD) although exhibits of stalagmites and tytes artificial and were better left out to make the gardens authentic, Flower garden wasn't."
"It is definitely a beautiful attraction. My family of 6 including my 3yo was there on 24 Dec for Christmas Wonderland. I had to leave with my 3yo half an hour after we got there because of long queues everywhere especially for food. Service at Pollen was appalling, the staff didn't look interested in manning the entrance to guide customers into the cafe despite empty tables. The queue for Mc Donald's was out the door and stretched for quite abit. Maybe during peak season you could limit the number of people entering into sessions and have pop up food stalls/trucks to help with food queues. I will definitely visit again when I return to Singapore for a holiday just not during your busy period."
It was fun. The kids really enjoyed how it was lit up at night. They offer a bridge walk which is cool for pictures and experience.
"The decorations are very unique and attractive. Yet, we took about one hour to line up and enter the rain forest conservatory during the Christmas holiday."
"The light show at Marina Bay Gardens start at 8.45pm and is worth a look, the kids will like it and from what I saw a lot of adults did too.Most people go into the middle of the trees and look up when it starts, I found if you look around the garden and then just before the light show head back towards the stairs were there is a round grassed area with some chairs, you get a much better view from there."
Take a stroll in the area. Good way to relax and unwind. Check out the indoor waterfall! All of it have cool and unique features :)
"The entry tickets are costly. The tall water-fall is quite impressive. There is no major things to see inside, except for those who love to take pictures of creepy plants and some colorful flowers.It has good-to-see overall environment."
Prices are in line with all other attractions in Singapore. Look out for discounts at your hotel. You may can save a few dollars. The cloud forest is worth to go. However the flower dome is not. It was disappointing.
Travel to Singapore few times and finally decided to visit this place. Had high expectation as it is highly recommended through the review. Cloud forest- nothing much and don't see much plants or specialty at this place except to que long line to go up 7 level to the top of the indoor water fall and walked down through the bridge and the midst release every 2 hours. Flower dome - don't see a lot of flora n fauna even there are a lot of different gardens. Almost everyone keep taking photos of the decorations instead of getting know the plants which may not be common - as there wasn't any special plants to get to know. I visited botanical gardens in north Thailand and this is far much disappointed.
Positives were the two domes and the shuttle bus service to get our around the park in the rain/if you are not able to walk. The tree towers looked amazing but rain meant visiting them wasn't possible.The sky bridge being closed due to rain was understandable but lack of signage or info about it was disappointing
"The night view was very nice, but due to too many tourists at the Cloud Forest queuing for the lifts, is a bit of wasted visiting time."
"Great development and wonderful location. Really nice light show. However, way too many people and had to que for an hour to enter cloud Forrest. Also the Christmas show. Far too many people and not much for the $20 charged."
"Two huge gardens, both under domes. The scale of this undertaking is truly impressive. Their contents were OK, with the Cloud Forest being a bit more interesting. Not cheap to visit, but upkeep on this must be expensive. A reasonable adventure for a couple of hours, but definitely not the highlight of a visit to Singapore."
Flower dome was average. Wonderland food fare was mostly junk food. Could have done better w healthier choices. Toilets- pls put up portable gd ones so that ppl need not walk so far and Q damn long
I was honestly disappointed with my visit. It was nice but not as amazing as I had expected it to be so my review is based on the high expectations I had fÃ¶r this place. The Cloud Forest and Skyway are both worth a visit and in my opinion the highlights. I was there during the day so perhaps an evening visit with all the lights would have improved the experience.
"Expensive, cramped, poor signage, dispointing, is very hard to get in and out, very poor signs see you looping around and around"
"Cash Weste 10+8 Dollar,Not Good when u see..Every body saying Singapore main attraction , but I felt, IAm not happy.."
"We visited the place as it was one of the major attraction in Singapore, however the place is nice and pleasant. My personal belief is that the garden and plant lover will love this place more. Otherwise it is average place"
"Pros-* Usually the weather is either too sunny or rainy in Singapore. Since the place is covered it becomes more attractive.* Having visited the concrete jungle around, the flowers and greenery is a welcome* Will make your visit refreshing no matter when you go.Cons -* Gets boring if you are not fascinated by flowers* Requires you to walk so if you have elderly people. It would take longer than usual and eventually turn difficultIf you are in Singapore around Christmas, there is a wonderful Christmas Wonderland carnival taking place. For S$10 it is a must visit."
Not for bonafide nature lovers. Plants from different climates and regions stored in concrete settings do not a garden make.
"The food is too overpriced, eg. The fries was $8 and all the games were about $4-$8 per try! The flower dome was really good please bring Poinsettia Wishes back! :))"
"This was my 3rd visit for Christmas wonderland. I felt this year was down-played - in terms of variety of stalls, and activities. Tokens for games, stall food and drinks were overpriced as usual. Couldn't match up to last years' set up as a third time customer. And it was my first time experience for my parents."
"There are two domes in the Gardens by the Bay area. Although the place have been designed and maintained very nicely, however, there is nothing really special here. There's an artificial water-fall which many seemed to enjoy. If you have never seen a real water fall in life, then you could get excited. The attractions in different floors were nothing spectacular. Overall, a dull experience for me."
The flower dome had so little variety.... it was quite disappointing. And the northern lights display was a bit lame too
"Cloud forest is excellent, flowers of dome is average flower exhibition sort.. trees with lights dont look that great unlike in pictures.."
"Gardens by the bay is a spectacular site !! Its a must do on your Singapore trip . It is advisable to visit this place when the lights go on after dark .they have an amazing light and sound show , we were lucky to experience the Christmas theme light show !!Although it's really alright if you don't visit the paid area of this attraction , untill ofcourse if you're a botanist . If so be the case then one should visit the place in the day to see the large variety of plants and their arrangements ."
"Lights are spectacular, though would have loved more lights, so visit when it is dark. But, also, time your visit with the snow shower (Blizzard Time) which was a lot of fun especially for those that do not get to see snow that often. Blizzard Time is 55 minutes past every hour starting at 7:55 and the final show being at 10:00. The Marks are brought down because the choice of shops in the Xmas market were not very exciting. I am a shopper but was not enticed to shop at all."
I suppose if you live in a desert or a rain forrest the domes are interesting. As a Scottish person don't believe I paid to go into something UK temperature and see plants I have seen outside in Europe.
Witnessed beautiful laser and night light shows. Parking can be a challenge so best to go by public transport
Gardens by the Bay were a disappointment to me. I visited the botanical gardens the day before and I'm sad I didn't come here first. After the beauty in the botanical gardens this felt nothing.
"Visited late in the day - took a taxi to the Marina Bay Sands with plans to go up to bar/restaurant - queue was quite long so we went straight to the Gardens via a walkway. Glad we did this vs. take a taxi to Gardens directly. the walkway had a great view of the gardens. There was a holiday event going on in the super tree grove which you had to pay to enter, then an additional charge to get onto the OCBC walkway - we chose to not pay the fee and just watch the light show. Kept waiting for something interesting to happen during the light show - but nothing did! We ended up paying to go through the Cloud Forest - which made the trip to the Gardens worthwhile. Very well done - recommend it be seen at night - think daytime would have ruined it."
Paid attractions were expensive and on my opinion did not offer value for money. I was here in December and the free gardens were perhaps not on their best.
As the title suggests. Friends told me that there was a lot more decorations the past 2 years and so what we saw were only like 25% of the usual/past decor.
I didn't get into the forrest and really wanted to see the cloud forrest.The park would probably be a nice walk with someone. I was on my own so I wasn't really that impressed.
"If you're a plant person, go for it. Otherwise, it's not really worth it. The tall flower things were not blooming, and the greenhouse was packed."
"I know it's harsh, but I felt like the gardens light show was quite underwhelming. We went for the Christmas one, featuring fake foam snow... It was pretty, but not that impressive. Awkward."
Neat to see but packed with people. Going at night so you can see the lights is a good idea. They're open til 9
"This beautiful collection of domes and gardens has the advantage of offering welcome coolness in the suffocating heat of the city as most of the spaces are air conditioned, surprisingly. You can take the shuttle to further reduce walking.The planting of the flowers and trees is amazing. Great gift shop and good food outlets. Very easy to reach and soon to be easier as the MR is being extended.A great day out. My one criticism is that few of the specimens are labelled which is frustrating."
Very green to make you relax and rejuvenate. But some sections had bad odor coming from rotten fruit or leaves
Not really my sort of place. It was too touristy and we have seen similar indoor domes back at home in uk.Sun garden with cacti was very good.Didn't do sky walk as it was thundering!
There were not many flowers this time and nothing spectacular for Christmas. I've been to Flower Dome several times and always enjoyed it but this time is very disappointing and especially the Northern lights was a huge disappointment as we waited till 7pm thinking there'll be some light performances and was looking out for it but it was a mere light reflection on the panel.
"Gardens by the Bay are a fun attraction, but super gimmicky and touristy. The indoor flower garden was a waste for me, especially considering the city has its own i) botanical gardens (which are great) and ii) the general priority on having green spaces everywhere. The waterfall (forest?) one is worth visiting if you want to do one of the two, but would only give a soft recommendation on the whole complex."
"Gardens by the Bay is one of Singapore's highlights. It gives you the opportunity to visit two different experiences inside of two domes. You can choose to go to both or just one.If you have a lack of time (or money) I would recommend to only visit the Cloud Forest. The Flower Dome is nice and has some cool trees, but if you're from Europe this dome will not be that special since many trees and plants are from Europe.However, I liked the Cloud Forest very much! The eye-catching artificial waterfall (with artificial clouds as well) is very impressive to see and gives a good opportunity to make photo's. Next to that, this garden is filled with the tropical flowers and plants, which I expected to see in the flower dome. There is not that much to see and you can be finished pretty fast, but it definitely is a nice experience.Tip: bring a jacket or cardigan. Compared to the artificial tropical gardens back in Europe, it is very cold at Gardens by the Bay."
As long as you are not a environmentalist this place is a decent 1 time visit with decent Music show in evening.
This is a lovely place to visit and well worth the walking. It is beautiful to see at night also when the trees are all light up.
"From the minute you step out of the MRT station, each and every where you go will be charged. From the coach ride, to the overhead bridge for better view, you need to pay for all. But if you have strong legs and high tolerance for humid and hot temperature, then the garden is a paradise . I brought my baby and arrived at 3 pm , stayed for not more than 10 minutes as couldnt bear the temperature . Its a good idea to visit in the evenings."
"I visited here in May of 2015 and found the Wold of Flowers blooming with abundance and color. I took more pictures of flowers that day than I have in my life and some of them turned out to be real winners. It was fascinating to learn all about them and see them in all their glory. With that in mind, visiting Singapore again in November 2017, with my 33 yr old nephew, I was excited to show him as well. Upon entering it, I could see they had it decorated for Christmas and exceedingly so. So much that I did not really see any flowers stand out. Apparently this time of year, only about an 1/8 of the flowers I saw in May of 2015 were on display in Nov of 2017. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. As well as all of the tourists posing for selfies and not letting you see the flowers, it was not a successful visitation. I would not recommend this at all for anyone at this time of year. Even the holiday decorations were a little over the top so not exactly warm and fuzzy. I wish I could have given it a good review as I loved it the last time, but I had to apologize to my nephew for building up his excitement for this attraction only to be very disappointed."
"We went to the Garden by the bay on 12th November. But the christmas decoration wasn't ready, advertised the christmas theme will be started on 10 November."
"It is very nice atmosphere, there are many trees to watch and take pictures. Both of indoor garden are really nice and beautiful. It was amazing for me."
"This is a new trendy place to visit while in Singapore . I came here in the evening .I could see the beautiful lighting of the Garden . Although it disappeared very fast and came back quite long time. Would be better if the appearance of the light is longer , because we wanted to take photo and it was very difficult .Overall, it is a nice place for an evening walk"
Recommend you to have a jacket or wear long sleeve to enjoy your visits in the gardens. It was raining outside and inside with full power air conditioning... It was like a freezer.
"nowhere near as interesting as it's supposed to be. Felt very Disney-esque. Lots to see for a kid, probably, but for an adult without kids.. just a giant mall with some trees. Everything felt very fake, also. Bit disappointing."
"On the outside (no ticket required), many structures can be seen, especially good scenery at night. During day time, purchase tickets to visit the flower domes and exhibits within the ticket areas."
We were disappointed. Light show only lasted 10min. We also purchased tickets prior to the show for the tree top bridge. We had planned to do it after the show. Staff would not let us on afterwards. Unsure why as others were allowed.
"Nice effort with a good spread of different plants. Waterfall is too unreal. Visit once will suffice. For those who are pro environment protection or have concerns over climate change, this place is not too pleasing in consideration the amount of energy running (aircon) to sustain the enclosure."
"Mostly are man-made structure. The most interesting amenity in this place is the cloud-forest dome, but entrance fee is very expensive. If you want to enjoy a free musical lighting show, come at night time around 6:30pm"
We didn't know what to expect we enjoy plants but not enough to say this place rocked our world .So dont waste your time if you dont love flowers and dont take your kids there is nothing for them to do and they will be bored. But if you love plants and enjoy a walk then give it a crack its just not our choice of fun.Definetly bring a jumper or something warm we found it freezing inside but the gardens outside were much easier to enjoy because of the climate
"It's free so for that reason probably should rate it higher, but that aside singing to get around not great, lack of info on plants and really high prices for the walkway and two eco domes so didn't bother with these."
This is like going to a garden version of a zoo. Fake trees to replace the real thing as they cannot grow in this environment. But they do a good job keeping some of the species alive. Not really my scene.
"I visited these beautiful attractions years back and thought that it had improved over the years but I was quite disappointed to find out that they weren't. Firstly, the online redemption staff wasn't professional with her reply to me when I showed her the email confirmation. Maybe because I am just a local she said, 'This? Just go in!!' (Pointing the way without even looking at me. Pretty rude actually and kind of ruined my excitement. Please train her and to treat every visitors the same. Wish I had taken her name. My other issue was the only cafe in the Gardens was closed for a private event and there were no proper seating arrangements (picnic tables) outside for the visitors to enjoy their snacks. It's the least you can do to provide these convenience because poor tourists and locals like myself had to resort to sitting at the steps and what not. Quite unsightlt actually in mine and their opinions which they did shared with me. These attractions are supposed to be world class so what happened here?"
"i am surprised when i enter one dome.there is mountain and you can see plants from high place.it is very cold,so you should bring long sleeve."
"I visited this place ""only and only"" because of the excitement that was screamed by several reviewers on tripadvisor. But frankly, I was impressed but not floored. The reeling effect of real nature - with its manifold facets and unpredictability - is missed with such ventures. Artificial gardens don't bring people towards nature but create more disengagement of man and the wild. Two domes - heavily air conditioned for artificial ""atmosphere"" - is no way fo telling mankind that we care for nature ! Good for awareness and propaganda but not for REAL thing! Lets say - we can't manufacture nature - and that's exactly what we are trying to do here.One more thing- this attraction involves a lot of physical labour and is not suitable for very young children and seniors. The domes are quite artificially colder and there is a huge mismatch between the outer and inner climates. A light jacket is advisable for this attraction.The price of this attraction is quite high as compared to what it offers."
"If you love flowers, plants and are a botanist at heart, please do visit this. Otherwise, well it is just a place with lot of plants, flowers, pumpkins and of course a big huge dome that is speciality of Singapore i.e. man-made structures. Other than that, there is very little for this place to offer. There is a light and sound show in the evening, which is well again similar to the title of the review - strictly okay. Perhaps, they need to create a theme for the light and sounds show. Just by putting up a few nicely sounding songs on a superb sound system and then creating light and laser effects around the few towers in the vicinity just doesn't cut much ice. A theme is sadly missing."
"Told this is related to the Eden Project. Lots of plants, trees and flowers but my most vivid memory is the ""selfie barriers"". Entire families blocking the way taking snap shots of themselves.Still its interesting and well worth a visit."
Place to spend time with family or partners.Beautiful garden where you can find foc activities for family activities. If you prefer something better. Buy tickets to flower dome or forest dome. Food cafe and restaurants can be found here also. Avoid sat and sun. Too crowded.
This is good to see while in Singapore. My kids weren't too fussed on seeing the cloud forest so I don't think I'd do that again. There were a lot of people and we had trouble catching a taxi to go back to the hotel. Had to walk to Marina Bay Sands to catch a taxi
The artificial gardens and plants make for an interesting view. Entry is bit expensive for the offered sightseeing.
We went evening time and I guess it is not so ideal for flower dome due to less lights- but understand if too much light can affect the nature setup. Next time will visit in daylight.
"What I feel here is, I have many natural perfect photo spots. The easiest way to go here is by MRT drop off at bayfront and go inside MBS (Marina Bay Sands) by elevator to direct floor where there is a bridge connect MBS with Garden by the bay. From the front gate into flower dome is quit far, just if you feel not fit enough. There is shuttle, but you need to pay it. Have a good experience here!"
"As you know, things don't go as plan in most trips and in this trip though we planned to see both gardens before 6pm and had dinner somewhere else. We ended up getting here around 7pm, had a quick dinner, be the last group to see the waterfall and stayed til the Garden closed.I tried to book discounted tickets through some website but did not manage to get the online tickets in time for exchanging them into the real tickets and ended up having to buy new ones. So please do check before you book anything in advance.Waiting for the rest of my party to come, I took my son to explore the playground by the water play area just in front of the entrance to the actual Garden and he absolutely loved it. The water play area was a bit crowded but seem like a lot of fun. So, do come prepare with swimming gears and change of clothes if you are with kids. And the plus side is that this area is free!We ate at one of the cafes scattered around the Garden. There are several of them. Food was quick and decent.The waterfall was impressive. The temperature in the dome was much cooler (and wetter) than I had expected. You get to ride the elevator to the top and decent down along the walkways. Seeing the Garden at night gave you a totally different feeling from daytime. It was more futuristic and Avartar-like.It was a shame that we had to rush though everything (even the giftshop!) as they were closing.There were long lines for taxi as we exited, but with Grab, we got our taxi within 5 mins. So, Grab is the way to go in Singapore!"
"The gardens are worth a visit but...be prepared to get very hot. There is not much shade, so walking around can be an exhausting and sweaty experience. However, the gardens are immaculately kept with some interesting flowers and trees, but the highlights are the Â´supertrees', cloud forest, and flower dome. Inside the domes the temperature is much more bearable, each taking about 45 minutes to wander around."
"Nice gardens in very large glass houses. Very interesting plants, with limited clarifications and information. There was not much of a system in the exhibition. There was some arrangement, but the main goal of the exhibition seemed a nice view and not another goal (educational for instance)."
Artificial forest..artificial garden.Worth to visit once but don't feel like will pay visit for flower dome and cloud forest next time.Would like to try ocbc skyway on my next visit.
The place is good to visit . The light show is good. The place was crowded . Try to avoid it on a weekend/holiday.
"First, thankfully, on a hot day in SG, this garden is air-conditioned, and yes it is quite cool inside that you may need to wear a jacket. Good place to hang around with female companions who love to take pictures. 1 hour is enough to loiter around, then head over to Super Tree Grove near the evening for a lights and sounds experience."
"Don't get me wrong this is a must to visit, but unless you are a real lover of flowers the rest of it I found a little disappointed as you can see this sort of thing in many countries. The dome itself is incredible however there was rather large and strange display of pumpkins when we were there? Do go though."
The visit is nice but I suppose is more interesting if you are keen on plants or botanic in general.In my opinion is too expensive.
"Not very impressive as gardens go, Indoor facility was a drop off on the hop on/off bus OK if it is raining a matter of taste good for botanists I suppose but much of a muchness to Jo Bloggs"
I personally thought that paying S$8/pp to go up to the skywalk was a bit of a waste of money. The views are mostly obstructed by the wires holding the bridge up and I wasn't impressed with the surrounding area either. I imagine it might be cooler to see after dark with all the lights but I preferred standing looking up at these weird 'trees'.
"Well we were expecting a lot as we heard many awesome reviews about it. However we head down to the flower dome last week and as it is the Halloween season, all we see were cactus and pretty normal vegetation and flowers. Not worth the money though if you ask me."
"The Garden's Grove consists of the Flower Dome and the Cloud dome. All in all I'd have to say I found the Cloud Dome more impressive than the Flower Dome. Upon entering the Cloud dome you see a big waterfall. Then you take the elevator to the top floor, and walk the way down through various exhibitions and gardens. The flower dome takes you through different gardens with various themes and from different locations. I was impressed by the Cloud Dome, after which the Flower Dome felt a bit anti-climactic. Perhaps it would be wise to visit the Flower Dome first, as tickets can not be bought separately, unless you are a resident of Singapore."
"I don't know why but I expected more after reading the write-ups. It's quite expensive to get in, and then you get stung amother $3 for a courtesy shuttle to the the two main buildings. Signage in the buildings is not particularly good and you often land up where you were 15 minutes previously. On the whole, a nice experience, but expensive."
Cloud forest is amazing. However the other conservatory was not that great. Will recommend to only go to cloud forest. Must take jackets for small children as it is extremely cold sometimes. Laser light show is just average. Don't put extra effort to watch it.
"The Gardens by the Bay area one of the things that a tourist will always see in ads about Singapore. The gardens are beautifully designed as goes for the lighting which creates a cozy atmosphere. However, when you visit this place in the evening, it may be very crowded, which combined with the heat, doesn't make a really comfortable place to be. I would say it's worth it, but be aware of high chances on a crowded place. Would not really recommend during day time."
"Probably more enjoyable with children but there's a lot of plastic figures . The decorative discs and plastic bottles are in the silver and gold gardens. The foliage is not silver or gold, just the imitation trees. The sky walk was closed for hours because of the ""possibility of rain "". This is Singapore and it rains all the time but this time it didn't rain at all. We gave up waiting. It would have costs us 56 SKD to go in as a couple to the two domes.....which are really conservatoriesIf you want real plants and beauty go to botanical gardens which are free and natural and so much betterN"
We love going there and have been there a number of times since they opened but the crowds keep getting bigger. The lantern exhibits looked great and we would have enjoyed it better if it weren't so crowded. The boardwalks also become dangerous to walk on when the crowd starts using them at the same time to move elsewhere. My wife almost got pushed out into the wet ground.
"The concept and engineering are spectacular, but I prefer to view plants and flowers without queuing or walking past them in a procession. Much better to see them in a peaceful environment, with the company of birds and other wildlife rather than crowds of people.Okay, we shouldn't have started our visit in the middle of a Saturday afternoon, but this was the time of day recommended by our Singapore agent and he didn't warn us about the impact of the large crowds, including the 40 minute wait to get a taxi back to our hotel. So I'm warning you now.If you prefer to view flora in a peaceful environment, I recommend you visit the Singapore Botanic Garden instead."
Its pic worthyIts big i advice u bring along a pair of comfortable shoesI love how they arrange the formations n types n colors n kinds of the plantsSuch art
Gardens By the Bay is a great place to visit if you like plants/gardens. 2 huge domes house 1. the cool rainforest with a big waterfall and 2. a flower garden which actually has cacti and big trees too. The latter has changing displays based usually on the season too. It is great to visit but too hot to see the outside gardens but these are less of an attraction. There is a light show at night amongst the super trees and a suspended walk between them you can (pay) to do during the day. Nice to visit.
The place is easily accessible by MRT or a Taxi.Just follow the directions after alighting at the MRT station and you will reach the Gardens easily. It is about 1KM walk . As you walk you will see Marina Bay Sands. linking the Gardens by a bridge. It is a very lovely walk but get your hats and umbrellas ready as it may be very hot in the afternoon.Once you get to the Domes it is ok as it is fully air conditioned.There are a few eateries there too.
"This is okay, but it's a little underwhelming when you expect to see much larger trees...It's not that interesting once you see the trees and there isn't too much to do after."
Go in the evenings otherwise it would be difficult to bear the heat. The Sound and Light show was a little Disappointing though. The two domes were good but make sure you go here only if you appreciate the beauty of Flowers and nature. You will have to walk a lot.
We had a good time walking around and the indoor waterfall was great but not something we would visit again. The flowers are lovely if that's your kind of thing. Found it difficult to find places to change diapers or nurse baby despite signs saying baby room.
"with 2 small kids in tow aged 4 and 7 we set off in the afternoon to this place after having visited singapore flyer and science museum.There is quite a bit of walking, they should have strollers for kids. only ones they had were for toddlers. it gets hot and moist in day time, and not all kids can do the walking it needs here.Even their ticket booth is so far off, when coming from metro station, they should have some complementary shuttle to reach ticket office.discounts offered are only on bundled offers, could not understand why same discounts (SQ boarding passes) not given on individual ones.We ended up visiting the cloud forest only, which was nice and cooled by AC, but typical of a green mountain that can be seen in several countries naturally.also there was a childrens play area close to ticketing office with water fountains, which was ok if you are carrying swim costume for kids - helps them cool down.since the kids got so tired, we had to leave early evening without seeing the light show etc."
"I've been to GbtB for the 2nd time and i enjoyed both of them. They always have events to give unique experience for the visitors, like in this month the theme is Autumn, so expect to explore plants, flowers blooming in the responding theme."
"Unique garden which boasts varieties of plants and flowers from all pver the world. Educative for kids. A great effort has gone in maintainence as most of them are not native to Singapore.Cloud forest is a must visit. U will be welcomed by artificial waterfall, simulated breeze and greenery with colours popping in between. Small museums inside are not that great.Flower dome is an average place with beautiful arranfement of lovely flowers. Nothing different than usual flower shows.Tree top walk gives you great view of garden bay and u can get good pictures here. Its best in evening where towers changes colours. You might have to stand in long queues in evening. I would suggest to go by 7 pm else u wont be allowed if queues are long which is usually the case.Dont forget to take a snap of garden bay from Marina bay Sandpark in theevening. The view is breath taking.Very difficult to cover entire place in a single day. Its tiring.This place is very disappointing if you are a true nature lover as everything here is man-made landscapes. Well, nothing can beat nature rit?"
as a traveller from the UK I wasn't blown away by the two climate controlled bubbles. They are very similar to the Eden project but not quite as good...The giant tree structures are however well worth the visit and are free! Go and see the evening light show.
"Previous exhibits shows exquisite array of flowers with great arrangements. Current pumpkin displays draws just a ""meh"" conclusion at the end. The cloud forest has nil change since opening.... pls update or risk losing its appeal"
"My 2nd times to visit Garden by the Bay, find that it was too crowded this time and everything seem no difference. I think will not go again if nothing new."
Cloud Forest was much better than the Flower dome. The laser show at the super tree is highly overrated. There are no benches to sit. The whole place is totally NOT handicap friendly. People who have difficulty walking or toting on the ground or on hard surfaces should be cautious
"We visited during a three-day stopover in Singapore. Very nice gardens (outdoors is free) two indoor pavilions - Cloud Forest and Flower. Unfortunately the Flower Dome was closed when we visited. This makes the Cloud Forest quite expensive as it is priced to encourage you to visit both - from memory $14 Sing for one and $18 for two. I feel that given it was not our choice, there should have been a further price concession."
"The gardens are nice,but the lights trees show is not worthed the 2 hours waiting to be eaten alive by mosquitoes"
"I was really looking forward to seeing the Suprtrees, and thought I might as well visit the domes.From a distance the Suprtrees look awesome - but up close they weren't that impressive. Even the light show was only ok.However the actual gardens and lakes are impressive and the two domes were fantastic. So much to see and enjoy.Go and eat at the Hawker Centre - good value and good food.Suprtrees from a distance 5 stars.Suprtrees up close 1 star.Domes and Gardens 5 stars."
"This park is a work of art in its conceptualization and layout. Unfortunately though, the attractions within the park are overpriced and not worth the charge compared to other alternatives.The cloud/flower domes weren't worth the price IMHO. The cloud dome was more interesting of the two, if that helps. I actually preferred the jungle more Southeast/East of them, where the apiary and exotic birds are.BTW, the outdoor skywalk is not worth it (also IMHO).The gift store was full of heavily overpriced merchandise and pushy salespeople. There were very nice things, but 70%+ of the stuff in there I felt I needed to haggle over.Put on your walking shoes, because the foot travel here almost reaches Disneyland territory. I also recommend an umbrella, because most of the time it's either rainy or super sunny.I went to the Botanic Gardens during my trip, and found that to be more interesting than the domes or skywalk. I actually recommend both GBTB and BG, because they are so distinct."
Great view for its price but the staff can improve on being accommodating. They seem to be so tired even if we went in the morning with not much people yet.
"We took the Underground to get there.A lot to walk around, if you want to go in the domes/air conditioning, you pay to go in, worth going in, not cheap. Also pay extra to tree bridge walk, worth doing for the views."
"The garden is nice yes. But Singapore doesn't have much and this really isn't going to wow you.Many cities have gardens have I would say this is not the best I have been. There Lots of ant statues which are cool after one. But there's like 200. There's an awful baby scalper which is so ugly and then the big attractions. The ""super trees"" which look better from far than they do up close.The entrance fee to the walk and cloud dome thing is veryyy expensive. And not really worth it.If you are in Singapore then go go go but I would advise just changing at Singapore airport and staying just a maximum of 1-2 days. Cos after you had a beautiful meal and seen the gardens there's not much else to do."
We recently visited Singapore and the Garden by the Bay. There are probably 3 key things to do or see:-- the tree walkway. Nice but probably a bit expensive for a short walk. The views from there are not particularly spectacular- the floor garden. Really just an enclosed botanical garden- the cloud garden. Absolutely fantastic - and a must do. Save this till last so you end on a highWould we do it again. Probably not but worthwhile visiting at least once
"I had friends visiting from the US, but had broken my ankle so we decided to do this with me in a wheelchair. We visited the Flower Dome, Cloud Dome and had dinner at Satay by the Bay.For someone in a wheelchair, the air conditioned domes are a wonderful respite from the Singapore heat. The Flower Dome has great access - the slopes are gentle and you can pretty much see everything from the wheelchair. There was a portion accessible only by a flight of stairs, and there was a nifty looking machine to bring you up if I wanted. Needless to say, the kids really wanted me to try it.What surprised me was the Cloud Dome. I only found 1 lift to negotiate the different levels. The suspended walkways are broad enough for the wheelchair, but there were many levels that required traveling on the escalators. Given that the 1 lift was used by parents with prams, and wheelchairs like mine, it took so long for me to get anywhere, I eventually gave up and decided to wait for my friends at the ground level. To my horror, the final lift down to the ground floor brought me OUT of the Dome, and I had to backtrack to meet my friends before coming back out again. Let's just say it was not ideal, especially compared to how wheelchair friendly the rest of the Gardens was. If you have someone in your party in a wheelchair, you might want to think twice about going to the Cloud Dome."
"Pretty gardens, however very crowded. You could barely move for people taking 10 selfies per flower. The flower dome and cloud forest were beautiful but I found them over priced and a bit of an anticlimax. An okay outting, but I wouldn't say it is a must see whilst in Singapore. Go to Fort Canning to see real gardens and history without the crowds for free."
"The garden offers three sights to see while here. Cloud Tower, Flower Tower and a light show in the evening at 8pm.Of the three, the cloud tower is the most impressive place to see. It has a large waterfall and beautiful plants to see. Access to the top is provided by elevator or escalator so it is an easy access for all ages.The light show is the next best feature. It starts at 8pm and there is seating around the trees where the show takes place. A hint - get there 30 minutes ahead of time if you want to sit, otherwise you will stand or sit on the ground.The Flower Tower was disappointing. The flowers were dying and unattractive looking for the most part. There was nothing that really ""wowed"" us as we looked around the Tower.However, overall it is a nice way to spend some time."
OK so they are interesting. But really they are a tourist trap too.Flower Dome was what you might expect with throngs of people and all the usual suspects as far as plants go. The Cloud Dome was closed the day we visited. Walking around is easy and mildly interesting.
"The flower dome is very nice and well maintained. The display is kind of fix and divided by different types of plant origin like Cactus, Africa, Australia, etc.There are special exhibition held occasionally like orchids, cherry blossom which added between the or center of the flower dome.My suggestion you can visit if there is a special exhibition as you can catch both the fixed display and the special else it is just like a typical huge greenhouse."
The Outdoor garden itself is free but it's boring. What's interesting is the flower domes but those require you to pay an admission fee. I wouldn't consider giving this a try unless you want to visit the domes. They have different exhibits throughout the year so you might want to plan your schedule based on the type of event going on. Overall a decent locale for flower lovers.
"We had to come here and visit because we were curious about those towering Supertrees that we saw in the brochure. Expect to spend a day wandering around (7-hours for us); you don't want to rush through this place.We exited Bayfront MRT. Very convenient with a short walk to the Gardens. As you walk, you will see the towering Marina Bay Sands across the road as well as the Singapore Flyer and the Supertrees. The Garden is ""free"" with the exception of the two Domes and the OCBC Skyway.Visit the Information Center to grab a brochure (map) so you won't miss anything"
We thought the high frame constructions with the walk way would have been covered with vines but not!TOO MANY PEOPLE!!! It was jammed !!
"On a recent trip we stopped in SP for the weekend and decided to walk down to the gardens. Whilst the design and style is amazing, charging SGD20.00+ to enter the various displays and skywalk is steep. I'm not cheap but SGD20.00 is a tad pricy for what you get."
"So, it all depends where you come from and what excites you. There are two domes. One which is 'tropically' themed i.e. Vegatation, plants and flowers from the ecuator and tropics and and other one which is northern. My family and I (and an 10 yr old girl and 12 yr old boy) are from Switzerland and the U.K. so seeing the dome with northern vegatation, edelweiss flowers etc was not really a thrill. We are an outdoor family so none of this was particularly unusual or special for us. However this was very very popular with Asian families. The other tropical dome was in contrast very interesting for us. So it really all comes down to where you come from, what you are familiar with. As the old adage goes: ""it's all in the eye of the beholder"".On another note, we were all left feeling rather sad after visiting. Garden by the Bay have an Orwellian feeling to it. Everything is so organized, perfectly manicured and slightly 'artificial'. Hopefully we don't destroy the world so much that we end up only being able to see some of this fascinating flora in places like this."
Maybe great for botanic experts but not for me. Nothing natural and tbe light and sound show was ok too. Nothing special
"This place is way too sanitised for me. I kept thinking of all the insects and animals that are missing from the place. That said, it is very pretty to walk through and would be nice to experience if you are shopped out, have kids or just want to avoid any fauna. The light show at night made me feel like I was in Disneyland not nature. And I don't really mean that in a good way. But I think that was the Andrew Lloyd Webber music that did that as much as all the faux trees."
Cool infrastructures. It was a fun place. Good for relaxing ang unwinding. Its a view of nature and water transformations.
"Wish we had visited in the day too, the night show was really pretty with the lights and music very relaxed atmosphere."
"overall average, nothing unique/extraordinary/special specially for people coming from sub continent (INDIA), u get to see type of vegetation which is available almost throughout India."
Had to visit while in Singapore but wasn't really wowed at all. Entrance fee was high for a walk around the greenhouses but there were some interesting plants and it was well put together. Very busy but facilities were clean and plentiful.
"First time there, very nice design but a bit overprice. We only need less than 2 hours to go around the park. Not worth the price."
Cultivating and maintaining a garden artificially inside domes is very difficult and they do the job very well.But wat is missing is the real nature in it. Pls have gud walking shoes as it will also be cold inside and u also have to walk a lot.. one time experience it cud be..
Many people in the dome and the temperature in Cloud Dome is too low bring jacket with you in your bag to comfort yourself.
"Lovely planting and different gardens. We rode around on the Audi bus tour which was great and saved us walking. I would definitely recommend this method of getting around to anyone with mobility issues or anyone who simply wants to take it easy. To be honest though whilst it was nice, it was nothing more than than that. Even when you'd seen the mushroom trees it wasn't spectacular enough and erred on the boring side...and we love gardens."
"Hate to buck the trend but having visited plenty of botanic gardens and natural parks in cities around the world, there is something a little artificial about this place that is unnerving - canned nature if you like (it is Singapore after all). It's not cheap and the walk on the elevated boardwalk is pretty poor value. The piped music in the giant conservatory is morose and just adds to the feeling that this what ""nature"" will look like 50 years from now.... Restaurants on site are also very ordinary, so overall i would not recommend a visit."
"This place is lovely. You should walk around and take in all that's free first, then you can decide to pay for the rest. The light show is nice and it's at the end of the evening.What turned me off is the typical b.s. Having two prices. One for foreigners, one for locals.Apparently price discrimination is allowed in Singapore - I guess only Japan knows how to treat guests."
"Gardens by the bay is an average experience compared to other things that can be done in Singapore. It is divided into different zones , out of which some are free to access and some have paid entry. Amongst the paid entries are the ones to the flower Dome , Rainforest Dome and the Supertree Groves. If you are pressed for time you should go to the flower Dome and can do away with the others."
"A great place. However, for the actual walks you have to pay an entrance fee, and if I understood the signs correctly, they charge tourists more than locals. Is that discrimination?"
"Amazing indoor gardens that u can visit all year round and closes at 9pm. Visited the cloud forest (with an indoor waterfall) and the flower dome. The flowers at the flower dome change all year round. It was tulips in April, and orchids in August in celebrations of Singapore national day.The outdoor supertrees area also have performance a few times each day. I watched the light show performance at 9pm.Nice place to go chill out before a public holiday. Also worth it to get the annual pass as the flowers change frequently throughout the year"
"As the heading states; the gardens are nice looking and makes for a nice morning or midday walk. However, it is nothing spectacular. If you do go to Gardens by the bay make sure you take the lift up to the skywalk. The skywalk was easily the best part of our tour."
"We book ticket from their website which are cheaper than buying on site. View are fantastic, plant and flower from all over the world, not an usual view of plant. It's so romantic places to visit, especially the waterfall with sky walk.The sad back are the transportation, where you can take an cab to the place, but you are not able to take an cab out. Either, you pay and take their shuttle to Marina or you walk to Marina, then only you can hike an cab."
"I think this is a nice spot to go to during the day to cool off. The cloud forest is nice and cool. It is pleasant to walk among all the plants, but if you are not that into botany, it is just average. We did not get to see the light show at night, due to weather."
"We came to Singapore for a couple of days and was advised by many people to go to the orchid flower garden by the bay. So on our final evening we asked up to the bay.As t was 7:15, The ticket office advised that we would only have time to see the one of two domes. Last admission was 8:30. So we decided to see the cloud mountain (advised by them). It was breathtaking! We both absolutely loved t and there were plenty of opportunities to have photos taken. It was lovely and cool by the waterfall too!.When we came out it was 8:10! Still enough time to see the orchid garden then (as I stated before-last admissions at 8:30) it would however have meant that we had to pay full price again rather than discount for 2...... the ticket office was closed!?!!!!! They wouldn't let us in. Heartbroken is an understatement as we had to fly home without seeing it."
"The gardens are good for people who love nature and not for people who get bored easily, very nice place to go for a few hours. Entrance fees are cheap and they have a places to get cold drinks"
"Sure it's pretty. Sure it's new and exciting. Sure the light show at night is impressive..But a middle of the day tour was too hot and not very exciting. We didn't go in any of the glasshouses as we only had limited time, but we did the automated vehicle ride (way too short and not informative) and the high tree walk which was scary!Overall though, too hot to walk around outside too much and if you're not into flowers and plants, probably not much for you here."
Nothing awing. Been to nicer places. Artificial forests and gardens. The light show at nice was pretty though
We waited an hour ahead to get a spot for the OCBC light and sound show. The weather was too hot out there and the performance was nothing impressive if you've seen Disney fireworks at night. It's a free show though. You need to pay separately to get into flower Dome and supertree. Getting out after the show was horrible as it was too crowded. Gardens by the bay is walking distance to Bayfront station.
It may be impressive for people who have not been to a tropical forest. Otherwise it was not that spectacular. Online ticket redemption process was confusing. Instruction for redeeming ticket when ticket was bought online was not helpful. Wasted a bit of time at the ticket counter.
"The place is gorgeous at night with the colourful lights and the background of the Singapore Flyer. However, I find it quite stuffy at times from the crowds of people and with little wind during my visit and by the time we left, we were soaking sweat! But that really is just weather issue. Still worth a visit and do make time for the Dome which we missed. It is indoor with air cond from what I read."
"As I have mentioned good place to take a look around. But a bit more natural touch like hiking, some ups and downs, some slippery places few flying birds would have been great."
"If you are a big garden fan then this is a must see experience. If however you just like gardens in an average way then this may become a bit boring. There are 2 domes and once inside each dome you have to conduct the whole tour , no skipping past and cutting out sections. The displays are lovely and we especially enjoyed the cloud forest which is as it says a tropical forest indoors. Waterfall is very well done. Flower garden was maybe one garden too many for us but Evening light show is worth staying for. 7.45 and 8.45 , lasts about 30 minutes. Bit of a crowd leaving but it is manageable."
"Felt odd to me, a variety of Andrew Lloyd Webbers music to a glashing a ray of lights leaping up down and across tree/flower like structures. Worth seeing but wouldn't go again."
I had mixed feelings seeing the contact young kids are having with nature is on concrete walkway admiring flowers and vegetation from a distance snapping pics on their cellphone under a comfortable AC environment.....
Personal feel the place and environment is nice and well created. Just the weather I'm unable to take it. The weather is too hot for me.
"I live in Singapore and have been to Gardens by the Bay dozens of time to spend time with family, A++."
"A good place to go to especially in a hot weather like Singapore as the gardens are cooling inside. In different months of the year, different themes and seasons of flowers will be displayed so you may want to check it out when is the blossoming time to visit before you go."
"A biggish indoor place with flora from the world over. Many get excited by this, and still many don't. Take your call. You won't mind giving it a miss if plants et al are not a big deal for you.A big negative was too many selfie-takers with/without their sticks. You literally can't take 3 steps without photo bombing someone's click. But you get used to it soon, and excuse yourself and move on, while the selfie-takers try another shot."
"Good place to visit if you like to see plants or flowers. The entrance fee is quite expensive. Inside Garden by the bay, there is a treetops walk and a cool house that has temperate plants from other countries. During the flower festival the organisers will also import different flower to create a wonderful atmosphere. Inside the glass dome, you will also see a man-made waterfall. For food there are also a number of restaurants nearby. It is a wonderful place to take pictures, but the entrance is pricey."
"Seeing the lights of this attraction from my hotel made me want to see what all of the hoopla was about. As always all of the good stuff required an entrance fee, so we opted not to view those parts. The gardens are amazing. Just a wonder that all of this can be created by man. They have a boardwalk near some water that I would caution taking young children to. It has no guardrail and is right up against the water. A McDonald's is available for you to purchase food with a few food/snack vendors throughout the park. You can get here via the MRT. Taxis are readily available."
This is a beautiful place.I recommend to come here at afternoon.The place is very big.Don't forget your water
"Lots of ponds, trees, flowers, and food. Saw otters eating fish and playing by the water. The walks were relaxing. Well signed and every path leads everywhere. too busy at night, but the supertrees look amazing all lit up."
"Standing in the Gardens by the Bay, looking up to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel makes you feel you're in the future. This is the impressive part, the less impressive one are the 'Hawker's' close to the water. You can smell the stinky toilets, the tables are sticky and the food is too expensive compared to the other Hawkers in the city."
I expected this to be amazing but in reality it was a bit disappointingSpread over a large area so lots of walkingAll seemed more of the sameBest bit was the forest dome which was really well done
Killed a couple of hours here whilst visiting Singapore on business. Fascinating place with a different take on plants and wildlife.The main park is free to wander around and well worth a visit. Spotlessly clean and very easy to get to on foot off Marina Bay. Give it a go!
"I was expecting something larger based on my visits to the botanical gardens and the national reserve parks. It's well done, but somehow lacks the wow factor!"
It was nice to walk around and see but really wasn't worth it. Luckily went with friends so made trip a little better. The light show was definitely not worth the time.
"Gardens by the bay was a lovely huge garden, it's a lot of walking but there is a shuttle which will take you round at a cost, not very expensive so worth it if your not up to walking, lots of things to look at in the garden, if walking at least a couple of hours, super tree grove was amazing to look at, the show at 19:45 and 20:45 is abit of a let down, it felt like it finished before it had even started, its over in about 15 minutes, the atmosphere is amazing while there as a big crowd does gather but it's very open we had a wheelchair and so much room to move around didn't feel overcrowded at all. There is ramps and lifts to get around but you just sometimes need to look for them, didn't find anywhere we couldn't go,"
"I purchased tickets for the 2 domes, the flower dome was the one worth visiting. I would suggest one might drop the cloud dome. As there was not much to see, except for the water fall and the ""sky walk"", that's all.for the flower dome, they did provide the audio guide (with a fee). I regretted on not getting it, as they did not put signage introducing the plants! And I got to know about the audio guide thing only after I was admitted.It was quite a hassle if to return back to customer service office to get it. The ticketing staff should have mentioned, or there should be signage placed at dome's entrance.The flower dome was a nice garden, people were allowed to roam around freely. I would rather they suggested a routing for people to go. There were tours at 11am and 3pm. I checked with staff for the 3pm tour (at 2:55pm), they asked me to wait in front of the signage, when more people started to gather, we were told the tour was started already! I wished they could be more organized!both domes were well-ventilated, a very comfortable environment in fact.Just if you are with kids or elderly, the walk from MRT / bus to the ticketing office was quite something. The walk might take you 20-25 mins (under the sun). Be prepared for it.admission for adults for 2 domes was charged at $28, and one might worth exploring the 1-year membership offer (now $34, was $68)."
"Amazed by the presentation of the beauty of nature. Perfect for kids. My 6 year old sister just kept on wow-ing at the sightof the falls, landscape, plants, flowers, and tge supertrees.What I was looking for though after appreciating their beauty were the names of the flowers and interesting facts about them. Though, there were some scattered around, I hoped each kind flower was given space for interesting facts about them.When we came this June 2017, the flower dome featured the Blue Beauties from the Australian, South African, English gardens. We were told then that the previous one had cherry blossoms of East Asia and the one before that were the tulips of Holland. Definitely would want to come back for these if I still dont have the budget to see the real thing hehe.It's a really nice place for nature lovers because almost all, if not all, plants and flowers in a specific season are here! For those who havent been in a place with a lot of flowers, this would be a nice introduction to the real scenes! :)Hope I didnt confuse anyone. I'm not saying they're not real. I meant to say they are not in their natural scene since the domes are handmade and their positions are arranged. :)"
"One cannot help but be impressed by the enormous time, effort, money and engineering expertise that must have gone into building this massive indoor garden, but the result is weirdly sterile. I did not see a single insect in the entire place, and the effect was one of lifelessness, as if the plants were more sculpted than cultivated. Moreover, both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are so heavily air conditioned that after an hour inside each I was cold and glad to leave. I wondered whether the air con is for patrons' benefit or to maintain the plants in optimum condition (presumably the former; wouldn't the plants do better in a slightly steamier environment?). Within the Flower Dome, there were a few signs informing patrons what each plant was, but not enough of them. The date palms were very beautiful, but looked almost as though they had been assembled by hand. The assortment of dining venues were poor in quality and overpriced. All in all, I was a bit disappointed."
"This is our second visit to Gardens by the Bay. The first one was during the Christmas festive season last year to see the lights and to visit the Flower Dome. This recent visit was to the Cloud Forest and to see the Gardens turns 5 celebratory performances.Needless to say, the free Gardens turns 5 performances have attracted a huge crowd as it has been widely advertised and is free for all to view. However, sad to say, the crowd control inside Cloud Forest (which is a ticketed area) was disastrous. There was massive human traffic build up at every level of the Cloud Forest, making it uncomfortable to walk and noisy. The Cloud Forest is beautiful but we found the experience to be extremely disappointing simply because it was impossible to appreciate what it has to offer. There should have been better crowd control measures in placed seeing how visitors like ourselves are encouraged to purchase the tickets online prior."
Visited early evening so had the benefit of day time and night time views - would recommend this to all visitors. The light show was very disappointing and not worth staying for. You have to pay extra for the aerial walkway between the tall trees but this is probably one of the best parts of the attraction.
It do not have amazing feel if you go there more than twice. The first appearance is good but after that you will feel like nothing special. This is mainly for the flower & forest dome. Overall the outdoor park is huge and takes time for people to explore it. It's less crowded during weekdays and less activity there.
"The Gardens is rated as the no 1 tourist attraction in Singapore and we may have expected to much. The gardens are pretty, but not unique or something we had never seen before. The restaurants were subpar and Lau Par Sat being better than Satay by the Bay"
"The park in itself is a beauty and a great relief from the concrete jungle; right behind the Sands Hotel and MRT conveniently located its very easy to reach. The tickets however were a pain, where in there are separate tickets for each section of the park and they were expensive too I felt! Otherwise a great escape for the whole family, lot of photo ops!"
"The gardens are pretty but very, very concrete and man made. They weren't quite what I envisioned. I really enjoyed walking around. I especially loved the Cloud Forest. You can do it on a budget. If your tight like me you can walk around for free but it is very hot and all of the extras like the pretty air conditioned domes cost extra."
"My family went on the last week of May and we expected a lot since the place is renowned for its beautiful selection of plants and flowers. Adding to the overpopulation of people during the time of our visit, the place looked very dull and bare and some plants were already rotting. $28 in my opinion is overpriced. The only good takeaway from this place was the free Star Wars themed light show at the Supertree grove at night."
"Great selections of flowers and overall pleasant experience. The only complain is site accessibility, too little exit points, so there was a huge number of people leaving the site at the same time. Stuffy and hot, not a great way to end the visit."
"Nice open space for a walk not far from the city centre. Slightly cooler than other places due to the breeze from the sea. Visited flower dome and it was ok, but not a lot of new flowers (if you are used to flowers in Europe)."
"For an American who lives in Europe, gardens by the bay was just too artificial for me. It feels like people should get out and explore real nature rather than going inside to an air conditioned, artificial garden that is made to look like you are hiking around outside (cloud walk). It's a tourist hot spot, so if you're going for selfies, it ticks that box! Otherwise, go out and explore the real deal...Mother Nature!"
"It was a little bit funny to go into a garden where they cool down the temperature and reduce the humidity and see the flowers from home, means from Europe ( that's the opposite we have in Europe).For fans of flowers not bad.For myself the Hardrock Cafe outside was more intereessting ."
"Great place.The air con was cold and blasted, even on a rainy dark day, especially in the cloud forest.Wish we didn't have to walk so far from the main basement parking lot to the entrance booth. Difficult for elderly lady we brought.Be prepared to walk a lot. There are trams but not sure they are meant to transport people around the complex. The staff could not provide much explanation either.They need more informed and friendlier staff. Like pretty much at most places in Singapore, the people are rather rude, not friendly,and do not really understand English. My family all concurred with this experience."
A treat for the eyes and a memory of lifetime. It is one of the attractions you should never miss. More gardens of this type should showcase Singapore as a green city.
"Imagine cactus doing such a visual treat .And So neatly done like a dreamworld .All fresh ,no dead leaves .Supertree were amazing"
A must sightseeing is the cloud forestThe flower dom is not as great .The surrounding gardens are an excellent marriage between architicture and nature
Visited the forest area after all the recommendations. It was so over hyped and didn't deserve the praises it recieved. Would totally recommend to skip this touristy place.
"I walked around the gardens an entire day looking for the kind of tranquil you get at the Botanic gardens, this is just too engineered like an amusement park. Very well at that, it has brought in a whole lot of animal species, which is amazing!"
Only meant for the nature lovers!People not interested will be bored and wondering why you spent money on seeing trees and plants!But I would say it is worth going one time!
Cloud forest is great and a must see. Flower dome is just another green house with a garden. The light and sound show in supertree grove is over rated. don't waste your time waiting for it. its ok if you are around in there at that time. Staff is very well organised and tourist friendly. We lost a camera bag but we found it at the visitor center. Kudos to the staff for being vigilant and helpful
The gardens as such are nothing exceptional if you have visited gardens and parks around the world. What's interesting to see and learn about are the super trees and how they function in order to sustain the gardens - and not only.
"We only had 2 days in Singapore and wanted to view the magnificent tree structures we had seen in photographs and enjoy the peace from the busy city.It does look amazing from every angle, however tourists in abundance it might be better to ascertain when the ""quieter"" times would be. Accessed via the Marina Bay Sands hotel and down an escalator this is a free activity.However, the heavens opened when we reached here and we jostled for space under the tiny canopy over the lift entrance - this was a really heavy downpour indeed and we didn't have an umbrella. There was no where to go and the interest in the gardens soon faded.The public toilets in the gardens are too small for the number of visitors accessing. I queued for 20 minutes for only 2 ladies toilets - only 1 of these was an actual conventional we. The heat and humidity was very high yet the only electronic fan is over 1 wash hand basin.We didn't end up walking round to see the area at its fullest due to the rain - it rained for 2-3 hours both afternoons so perhaps they should provide umbrellas or more sheltered areas to take cover."
Went there on a lovely day- beautiful place really cool gardens but struggles to excite the average dude.Glad I went but it isn't earth shattering.Skywalk is overpriced.
"Was there for the last day of our trip in Singapore... By this time we have learnt that Singapore is not just the most expensive city in the world, but the most greedy.Everything costs money. And asking people who work there if something else will also require a fee, is no help.So the place is pretty, but paying 25 dollars to see two of the 4 attractions should at least include things like shuttles. Rather skip this one and go enjoy the amazing food."
it is best to visit the area by night. Make sure that you are on the area before the schedule musical. Place is become crowded during this time. Stampede on the stair is possible. Hope a guard will monitor the movement of people.
If you like gardens you will like gardens by the bay. Otherwise it's a bit average! Worth a quick visit if nothing else.
Only thing nice about Garden by the Bay is the evening light show. It is slightly expensive @ 22 SGD. But it is worth the amount.Dont miss it.
Nice way to spend an afternoon. Kids have a great area to play in .Satay market has delicious food and drinks
Worth for once in a lifetime visit.. best time to visit is not mid afternoon. Nice place to relax. You can just walk or take the 3$ shuttle.
"Nice garden but we didnt went inside since its the same experience you can have in Singapore parks in day time BUT what is amazing and makes it unique is the night view when those artificial art piece trees illuminated, thats something. Best viewing is to look out from the terrace at Marina Bay Sands where you have access to garden. A nice to see activity when visiting Singapore."
An interesting park; look forward to seeing how the 'trees' look when the climbing plants are fully grown. The greenhouses appeared to be a great attraction to Asian visitors as they had collections of European spring flowers when I visited. The tulips were a highlighted feature.
"Nice to take photos at around 6pmGet some light and change of colour at the skytrees.Note the place is huge, has many entrances please be specific which part you want to go to.Didn't go further in to comment."
We spent 3 hours here because this place is simply amazing but unfortunely we can't go to OCBC due to the rain so we were a bit dissapointed:(
I am more impressed with the functionality of the trees than what they look like. It it still an artificial bunch of trees. Mostly impressive at nighttime.
"Apparently the Singapore state spent big bucks in creating Gardens by the Bay. And it's nice. Lot's and lots of plants, trees and what have 'ya.Save some time not going up to the tree-top walk. It's just what the name implies, walkway hanging high in the air. Thats it.The garden is like Singapore, very nice but at the same time a bit artificial."
"Close to Marina Bay Sands, this is a nice place for a walk. There are some interesting shops and atractions as well."
"""Nice""... kind of a bland word, hey?! Singapore may be applauded for its conservation and sustainability efforts. Yet, somehow this experience has left me thinking that I should definitely visit the Botanical Gardens. I'm more of an actual ""natural nature"" person methinks. The flower dome was good - particularly liked the baobabs and the variety of tulips. The cloud dome was okay. Again... I like ""natural"" waterfalls :) I didn't stay for the sound and light show (which would be beginning around exactly now, as I write this review)..."
"This is a good place to go with kids - there is a children's garden with playground and big water play area. You can also walk around in the man-made park and look at different trees and plants. It is a nice day out if you live in Singapore/stay long, but I wouldn't say it's high on the list if you are only visiting for a few days."
"I think that the price is not worth it. It is just like a huge garden. I didn't enjoy much maybe because my country has better things to offer when it comes to nature tripping. Since the facility is man-made and unnatural, I wouldn't recommend going here but I enjoyed the lights show."
Gardens by the Bay is a 1 time visit kind of a tourist venue...it means everything interesting can be viewed in a day..best time to go is during the later part of the day so that you can also enjoy the sunset in the evening
"Took my grandchildren here for the day, lots to see and do plus they gave a superb water park to finish the day in. All in all worth a visit."
"Ok. Remember to bring cash if you want to buy food. Good for walking in night time, but we arrived to late to enjoy the attractions."
"Visit during events / festive in the garden - make it more interesting and better photos. Bring your own water bottle, able to refill in garden. A lot of walking. Not bad after all."
"Everyone speeks about it, we found it nice but not a must have seen. The big trees surely have a special value for the town, but even with the laser show it is not very interesting."
Its hard to buy tickets to get into most things. Was told to buy online and when i did i didnt receive the e ticket so it was a hassle trying to get in. The cloud dome was ok. The other one wasnt at all impressive. The towerlike things were impossible to get to.Really pretty place but the experience overall wasnt as pleasant as it shouldve been.
"Both domes are pretty nice but I was excepting more from them. More vegetation, more explanations/descriptions especially for the price."
"Nice place to chill and see the flowers around. But it was a bad timing that we arrived on the wrong timing, as they were closing the flower dome which made us have to go there for the second time on next day. Which is very troublesome as we need to go back to our own country on next day.As for the staff, we asked if the ticket could be changed to other entrance (flower dome to the flower tower or something) and its ok to top up if needed but they just said no and asked us go back to the agent to ask for refund. If we have the time for that, we wouldnt have asked you for this request. Should have asked with their supervisor for this assist or its hard to get improvement and felt like being shoo off"
"As I said - my husband does not like ""gardens"" so we opted not for a tour but just to walk around - it was very hot and humid so we didn't last long - really should have stayed longer and paid to go up to the dome and seen more. Have also been told (and can now see for ourselves) that we should have gone late afternoon and seen sunset and the evening light shows"
Unless you pay for the shuttle it is quite a lot of walking in the hot weather. And they also charge $30 to go into the cool room which is extortionate in my opinion. So a little overrated.
"Lovely green park where you can walk four hours and enjoy the view. Only downside are the number of people everywhere, it gets quite busy."
"Visited to see the sunset over the city, went to the cocktail bar, basically over priced, noisy, slow service and 10 minute wait for change once paid. Hopefully a bad evening when we went. However scenery over the city and gardens at night was stunning."
"The visit to the gardens worth it, but not to get in to the domes. It's really small places. The forest they try to create is really a deception, because it's a garden not a forest at all and the air conditioner make the experience really weird. But probably that the idea of forest for them. I don't know. But I didn't like it at all. It's expensive for what is given. But the artificial trees is amazing! Worth seeing during the day and night! Really interesting and it's for free."
"We went to the garden's show at 7:30 pm, the garden was really lighting up at night, beautiful tree lighting show."
We went on a weekend and it was busy. That would normally not bother us. It was more the selfish behaviour of people taking selfies in the flower dome and cloud Forrest. Definitely choose a quieter time if you want to wander and actually see the plants and experience the cloud Forrest. Plenty of space to walk around the super trees though.
"This garden is an excellent concept, but subject to seasonal variations. At the time of my visit, a lot of plants and flowers were going out of season while others were coming in. Hence, some flowers could not be on display. The cactus garden is spectacular and more permanent. Overall a good place to visit. Combine the visit with ""Cloud Forest"". Might be a good idea to inquire about the condition while planning the visit."
a nice place in the middle of a mega city. we did not however visit the orchard garden. connects to marina bay sands by a foot over bridge so if you get tired you can just go relax at one of the many restaurants at the mall
"Clean, beautiful place to walk through, usually crawling with happy kids chasing after whatever attraction may be in at the time - huge pink moving dinosaurs, a tiny train, a mini amusement park, a hovering baby."
"This is very beautiful and a must see when in Singapore, but i'd only do it once as its $28 to go into the 2 flower domes which i think is a little excessive. But hey if you like flowers, then do it :)"
"Went here on my last trip to singapore with family.I entered both the rain forest and flower dome.Both have a great facilities. But personally i don't think that i will come to this place again. Particularly because back in my country, we have lots of natural forest, garden and park. And we think that they're far much better than artificial one in Singapore."
"We visited here specifically to see the large trees that are so famous in Singapore. But due to lack of information when we were there and walking through all of these domes with gardens, fauna and trees in them (and lacking interest) we left early and didn't even make it to the walkway to walk around the trees.I wished we have been given more information on this.... that said the place is beautiful if you like flowers and gardens and definitely worth visiting.But don't miss the walk way!!! :-)"
"Really rather disappointing. The cloud forest and gardens aren't all that impressive especially when you can go to the botanical gardens, a world heritage site, for free. Obviously designed to cater to the cruise passengers. The garishly painted dinosaur models tell you all you need to know about the quality and intention of this place. Skip it in favor of the botanic gardens and art museum."
"I went to Gardens by the bay expecting more. The gardens were nice, but not outstanding. The light show is great for families, though and I would saw that that we a fun part of my trip to the Gardens. The area is interesting."
"It's like going around the mountains in the big city. It's just simply amazing and relaxing at the same time. If you are a nature lover, you would love the different species of plants around the gigantic gardens."
"The free garden is nice, but you have to pay for the skywalk. I didn't visit the domes for lack of time"
"Not worth paying to get inside the dome or anything else. Save your money ,do the free part . You see some flowers in nice arrangement but nothing special"
We probably visited at the wrong time of year but were disappointed by the lack of colour everywhere. Everything was green. We did not go into the domes as we had walked all over Singapore and were too tired to spend the entrance fee. It looked like a fantastic place to bring kids who seemed to be having a lot more fun than us!!Maybe it looks better in the summer
A good experience for people who would like to see some flora in Singapore all in one place. The domes are beautiful. A bit pricey though when it comes to food. Pack snacks! Especially for those with kids!
"great area, lots to see and experience, for all ages.BUT the pay attractions are very very pricey, even by Singapore standards.Plenty of free areas, good coffee at Cafe Crema with apple pie, plenty of orchids and other plant life; made us glad we skipped the orchids at the botanical gardens. There are some very good free areas to get a high view of most of the area. Also lots of animated dinosaurs for kids, interesting rockwork and timber, rustic, furniture. Photographers will have a ball."
Worth a visit every season with its rotation of flowers and exhibits. Recommend to purchase food from local supermarkets as food can be quite pricy there.
Sorry but I felt that this experience was far too expensive and looked fake and contrived all the way.
"Like most attractions in Singapore, there seems to be very little of Singapore's culture, heritage or natural gifts included in Gardens by the Bay. It's almost Dubai-esque, as it has been purpose built to impress and entertain tourists. It was nice to look at, but Sentosa had natural forests that were loads better."
Spectacular but artificial.Overpriced. National Orchid Garden is far more worth to visit. The only good walk was outside the ticketed structures. and free.
Would have gave it more but a bit expensive to see domes but very well done any country would be glad to have this in there city and we would recommend
"The Gardens by the Bay is beautiful and must be visited during the night though I must admit that the view is much better from a hotel/building nearby.When I was in the heart of the ""gardens"", I didn't feel it was beautiful at all. That said, you can take some good pictures of the Marina Bay Sands.However, don't go there too late during the night or you may not be able to take the skyway which I'm sure makes the gardens much more beautiful."
"It was a wet afternoon and so it seemed a good choice. Singapore is an easy city to get round, plentiful and cheap taxis. The architecture of the place is amazing. However we left feeling that there was something missing. It was pretty crowded with the Asian tendency for selfies at every flower that does become tedious. Many of the flowers were in small pots similar to the ones you buy at a garden centre. It is also cool under the glass, certainly not what we expected and it is also pretty expensive to get in. The waterfall is great and the walk in the cloud forest is good too. There is minimal signage and for me too much chrome and not enough nature. We were looking forward to it but for us, it never delivered the experience anticipated."
You will enjoy but not spend much time over there.Eat ice-cream outsideUse your time in the shopDo not expect much from stalactite and stalagmites
"The tour itself was wonderful BUT . . . First I booked on line which went smoothly enough until the site said there were limited hotel pickups. Nowhere on the site did it mention which hotels these were so undaunted and somewhat hopefully filled in my credit card details and hoped we were one of the chosen few. We weren't! So a day later Viator emailed me with an address as to where we could pick up the tour, at the coach pickup at the gardens by the bay at 6:30. With help from the concierge at the hotel we left with plenty of time to find the drop off or pickup point. Nobody T the gardens knew of Viator so we sat at the spot and waited and waited, stalking anybody who looked likely. Eventually I spied a lady with RMG tours who looked like she might know about a competing travel company and help us out. Low and behold our na,es were on her list. We were going on a RMG tour. If it had been up to my husband who would never have asked we would never have known. Very confusing and stressful start to an otherwise excellent tour."
Got picked up by bus from my hotel and taken to the gardens. The ticket covered entry to the gardens which were OK but the highlight was the free lightshow outside later on in the evening it was like something out of the movie Avatar. Afterwards you need to find your own way home.
"Went on a Sunday to the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest with much anticipation since I've heard good reviews about.The Flower Dome was pretty much a let down as I was anticipating to be wowed by a plethora of beautiful vintage blooming colors. But no... what I saw were mainly green and the flowers were not aplenty. Nothing much to take photographs of. We finished walking in like 15mins albeit trying to take our time already. I guess it would make more sense to visit the Flower Dome when there's special flower seasons like tulips etc... just my guess.The Cloud Forest welcomed us with a waterfall - nice. We walked around and up to the lost world. Wanted to take the lift up since I'm pregnant but was curtly turned away by the attendant who told us to take the stairs as we walked towards the lift. My husband didn't like that, but I later saw the sign that the lift is only for elderly and people carrying kids. Though I too think they should allow expecting women to use the lift too and the staff attitude was a little off. The plants were a sight; but that's about it. There's a crystal display but it's nothing impressive.Overall, there is no wow factor in both the domes. It was like paying $20 for just a walk in the park."
"I am sure any other time the Flower Dome would have been nice, just not last Monday. The counter didnt tell us that the dome was in the middle of display change. This will have made us change dates. There were no flowers except sunflowers, which were on their way of wilting. All this time of visits to Singapore, this was our first time here, and so while we enjoyed the greenery, the cactus and trees and sculptures, we were hoping for flowers, amazing blooms, since tag line says, 'forever spring,' or some such, in exchange for our 14 SGD. This wasn't so. There was an apologetic waiver inside, but how to refund when you have already gotten in? I am sure for many who haven't been to the botanical gardens will be amazed and all, but we simply cannot enjoy a flower dome without flowers. The poster advertising was, is, also incredibly misleading. Where are those blooms? The walk to the supertrees were incredibly worth it though at 8 SGD, and with discount, at 6 SGD. Will probably come back next time, and see about those blooms, but for everyone else, be mindful of any waiver. Also call counter ahead for when the domes close. The announcement, e.g., cloud forest, is on the website. Tip: Many of the attractions in Singapore close on a Monday, so be sure to check ahead of visit."
"It's too hot and humid for us to walk around these 10+ different out-door gardens(free of charge) so we took $8 Garden Cruiser. Those gardens each carried a theme name like Indian garden, Chinese Garden, Colonial Garden, World of Palms, secret Life of Tree, etc. A spectacular view!"
I think this attraction is best watched either from the flyer or from the rooftop of Marina Sands Bay
For most people who have been to Botanical Gardens or have an interest in gardening the plant material seemed rather ordinary. The man made trees lit at night are quite pretty but it is quite a bit of effort without much gain
"The average rating is simply due to the fact this attraction is not really for me. I visited due to the high ratings on Tripadvisor.The gardens are clean, well laid out and are very extensive."

"Everyone in Singapore recommended this place as a must-see attraction. It is basically an indoor botanical garden with a few additional features such as a waterfall, decorative flowerbeds, educational films etc. Whilst it is very nice it certainly doesn't deserve all the hype the locals seem to give it. If you are going then discounted tickets are available online so don't pay full price. As you'd expect there's a giftshop with some seriously expensive souvenirs and a very crowded McDonald's."
"We were probably expecting too much, having visited the botanic gardens the day before ! Pleasant enough but more expensive, and a lot of the stuff in the flower dome was quite familiar to us as Europeans, so not that interesting. The skywalk was worth going to for the views though !"
"The free gardens are so so, if you want to make it worth the trip you have to pay for the big attractions. Non Singaporean folk must pay for both the paid attractions, which is a bit pricey, but then it's Singapore after all. They looked impressive but we didn't pay the 28 dollars each to see them. Go at night to see the light show for free from the footbridge across from Marina Sands hotel - too many photographers for my liking but then I don't like photographers. Don't go in the hot day. It was ok."
The large metal trees in the park are loosing the greem plants and are looking very bare. Very sad to see the plants dying on these super trees. Hope something can be done to make the plants grow up all the way to the canopy part of the structures - otherwise you may as well remove them. Let's wait and see....
"So popped over to gardens by the bay, we only went to the cloud forest which was beautiful but quite cold. I wouldn't say it was the highlight of our trip but as we had time we didn't mind. There's a lovely waterfall and plenty of flora and fauna. There is also a little interactive feature on climate change. We also went to the light show at the super tree grove, this was fun. Everyone just either sat or lay on the floor and watched the show. It's not as spectacular as say the musical fountains in Dubai but it's still beautiful."
It was hectic. Depends up to your nature and hobby. If looking for different type of flowers and all can go.
"In the previous years of visit, Christmas Wonderland were accessed free for all that's why when we get there, we were surprised that it requires a ticket to get it. We're fine to pay for tickets but they have not alloted at least a ticketing counter to accommodate those guests who has no access to online booking."
"fresh air, loads of space, water vapor fans, great for cycling route. not for the faint hearted to walk the whole park. it's so far from MBS and the whole place lacks big, clear directional signs. all in all just a majestic park. for the botanic lovers. by all means try the skywalk, but it's not that high."
"Not much to see, just a basic garden. Plans from all over the world. Not that impressive display and not much flower blossom in January. Building is beautiful outside.Very cold beer at the bar.Not must see place for group of gents."
"However, it feels so artificial... not natural at all. There are also too many unruly tourists from PRC who were squeezing around those poor flowers and plants, just to get a good selfie of themselves."
"I have brought friends here a few times and is a simple place with nice greenery. At night the lights are beautiful and the view is good. Its free only for the outside so if you are close by, why not?"
This is quite a different thing to do. Totally artificial but filled with plants both inside and outdoors. Well worth 3 hours
Interesting set up. Suggest to bring something to keep u warm as we were freezing in our singlets and shorts.
This place is a great attraction for tourist and if you are lucky to be there in a pleasant evening the open space and tall lighting trees just make your day. After dark when lights are on this really looks attractive. They lights also runs in tune with the music and music across the world. But not sure if you would like to visit more than once.
"The Gardens are beautifully maintained. The trees are not particularly impressive during daytime. There are two glasshouses, 1 supposedly houses a tropical forest but besides some green bushes, some flowers and a waterfall there isn't much to see or do. The other one is more interesting with many varieties of beautiful flowers. If you want the stroll the skywalk that's an extra admission."
"I have little doubt that a sunny day would have resulted in a four or five star review. But for those wondering what it's like in the rain, here goes...Without the light from the sunshine, the colors are muted and although warm, being in the wet is little fun. The idea of the gardens is great and there is a lot of variety in terms of fauna. I think probably a nice place to cool off when it's super hot. The rain unfortunately can make most things a little miserable."
The day before we had walked the southern ridges and I liked that a lot more. Gardens by the bay is a nice park though with a good view of the Marina Sands Bay and the Singapore flyer.
Visited the gardens soon after it was opened when things were newly installed. Made various return visits during flower exhibitons and when we brought visitors.Recent visit observations.1.service staff excellent and polite from the entrance to the interior2.there is excessive displays of wooden sculptures and drift wood. Makes one think that it was all acquired from the same source in a warehouse close out sale. These wooden items are found everywhere just to fill up empty spaces.
Worth a visit but nothing spectacular unless you are really into your flowers. Sections of gardens covering different parts of the world.
"We went there in day light and saw the artificial trees. During day it look more or less ordinary but after dark when they lit up lights, which dances on music tunes, the place becomes actually better. It looks good and you can spend some time there but to me its not more than a single visit."
"It featured in Planet Earth 2 Series by David Attenborough, there is a shuttle bus, bit we sis a lot of walking. The domes are worth visiting but unfortunately the sky walk around the 'Trees' was shut due to the weather. We got there by MRT. It's open until 2am so you can enjoy it day or night when the structure are illuminated but the domes shut at 9pm. Food for families too"
id rather see actual nature - not a man made version of it. it was freezing inside the cloud forest and flower domes. signage was very poor. they charge extra 3 dollars per person to get on the tram which takes you point to point!
"Gardens by The Bay feels rather manufactured, definitely tourist-centric. But there are interesting exhibits in the 2 paid-entry enclosures. So everyone goes for the SuperTrees, personally I'm not so impressed with man-made structures for a nature-driven attraction. So this feels more like a garden theme park than anything. F&B is expensive for what they serve and a bit contrived. Walk further afield for Satay by The Bay, much cheaper, somewhat authentic local fare.If anyone wanted to see flora in Singapore, I'd first recommend the Botanical Gardens, not so much this place."
"Went there at night as people suggested, saw the sights..love the sights but as the title said, Id enjoy this more if im a botanist or a florist"
"If you are garden lover you will enjoy going around, spending time with the nature and enjoying the music and light show in the evening, that is the wonderful attraction must to witness"
"Worth seeing, but keep your expectations reasonable. Went at night and the light show is bit blah. Still, a nice place to see and walk around. I just expected more WOW!"
"The flower dome & cloud dome are worth seeing. Even my fussy teen daughter got into the spirit and we took lots of gorgeous social-media worthy photos in the flower dome. The waterfall is spectacular. We didn't go to the super trees area-we thought it's better viewed for free from the dragonfly bridge (link to marina bay sands) at night for the sound/light show. People who don't like flowers may possibly think it boring. We were bemused by the climate change presentation, considering the global increasing population & urban sprawl problems."
"My wife and I brought our 1-year daughter to visit the Garden by the Bay. We spent totally 5mins in the two ticketed indoor gardens. Why only 5 mins? It was just two cold inside. The average temperature in Singapore is around 30c degree in daytime. A/C temperature is only around 16c degree. What did make us feel even worse? No warning on the website or before entering the gardens. Given the huge difference of temperature, a coat is definitely needed for kids and/or adult if you want to spend 1-2 hours inside.We understand that such chill environment is needed to cater the plants from other continents. Cannot you simply put a warning/notification at the entry point and website?But, why I still gave a three stars? The outdoor gardens saved the trip. I must admit that the children's garden sponsored by Far East Organization is the best kid's gardens that I ever visited. And, it is FREE.We will definitely visit this place again."
"Seemed like a must see, go to place so we went like everyone else!Pretty flowers, gardens, nice walkways but very crowded, humid, and hot...We decided to rent a stroller for our 2 year old. However, they only accept cash and turned me away when I only had a credit card. For some reason, they failed to inform me there is an ATM right outside the office."
"The entry fee to the gardens was far too expensive. However, the Big Bus night tour gave us free entry to the light show in the gardens at night. The lighting was quite a nice display especially since it was co-ordinated with the Marina Bay Towers display.However, the sound and lights didn't work well together which was a let down. The best sound and light show is still Walk of the Stars in Hong Kong."
"If you're not into plants and gardens don't bother with the domes, but the lighting display at night was great."
There is nothing like Gardens by the Bay with its immense artificial trees...beautiful to see at night and filled with bus loads of tourists throughout the day...would not be my first choice while in Singapore.
Having heard so much about Gardens on the Bay and the light show I had high expectations. I was a bit disappointed by the light show. Nothing to really write home about.The actual gardens are nice but all enclosed in a giant greenhouse. If you are used to nature on a big scale like me (I am from South Africa) it wont really blow you away. Given the lack of tourist attractions in Singapore its worth a visit.
"The two domes was a nice concept, but I felt the plants and flowers were not in their natural habitat. This won't replace hiking through a forest or a real garden. The simulated waterfall could have been better."
Visited 2 of the convervatories. Impressive but not large scaled as expected.Went in the day but may explore what's nearby the next time at night.
"I've been to Gardens by the Bay twice and while they are quite futuristic and nice, I don't understand what the fuss is about.It's overcrowded, overpriced and Singapore has Botanic Gardens which are much nicer if you ask me."
Be prepared for a crush. But a good place to get out of the heat and see something interesting. The double-deal is the best.
"Accessed by the amazing architecture of the Marina Bay Sands (check out the Flight bar in Tower 1) .A short walkway takes you to the buggy shuttle to the main attraction via the gardens. The greenery is stunning with great views back over the skyline of downtown Singapore.Expecting something rather more spectacular when we reached the flower dome and the walk through the faux rainforest.Quite honestly if you've been to the botanical and orchid gardens, and considering the rather high entrance fee, personally it is a bit of a disappointment. Having been lucky enough to have visited one or two actual rainforests yes, a great place to educate the youngsters and experience the feeling ,but rather too on the commercial side for me .Quite a lot of walking to the shuttle in steamy hot conditions but please do not take my word for it, as flower and plant enthusiasts may be blown away!"
"I guess it depends what you want from a garden, but to be honest this was a bit of a let down. OK it's spectacular giant trees are good to see but the plants didn't really leave much of an impression, just seemed to be multiple shades of green, with no real colour. We didn't go in the conservatories so can't give an opinion on what's in there, but if you want a nice walk round some lovely tidy and colourful gardens then go for a stroll round the Royal Botanical Gardens. They're free (apart from a $5 fee for the orchid garden) and in my opinion a much better use of your time in Singapore."
"Walked from Marina Mandarin over to Gardens by the Bay (quite a walk & not for the feint hearted). Reasonable price for admission but I'm not sure what I was expecting of the Flower Dome, but it didn't quite measure up. Perhaps I confused it with the Towers but overall the Flower Dome was ok, but nothing outstanding. Wouldn't pay it a second visit."
"Its a very nice location to visit, I was quite dissappointed by dirty toilets at this location, also food options are very limited especially in a restaurant located near by there are hardly any good food options to choose from, also the service in the restaurant was poor. Over for a touristic place like this basic amenities like public toilets must be kept clean, also better restaurants must be introduced."
You can't come to Singapore and leave without seeing the electric trees...especially during the holiday season.
"Overall we were quite underwhelmed with gardens by the bay. My advice would be to go down and have a look around but don't buy any tickets, we bought entry into the flower done and the cloud forest however we wished we hadn't bothered - it's quite expensive and a bit poor. You can walk around the gardens for free with no ticket and the most impressive part is the super tree grove which you can see for free by just walking over to it, definitely worth going to have a look at night when they are all lit up its very pretty but that's about it. You can also pay to go and walk around the super tree grove on a suspended walkway but again, I wouldn't really bother you get a better view from below"
"A very nice and pleasant place to be. If you're a tourist then there's a nearby metro station from where you can reach this place. The place offers a variety of exotic species of plants. It's a very big enclosure and has a wonderful fountain in it. The skywalk in it is just amazing. The aura of this place is refreshing and rejuvenating. Would love to visit this place again in future. And for the film-lovers, you might be thrilled to see this place as it has been featured in a few films too."
"This place is just a garden which has attractions within. I personally did not find the attractions very interesting, but definitely can visit once"
"Unfortunately we couldnt get on the Tree walkway. The choice of restaurants was very bad, hugh queue on the toilets..."
Nice to see but not needed to actually go there and pay 28 dollar per person for each part of the gardens. In Total it Will cost you round 70 dollar a person to see it all. Its Also Nice to go to a high building and see the gardens looking down on it.
I visited the gardens on the bay recently with friends over January break. The area is beautiful and the bridge taking you to the gardens provides a great view of the skyline. The super trees are an interesting sight during the day or at night. I would suggest not paying for the flower or cloud domes as the Singapore botanical gardens are free and have more beautiful flowers and plants (the flower dome was mostly trees and plants)
"Gardens by the Bay is good for a stroll. There are different kinds of flowers everywhere. The structures are also tall that too much look up might strain your neck. It's a good spot to take photos of Marina Bay Sands. Also, make sure to watch the lights show at night."
"The flower Dome, cloud Forest , the Christmas wonderland and the other event could sell as a package instead of buying individual ticket for the event, some of the working staff using unpleasant tone to ask me to leave as I accidently entered the event that need a ticket."
"We went to the flower and cloud enclosures $100 for 1 adult and 3 children. They are quite interesting and a cool,dry escape from the rain but we were very disappointed overall and could not agree with Trip Advisors high rating. Was it worth the money?No. Was it worth a visit?Just"
"I went during Xmas eve, so its super crowded. I expected more flowers in Flower Dome, but so-so. May be not flower season in December. It's winter, not spring. (lol) There is special Xmas event venue which required separate admission fee. Wish it is free and easy area like previous year, which no need admission fee except for taking part in games and ice-skating.Overall, Garden by the bay is good place to see nature in different perspective. It likes a magical place where all kind of flowers, trees etc planted in one place."
"Flower dome- Simple decoration with no creativity. Some sections most of the flowers dried up. Cloud dome- third visit and will be the last. Nothing special, can't see any new deco nor new species...."
"Nice view, although nowhere near as nice as top of the Marina Bay Sands... tickets to each attraction are pricey and you need to buy them separately ($36 if you want to do all three) AND it's pretty busy. Definitely NOT the best thing to do in Singapore!"
"My husband and I visited Gardens by the Bay on the last night of the Winter Wonderland exhibit. Unfortunately it was raining and crowded the whole time which made it difficult to enjoy the overall experience. We enjoyed the affordable hawker-style food market at Satay by the Bay. The gardens really are an artistic and architectural masterpiece but the special exhibits were overpriced. We bought tickets to the Winter Wonderland only to discover that we then had to pay for the activities inside. The only thing that was ""free"" after buying the ticket was the light show at night, which was limited due to the rain. Overall, it's a good free activity to visit the general exhibits."
Lots of great points concerning sustainability. However veryical farms are probably not the solution to a better and greener environment. A bit expensive to get tickets
"Impressively organized lighting. Unless you particularly want to look at the gardens in daylight, the lights are the highlight."
"We visited these on the F1 weekend which prob made it a lower score as it was so busy.The gardens are strange - also like something from Avatar the movie. They spent a load of money on the attraction and you can't help but think it was a bit of a waste. Worth going to see, there isn't more more to do in Singapore."
"Missed 2015 Christmas Wonderland @ Gardens By the Bay thus decided to visit this year 2016. 2 families out together to this seemingly fairy tale land on a week night, & surprised with the crowd.Lightings were amazingly pretty with Cinderella like lit-up castles, lots of fun fair therefore is a good treat for young kids. Though the place was nicely decorated with beautiful lights, Christmas songs, games, fun & food, we were slightly disappointed with small compound & not much attraction.We ended up had to pay $8/pax for the OCBC SkyWalk (not worthwhile) but the view was fantastically amazing! A walk suitable for the strong hearts (I couldn't take the height & came down after staying up there for 5mins) :(((A place I'll visit only once as it's too crowded and not much to see in the night"
"Having visited parks and gardens all over the world and seen nature in its natural surroudings this park doesn't ad much to it.... In the flowerdome I had hoped to see more exciting plants and colors insteads of a bunch of trees with some sparsely plants inbetween. In the park itself they were still breaking down the Christmasvillage In a way they still will be busy at the end of February...... The big forestdome is nicely build and the skyway gives a nice look over the garden. But for the best look, also over the city, you can better visit the Skydek from Marina bay Sands. The restaurants were busy and the one from who you received a voucher was so busy that you were send away.All in all I expected more of it and was a little dissapointed."
The gardens are very beautiful. We popped in after dark and the lights are amazing!Most of the park is accessible without paying. The only bits that need a ticket are the domes and the bridge so you can just wonder in when you have a bit of free time.The only reason iv given it a 3 is it was all a bit commercial for me. Had more of a Disney feel than botanical gardens but that said it was still worth going.
This is a good place for plant/flower lovers. Everything is nice and provides a break from city atmosphere. Too bad you need to pay just to see this flora.
Visited the Christmas wonderland this year with my friends around 10:30pm. We still had to pay 6 dollars to enter and enjoy for only 30 mins. It's only free entry after 11pm. My question is: is there a need for an entrance fee to see the lights only? Besides if it's located inside flower dome than i would understand.
"I visited here this evening, and i also have buy the tickets, i hope i can anjoy all the show,the show start from 3.30pm, but when i arrived rain is falling, so sadI decided to go back to the hotel"
Staying nearby we wandered through the gardens on a very hot and humid day.The kids enjoyed the sculptures and waterwaysWe did not look in the domes and the price was (in our opinion) prohibitive and the queues long.Unfortunately we could not access the sky walk as there was a Christmas show that made it inaccessible.
"The whole park is basically filled with plants and mostly man- made items. However, its a big park so its nice to go there for a long morning stroll. You also can stop by at Satay By The Bay where you can have satay, chicken wings and mostly other Singaporean food."
"I had one day to spare so decided to visit this top attraction in Singapore.Excellent attraction, beautifully landscaped and nice restaurants.A visit to the double conservatories is highly recommended, however, it can get quite cold if the weather is overcast so do bring a sweater or jacket to be comfortable.We wanted to go onto the OCBC Skyway but a Christmas Wonderland event surrounding the skyway meant that we had to pay for the entrance to the Christmas Wonderland event in addition to the skyway. We felt this was a rip off as we were not interested in the Christmas Wonderland event, so we decided to skip the skyway.Other than that, it was a nice experience."
"We wanted to visit the Gardens by the Bay at night in order to enjoy the illuminated Supertree Grove, and walk the OCBC skywalk.Unfortunately, the skywalk was closed due to the wet weather. However, we were told that we would not be permitted to enter anyway, as we had not purchased entry to the Christmas event that was being held around the trees after 3.00pm. Entry to this event could only be purchased online, and is a separate cost to the entry to the Garden and to the OCBC Skywalk. This seems to be a common theme in Singapore - there are add on costs for everything.The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are great and well worth the visit. But be warned that if you purchase tickets for the shuttle bus in the evening, you will not be given a ride back if you stay in the conservatories or gift shop until the 9.00 closing time. The last bus back to the entry is 8.45. The ticket sellers do not advise this - we were all left to walk back in the rain whilst we watched all the buses being driven back empty to park for the night. Very poor for a world class attraction."
Under expectation. Went there on weekdays after Christmas and was not so crowded but the activities is more for children and kids. You need to pay at every gantry. Food is over price. Not really friendly for elderly.
I was rather disappointed with this attraction and felt I had seen so much more beauty in other tropical forest environments that I have seen in Southeast Asia. The technical aspects of the domes were interesting and some plants in the flower dome were fascinating to see but for me not worth the time and money fighting one's way through the throngs of people visiting them.
"Definitely it does not deserve to be the No. 1 in Singapore Things To Do...I feel its little bit of a farce and a very well marketed activity. It mainly consists of Flower Dome, Cloud Forest, the Supertrees, other garden areas and OCBC Skyway. Out of these, the only place worth your while is the Flower Dome. Rest are all very average and very well marketed. The Flower Dome is where you will spend maximum time as you will go mad clicking pics. The Cloud Forest is useless. I was very keen to see the mist time @ Cloud Forest. Well, its just about ok, nothing great...and now comes the so called famous lighting show in the evening (7.40 pm and 8.40 pm)...it is really mediocre...I read so many reviews on TA about how good it is, but let me tell you it will quite useless and boring...about this place, if you don't believe me, ask the local Singapore people and they will tell you its a farce and overhyped place...also, the 2 domes actually look good from other parts of Singapore like from the Singapore Flyer...So, what does the above mean? Only if you are spending 4 days or more in Singapore, you go for Gardens By The Bay, else you can easily skip it...there are much better things to do in Singapore.How to reach - people who use public transportation, you can reach either through MRT or through bus. Through MRT you have to use Circle Line and reach Bayfront MRT and then walk down almost 400 meters. People who don't like walking too much, I would recommend the bus whereby reach Marina Gardens Drive and get down at the Main Gate of the gardens. It is a much shorter walk trust me.My observations/tips/info -1. The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are super cold (air conditioned). So, while it is silly to carry warm clothes only for these, but wearing something thick is a good idea.2. There is a McDonald's there.3. Charges - you can just go and roam around freely in the gardens, but my view is that since you make an effort to go there all the way, do then spend some money and see the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. The Flower Dome is worth the money.4. I booked online (package of Flower Dome + Cloud Forest) on klook.com and got a good discount. I recommend that.5. For OCBC Skyway you have to pay extra and funnily the ticket plaza for that is separate and not available at the main ticket counters. God only knows who came up with this smart xxx idea.6. I was very keen for OCBC Skyway but when I went underneath it to buy the tickets, I could see how useless it is, so thankfully I didnt go for it and spend extra. (so, on hindsight I thank the smart xxx who kept the ticket booth separate, that way I could see what is the OCBC Skyway and choose not to go for it!7. Mist times in the Cloud Forest are every 2 hours. Well its quite average, but if you have paid, then please experience it as it is the only little bit of wow factor there.8. Even if it rains which it was when we went, you are safe within the complex and within the domes. Only thing you will not be able to do is walk around in the gardens and do OCBC Skyway which anyway is useless9. There are decent amount of restaurants in the complex. Indians please note that this is an Indian restaurant (but we didn't eat there, so don't know how it is, so don't blame us later on)10. It will easily take 2-4 hours there.11. So, best time to reach is at 4 pm. First visit Flower Dome, and then by the time you reach Cloud Forest, you could experience the 6 pm mist time. And post that you have enough time to see other stuff. And at 7.45 you can see the over hyped lighting activity the Supertree Grove area12. Oh yes, I must mention that since we went during chirstmas, they were doing this Christmas Wonderland special activity for which, yes you are right, you have to pay extra. And I cant tell you every dollar used in that was a waste. Some really stupid live carol singing happening which will put you to sleep and then some sidey gaming options and then wait wait the biggest fraud - which is the artificial blizzard...oh my god, it was so useless. People who are not visiting during Christmas can ignore this. But please be wary of any activation they are doing there and asking for more money13. The gift shops are pretty nice but obviously exorbitantly priced (like all other Singapore gift shops @ tourist areas).So, this is a Singapore Tourism gimmick...yes, they have spent tonnes of monies to make it. Respect them for it. And the fact that you can visit it free, I respect the tourism board for that. But, what of your precious time??!!"
Didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. The flower dome is pretty average but the cloud walk was really great - a beautiful rainforest oasis. These gardens are beautifully maintained and the cloud walk has a good short film on global warming. The open gardens are also nice for a walk - great for families or couples alike.
nice but suggest that ticket price for NRIC holder can reduce to maybe each entrance ticket sell $10.
Slightly overrated here. Too busy and nothing truly outstanding. Singapore has more exciting stuff to offer.
"The gardens itself is free but to visit the 2 domes, we need to pay S$22.00 (I booked online through WTS Travel which was cheaper than normal price of S$28.00). As some reviewers had mentioned, the intention to create something unique was achieved, with a wide collection of flowers and trees existing in different parts of the world. But yes the addition of weirdly looking animal statues in parts of the domes plus the tacky looking Christmas tree were disappointments. There's also a lack of good, reasonably priced places to eat in close proximity to the Domes. There was the Satay by the Bay hawker center but it's not considered nearby especially if one would walk under the intense heat of Singapore's sun. I actually expected something better than what I had seen."
Went to see this masterpiece of horticulture combined with novel architecture and landscaping. Truely marvelous feat especially the cloud forest dome - giant artificial trees also very interesting. And everywhere beautiful flowers and greenery. BUT and it is a very big BUT - the asmosphere is 100% like an amusement park - piped music in loud speakes in the flower dome? How tacky can you make it. Carved wooden eagles and other animals suddenly protuding from an otherwise impeccably made flowerdisplay or brilliantly sculptured wall of greenery. Again the way this place as suddenly been turned into an entertainment venue is truely tasteless. And to top it off - some of the most horrific CHistmas displays including a cinderrella snow landscape in the middle of of the Baobab and catus displays.Go for the Botanical gardens if you have even an ounce of good taste - otherwise you will be sorely disappointed here.
"The signage is unclear & it is difficult to get around. Overall, the places are boring except those you have to pay. We didn't go up the skywalk coz you are forced to pay for the Christmas wonderland in Dec."
"This was a cool attraction and affordable by Singaporean standards. However, once I was there, while the trees were cool, there really wasn't much else going on there. We stayed for the Christmas light show, and the show was maybe 10 minutes long and very anti-climatic."
"Normally gorgeous during the year- especially durning the evening - elegant floodlit paths, nighttime blooming flowers, easy entrance to,the super grove.At Christmas, everything is blocked off, fences and police, ticket admissions out,of tickets, the elegant serene groves are jammed with people, amusement park machines, and you can't access any of the wonderful food places they have left inside the Great Christmas Barrier.Visit outside December,"
The walk from Marina Bay to the Gardens was delightful early in the morning and to be created by the Family of Sea Otters was a real treat . I always like the coldness of the two indoor biospheres but think $28 per person and no concession for over 65 's yet a big one if local was toppy for a maximum hours viewingWe were the 1st inside as up early so got around quickly but still there's not a great area to cover and I suppose you can read all the stuff on the countries eco strategies but it was all a bit dry and you come to marvel at the plants after all .So combine it with other stuff or get a deal as part of a package and it would be a good choice
The gardens are good and green. Interestingly they are quite empty and looks like not that famous among the locals. They prefer walking in malls.
"I'm not really a gardens kind of guy, but you have to visit a place which is number 1 on tripadvisor, right?So this is part of the effort to transform Marina Bay area into a tourist and entertainment hub. The place is basically a series of large, very well maintained gardens. Most of the gardens are free, but they aren't really that impressive. The key things to see here:1. Cloud Forest - Air conditioned massive glass house, that contains what is basically a magnificient effort of engineering - an artificial hill with hundreds of plant species distributed across different altitudes. Really made me marvel. It was a lot of fun to walk the high walkways. Best part of the park.2. Flower Dome - Basically a greenhouse filled with thousands of flowers. As someone from India (where flowers are everywhere) it wasn't too impressive.3. Supertree Groves - Solar cell embedded tree-like structures. There is a OCBC skyway (which lets you walk near the top) which was closed due to Christmas celebrations. THIS IS AN UNFAIR RIPOFF.Overall a good place to kill a couple of hours, the $20/28 tickets are quite reasonable to visit the cooled observatories. I wouldn't recommend it as the best place in Singapore but it's an OK evening visit."
"Don't get me wrong, the place is great and showcases the best indoor garden in the world and you would marvel how man can contain nature in such a small place. However it doesn't feel natural and its too commercialized that you need to pay every single amenities you go into. It is also crowded on normal tourist days."
"Like avatar? You'll enjoy gardens by the bay. Impressive, weird, alien. Natural, no. Personally I prefer the old school botanic gardens, but GBTB is impressive none the less."
Quite a variety of plants and flowers from round the world. Good to visit during special exhibitions. The covered domes are comfortable. The gardens outside are good for walks in the mornings and evenings . Singapore weather during the day can be very trying.
"Too many cars trying to get in - the queue was extremely long even though it was a Monday evening. Earlier at MBS, our 1 hour plus parking costs $14. Ouch. We gave up trying to drive into the Satay by the Bay as the queue was just too long."
Was there last saturday for christmas garden by the bay. Didnt notice that we have to purchase entrace fees $8 this year as it was free entrance in 2015.
"Whilst the architecture of the main plant buildings is impressive and the rain forest exhibition with artificial waterfall is amazing , once you have taken in those aspects it becomes quite boring. As with many places in Singapore the outdoor part of the exhibit becomes too humid to enjoy any lengthy walk through the metal trees area. mosquitoes in the evening are also an issue. Getting in and out by taxi can also prove tricky at times. Well worth a visit but it is one of those attractions that whilst it looks good from a distance it loses your interest quickly because now you have seen it."
We visited Gardens by the Bay as part of the Viator Pass package. Upon arriving at the attraction we found that only 1 of the 2 conservatories were open for viewing.We understood that this was due to essential maintenance. The one conservatory that we got to view was great. Facilities were clean. We got some lovely pictures.
We went late at night and most of the paid sections were closed. Lovely set-up and atmoshere but a bit of a walk in humid conditions. Not sure if its worth the no.1 status.
"As a gardener, I was a bit disappointed. The Cloud Dome was very interesting and focused on sustainability and the impacts of climate change. I was disappointed with the Flower Dome which I thought had very limited displays of flowers and the Skywalk I thought was a waste of money."
"Supertrees look nice, especially with the lighting at night; but nothing extraordinary.Best thing about cloud forest was the cool inside, which was much needed thing after walking in hot humid singapore weather! but it was more of a cloud garden than forest!!flower dome was a disappointment; overall I din't find it worth paying 28$ for these.."
Very plastic garden. Looks more like a movie set than a real garden. Could be a good venture out for kids but looked very artificial to me.
"Well this is a nice, colorful and futuristic park, the highlight being the 18 Supertrees which make you go wow for like 5 minutes and then it's okay. The park takes an average of about 2 hours if you want to see it completely so don't try to do it on the first day you arrive like me as it can be quite draining plus it can get quite hot and humid, making it a tiring experience It's a decent place, honestly nothing great just something touristy to check off the list, I would definitely skip it on my next visit."
"On previous visits to the Gardens by the Bay, we found it to be very peaceful, serene and beautiful, especially at night with the musical show on the super-trees. However, they have killed the ambience by putting up some garish ""Christmas"" props. Firstly, there was nothing resembling Christmas - no Santa, no reindeers, no pagent, no stunning Christmas trees, etc. Just large structures with very bright coloured lights that overshadow the giant trees. Then they had the food stalls which was a poor attempt to feature the Xmas markets. To make matters, they charged $6 for entry to the super-trees area which is normally free. Very disappointed that such a beautiful area which could have been magical like the Orchard Road Xmas decorations, was spoilt by cheap and tacky decor."
"The garden itself was too artificial to my taste, however, the view from here to the city skyline is quite good."
"Called into this attraction today, very disappointed as half was closed down for maintainence, what a shame as we heard it was so good. Loads of Koean bud loads of tourists that unfortunately push in front of you and spoil the nice quiet time one could have here. I would say you need to pick the right time for visiting these gardens as not to be outnumbered and pushed around by other travellers. We came here by the hop on hop off bus which was excellent service by the."
"Timing too short & staff not experience. Gloves need to buy & never let us know in advance to buy the gloves for playing snow. Snow is not snow but nice, my kids don't enjoy at all. Other than that still ok."
"My wife visited the gardens during the day, we had visited the year before. This time I was working, so she went in the flower dome on her own. It was $18 to get in, and it took about an hour to walk around.The Christmas display was good, but expensive for what you got.There was a winter wonderland attracting advertise for the evenings, we went along expecting to be able to pay to get in, only $4, although the cost increases the closer to Christmas. It looked really good and could hear the music playing.Unfortunately you cannot turn up and pay, you need to book on line and print off the tickets, therefore you will need access to a printer.There were a lot of disappoint people being turned away, so not just us who misunderstood.I did try to purchase online, but ended up setting up a Visa Pay account which is similar to PayPal, I thought I was selecting pay by visa. Once you have created an account you can pay and print your tickets.I did mange to create an account, and add a card, but after checkout I kept getting an error, and in the end gave up and decided not to bother. I am now getting daily spam to my email from visa pay, about other attractions."
The place has been hijacked by winter wonderland.Large temporary screens have been erected to prevent any sight unless you pay.
It's ok to visit once in a while I guess it's pretty but that's it. I'm more concerned about how hot it gets it's just not comfortable to go around. But since it really is humid in Singapore this can be expected already.
"I visited the Gardens three years ago shortly after they opened. They were an oasis from the city with spectacular 'trees'The Trees have matured well, and two large conservatories have been built. However there is now a large and busy area for tourist buses and a path from there to the conservatories that had irritating Christmas music playingIt is hard to escape the restaurants and car parks to find some tranquillity among the plants. A great shame."
"We bought the night tour for the gardens by the bay package and my kids enjoyed it, but it is best with a tour guide."
A pleasant way to spend an evening. There is no need to pay for the light show as the observation areas at the side are free
"Been there for work purposes as well as family outing (with complimentary tickets). Personally, it's a waste of time. The only thing i'm looking forward to is the cool air (which the guide claims it's not coming from the aircon but from the plants). After all, this dreaded venue is quite a distance from the MRT station/bus stop. In the midst of this sweltering heat getting in that cool dome is indeed a relief.The plant species are nothing to be excited about, have seen them during my travels, nothing exotic. Perhaps something should be done to make the exhibit more exciting (i.e. interaction booth, themed plants, etc.)"
"When we visited the Gardens, it's hard to truly enjoy them because there are so many people that everyone just shuffles along in a line and you either keep up or get walked over. It's very impressive in its scale but the gift shops are very expensive and all seem to offer the same products."
"We loved the gardens, it's flora and views over the city. It was wonderful to see great architecture and lots of variety of plants. Almost everything lived up to our expectations and more, apart from some things that I would like to mention. And for those reasons I decided to give it 3 stars:- ticketing system is a nightmare and not very straight forward like in Kew Gardens in London for example. When you come to the main gate, you cannot buy tickets to all attractions there. You have to walk to most places you want to see and queue up all over again. So if you come at the busy time like we did, you will feel like spending time in the queues! Also, even when you think you can buy a ticket to a Skywalk for example, you will later realise at the counter that it's a mandatory to have a ticket to Christmas wonderland and guess what?))) you cannot buy ticket for this attraction at the same counter! It's a very disorganised system. We had to queue up again to get a ticket to Wonderland and then queue up again to get a ticket to Sky walk to then queue up to get to a sky walk! So stupid!- They promise you a free souvenir with tourist pass but guess what?;)) none of the counters we bought a ticket from had it! Why can't they deliver their promises and give you a souvenir at the main gate ticketing place!?- after we paid additional fee to enter Wonderland, we were forced to pay more for attractions inside the fair! I mean common guys! It's unacceptable to treat visitors like that.- Flower dome is nothing special at all and isn't worth the money they ask you to pay for it!My suggestion to administration would be:- Sell tickets to all attractions in all ticketing counters!- Have stored free promised souvenirs at all ticketing counters- Display clearly what's included and not included in a ticket price and what would be additional fees on the territory of attraction- Include flower dome in the same ticket for Cloud forest and don't charge extra for it.- Offer free shuttle to the domes for old people, family with small children, people with disabilities and pregnant women. It's absurd to ask them to pay."
"They are probably worth a visit to escape from the city, however they are not that extensive, nor are they that interesting or outstandingly attractive. If you are pushed for time there are more interesting places to visit and sights to see. You would not come to Singapore especially to see this attraction. We did not go into the attractions you have to pay for."
It is a nice place for relaxation and also for one to just soak into the soothing atmosphere to let one's stress goes away
"The trees are impressive, but the whole thing place appears geared to getting you to buy additional items or experiences. But I guess everyone needs to make a profit. I enjoyed my walk through the areas, but was happy to get back on the MRT and back to the hustle and bustle."
"If you ever say you're going to Singapore nearly everyone will tell you to visit the Garden by the Bay.It's a beautiful walk through a luscious gardens and waterfront views, so you can take some really gorgeous photos. There are some areas where you need to pay to go in but you can just walk around the outer gardens free entry.If you have time, drop by for a visit but not an essential for Singapore in my opinion."
The gardens are pretty but I was not wowed. I did not get to see the baby statue. In my opinion the domes are a waste of time. Not really sure why they created such expansive domes and didn't use the space well.
The planting in the flower dome is particularly impressive with a wealth of variety and the architecture of the glass houses and the 'trees' is quite awe inspiring. Unfortunately I came away with the overall impression that it was too manufactured - not a bad place by any stretch of the imagination but I prefer the more natural surroundings of the botanic gardens.
Had heard good things but not impressed. Would have preferred to visit the zoo. found there wasn't lots to see
Gardens by the Bay has amazing horticulture. Flowers and trees that span the world. The best part of the trip is the Cloud Dome and the Pods. Simply AMAZING. It was very hot walking.
"Expansive and green on the literal and technological sense. The super trees have solar cells to harvest energy to power the needs of the two conservatories and the rest of the gardens. It was too hot out to comfortably explore the differently themes gardens and I barely scratched the surface with my morning visit. The OCBC Skyway, which is a short pathway high up between super trees at the Supertrer Grove was also nice. It was a bit cooler and breezier than at ground level and also provided some good vistas surrounding the city.I say the garden is young because the plant growth on the super trees haven't reached the top support of the structures. It would be interesting to make another visit in 10 years to see any differences."
"A pretty ordinary place, nothing special and the light show in the evening was not worth the wait, in fact we left before it finished. For what it is we found it to be very over priced, there are far better things to do in Singapore than this place, I would give it a miss."
"Beautiful place to visit if you have time. However if you have been to many gardens before, then visit this place only at night for the view. Though they have excellent merchandises."
"OK I wouldn't say it was bad, but just not my cup of tea, I walked through the entire place in 20 minutes while many spend hours and hours."
"Despite the size of the country, Singapore does really know how to make something. The 2 domes are collection of flowers and plants. The flower dome consists of flowers and plants from everywhere while the cloud forest focus on high above plants with its waterfall. There is also a nice video of what will happened to the world if there's a 5 degree increase in the world temperature."
"We enjoyed the evening light show but unless you want to spend additional funds to go inside the conservatories, the outside gardens aren't overly exciting."
If you really appreciate a beautiful garden you'll love it. It is very expensive but i suppose it would cost a lot of money for the up-keep. A lot of effort has gone into the planning of the gardens but I still prefer the Botanical Gardens in Singapore and its free.
"What makes Garden by the Bay amazing is that, the colossal place was done by human hands in so short of time. I figure it is mostly done by immigrants.Place is well designed with their selection of plants and the framework where it is latched on.The lightshow in the evening is enjoyed by many tourist."
"It's surely a ""most see"" spot of Singapore but looks fake from my point of view.I spent 3 weeks in Singapore and most enjoyed the Muslim and Indian neighborhoods, more authentic than the gardens by the bay."
"It was a very good place ,, we really enjoyed it, but unfortunately the children garden at that time was closed."
"Some nice gardens and worth a walk but nothing special. Hard to recommend anything but there is a cheap food court. The only decent thing was the rainforest dome, which is worth the trip alone."
"It's a beautiful place, I enjoyed the stroll and appreciated the effort of its landsape architecture but I wasn't enchanted by its beauty because it's too well crafted! it's a bit hard to enjoy nature like that.I think its one of those places that you'll enjoy the scenry then, but you'll forget it aftewards. But it's a great place for family with kids."
Quite romantic place to go but the evening show was not very well received as the narration was so muffled and & unclear
"We visited this attraction at night which turned out better since it is cooler though the inside of the two domes were cool but the path going to the mtr station is better with the lights and slightly cooler breeze at night. And we were able to see the light show at the OCBC on our way back to the station. Nice, refreshing. Great for pictures"
Specially beautiful light show in the night when trees show their colors. Day time not so impressive especially for kids.
"Don't go on a sunny and humid day. The cloud Forest is probably the best lot of all of them. Plenty of photo opps if you are interested in that. Apart from that there is not much to see, compare to other places. So if you have some spare time in the evening then worth visiting."
Interesting concept and te light show is good but it didn't blow me away! It is very man made as with everything in signapore. It is built on reclaimed land from the sea so it is fairly flat... Maybe visit if you like interesting gardens.
"The information of the plants is not enough. And also the exhibitions are more then less. But the environment is nice overall. I believe kids enjoy so much, but i would love go sth place is more natural but not artificial."
"Visited with my wife and friends. Will improve over time when the gardens mature, but still worth a visit. We just walked around and payed to go up onto the Skywalk ($8SGD per person), which was good."
"For myself and my younger brother(teen) . It is honestly very boring . We are Singapore residents and have been here for years. Thinking to visit the gardens out of blue. Nice place to take picture , nothing more . However if you are interested in orchids and plants from the world then it's worth going ."
"Light show just right, place nice to relax. More attractions for kids needed. Nice to go there during the afternoon"
"Came along early evening to see the light show, with the city and Marina sands hotel in the background . Worth paying the $8 for the tree top walk, but an exercise to time it perfectly to coincide with the 7.45 or 8.45 shows. However best view of the display is from ground level."
What I like about this place is that they have cars that take you around the garden. I traveled with my mom and a little baby so it was helpful for us.
"The gardens are immaculate and very interesting. The staff were very helpful. The light and sound show was, um, ok. Maybe it would have been better if we had been farther away instead of underneath the trees. The cloud dome was very well done and something a bit different."
Have seen many pics of this place and was really looking forward to walking around but once there felt a little disappointed - not as beautiful as I expected.
"Visited this with my Singaporean friend. While I am impressed with the architecture from outside - it is visually stunning and looks impressive with the backdrop of Marina Bay and the central business area - unfortunately for me it doesnt live up to the hype.It is a place to go to get away from the humidity, take some selfies (which is all everyone there seems to want to do) and see some nice views across Singapore.The cost of the ticket is not high so perhaps for that alone it is worth going to. But for the gardens and any real educational value, it falls pretty short."
Always lot of people. Nice place to have a walk but nothing awesome. Should definitely see the light show at night.
"Went there with my wife on our first visit.Discount is given to those above 60 years old.Visited the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest Dome.As for the Flower Dome, one gets to see different species of flowers from all over the globe, quite interesting !!!As for the Cloud Forest, they did a good job of constructing a seven storey structure in the middle of the Dome.You can either walk up the stairs besides the structure or take an elevator all the way to the top.Like the overall design of the place !!!"
"We went to both of the Gardens but I was a bit disappointed. The architecture of the buildings was beautiful and well designed, but I expected more of the contents of the Gardens for the price we had paid. The flowers were not that special. At night the lights outside are beautiful. If you just come for the sight, just wait for the night."
Nice gardens and many interesting plants however I did not get the WOW FACTORI think you must be an enthusiast about plants to get the wow experience or if you from the tropics it might be more interesting for you as the have many plants from the cooler climate ! It s ok to visit once if you have spare time but their are many better attraction in Singapore
nice and interesting but now necessarily wow...take the skywalk and ensure you go when its not too hot and also at night
In Singapore and if you like to keep busy then I would definitely go here. It's good to walk around for 2-3 hours and it's very well done.
"It's just ok. A bit over priced $50 usd for both cloud and flower Forrest. The cloud Forrest is by far the best. Has a walk way up in the sky that is worth the value. The flower garden is nice and ok. Spectacular if you are into that but for me, just a long walk after a hefty meal, so great workout in an climate control dome full of flowers. The tree grove is the tall multi led trees you see in the pictures. It's nice but nothing worth repeating. Over all. If you are In Singapore and have nothing else to do, it could be an option. I switched from going to the zoo and regret myself 1000%. At the end, I just remember the super long walks and the superb skywalk in the cloud Forrest."
"The Cloud Forest and SuperTrees/Skywalk were great.Unfortunately we didn't get to see the Flower Dome, due to a ticketing mix up. We were initially told we could use the ticket to enter the Cloud Forest and could come back the next day for the Flower Dome. When we came back, we were then told we had to use the ticket to both conservatories on the same day and that our ticket was no longer valid. The staff at the Visitor Services desk were surprisingly rude and unhelpful when we sought clarification.Make sure you allow enough time to do both on the same day."
"The feeling of man made environment is far too overwhelming. From the minute you enter to the moment of making an exit, there is a lack of sense of being with nature but feeling like a display of plants - that's all."
"Easily accessible from the Bayfront MRT station and part of the Marina Bay Sands complex, the outdoor gardens are free to visitors. They feature tropical flora from different parts of the world, and are interesting enough. The Supertree grove part of the outdoor gardens which has large artificial towers with plants wrapped around is an interesting concept though we thought them to be somewhat pointless. There is a skyway (SGD 8 fee) connecting the supertrees but it was closed when we were there.The highlight was the indoor conservatory Flower Dome, which features trees and flowers from various parts of the world, very nicely organized and very informative, and thankfully very air conditioned. The second conservatory Cloud Forest was a little gimmicky with a recreation of a mountain forest environment complete with faux waterfall. Had great views of the Sands from inside the dome though. The conservatory tickets are SGD 28 for the two domes.The gardens store deserves special mention for some unique (if overpriced souvenirs) including potted plants of different shapes and sizes.Overall, recommended for a one time visit for a tourist, especially if you have an interest in horticulture."
We booked this hotel just to experience the infinity pool. We were unlucky probably because there were lots of people at the pool that time. We have to wait until the sun goes down yet the pool still a bit crowded even at night. We have to wake up early to avoid the crowd at the infinity pool. The price is too high without free breakfast. Checkin is 3pm and check out is at 11am for an expensive stay that we weren't able to enjoy.
We visited Gardens by the bay in the evening . Honestly speaking it is an average kind of palce . the laser show in the evening was average . The cost to visit the cloud forest and flower dome is not too high and this should not be top of your list place in Singapore . If you have extra time then no harm visiting it
"Spent an agreeable, but not remarkable, couple of hours pootling around the Gardens by the Bay. Frankly, it gets better the further away you are are.The gardens themselves have lots of separate areas featuring different types of plants, but there is always too much concrete or tarmac in evidence, it all feels too man-made. Spend the same amount of time in the Botantical Gardens and you'll immediately see what I mean.The highlights are the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest exhibitions for which there is an entrance fee. The Supertree Grove and skywalk is OK too, best at night when it lights up. If you're there in the evening, hang around for the 7.45pm or 8.45pm music and light show but don't make a special trip or cry if you miss it.All worth doing on your visit to Singapore but not as good as it's cracked up to be - Botanical Gardens is much better."
"Gardens by the Bay is an ingenious way of absorbing the wonders of nature .... especially for those who love flowers, trees and plants.It is facinating and enriching in knowing nature at its best.Only bug is that the domes are cooling while the outdoor part is hot..... so definitely a hot and cold experience.Signs in the outdoor area can improve as some parts we go merry go round."
"As a student of agriculture and horticulture and long time garden lover I had to visit this place once. It probably needs a few more years to grow into its surrounds and infrastructure however the creators have done a good job.What I didn't like about it was the lining up for tickets, shuffling through the glass houses with thousands of others and waiting your turn to take photos of significant features.Kids love it and there is a good food court in the precinct."
"This may not be for all liking. Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful and it's not your usual garden, but I think I expected too much. 1-2 hours is enough to see the whole garden, unless you really want to inspect the flowers/ plants one-by-one. I enjoyed seeing the succulents rather than those ornamental flowers...Will I come back? Sure, why not..."
"Went there for the third time, still beautiful, especially at night. Well groomed gardens, breathtaking plants and waterfall."
"Went with a friend in the evening around 8 PM to stroll around.Lot of Trees and greenery, but some of the big trees are artificially built.In the evening around 8.45 PM there is a musical show which happens around the Big tree. It is for 15 mins.There is music and the trees have lights which try to sync as per the music.I have seen better shows than this, this one is quite average.You have to pay additional fees to go on the artificial trees, but I dont think it is worth it."
It's ok but nothing special- you can walk for free in gardens but domes cost! I guess you have to do it but go in with low expectations!
"This was our second visit to GBTB, on this occasion they had an offer on for children to recieved a free maracca if the visited during children's week - which ran from 1-8 October, but they had already exhausted stock ok the 3rd when we visited, bit unfortunate.It's still a great attraction, but I do think it was overpriced for what it was, especially with 3 kids aged 5, 7 and 9 - would be great to see some ""family"" pricing which might offer better value than separate ticketing.Cloud dome is amazing, but if you're fearful of heights it may be an issue for you."
its all very manufactured and garish and there are charges to get in to each dome. The best bit was the view of the Marina
The architecture of the glass domes and waterfall are impressive but the actual botanical aspect of the gardens was not very interesting. I did not see many rare or unusual species although I am no botanist. It was a nice half day trip.
"Everything just works, easy access and flow from attraction to attraction. Lots of walking so wear flat shoes. We walked to satay by the bay from lunch which was perfect for those wanting a cultural experience"
It's a big place but it don't come with helping staffers or Many sign boards. But yes for kids till 10 it has complementary water park and play area. If you are into gardening you will like it else it's waste of time. Light show is OK but not worth giving a day
"From Marina Baysands, you can cross the street or just find the lift to get to the gardens. There are many sections there and you have to walk from place to place. I experienced 3 things: super trees, flowers dome and cloud forest. The ticket price for flowers dome and cloud forest is S$28. For super trees, it's S$8 if you wanna be on sky walk. After these 3 things, I walked along the riverside, head back to Marina Baysands to find the MRT."
"Went to the cloud forest. Very pretty indoors, but it is not comparison if you've ever been to a rain forest. They've done a nice job of re-creating a rain forest, but it feels a bit artificial."
Mid-Autumn festival fun place to be with your family. Lots of activates to participate lots of different lanterns display to see.
"It is cool, but i think it looks better from the distance among the tall buildings. I think if you go with kids it may be better, but even at night i didn't think much walking through it. It is very crowded at night.If you have trouble walking or need a wheel chair it could be a pain. If you do bring kids, keep a close watch on them at night and day, as there are a lot of people, corners and nooks they can be hiding in or around."
"If you love plants, trees, flowers 1and gardens (of course), then this is a place for you.It's nice and the supertrees are magnificent, but not something I would love to visit again. Unless, I will have new guests from overseas, then this would definitely be an additional bullet to their itineraries.Both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are indoors so you don't have to worry of sudden changes in weather, comfy to walk inside. Be wary of the peak season though as queuing up to the Cloud Forest is quite frustrating. Be sure to empty your bladder before going up so you won't be going down for the toilet and queue again going up. Pack a lot of patience as well during peak season in Forest Dome as you may not be able ""to stop and smell the flowers"" as 2 to 3 level of people will be lining up to take photos of every single plant :)"
"We went in the daytime ( Grand Prix in the evening ) and although we were fairly impressed , we did not quite feel that it lived up to the rave reviews, but that said I have little doubt that at night time with the light show it is fairly spectacular . We did not have children with us but there is a great play area for youngsters with water sprays which are ideal for cooling off when the sun it is at its hottest . As others have noted , the gardens themselves are free and you only have to pay for the two enclosed areas and the canopy walk , the latter of which offers very good views ."
"I went there during the day. I had fun walking around snapping pictures....giant trees...giant fish aquarium...kids zone was loads of fun even for me as an adult....cactus island...metal sculptures everywhere celebrating SG birthday! Well manicured grounds, mosquito free zone! No need for a tour guide, signs are everywhere to discover own your own. Clean restroom accessible."
It worth a tour just to see the big trees and to take a rest from the fashion shop malls of the Marina Bay Sands
We visited the place on a weekend in Aug 2016. We enjoyed the sights but they really did not exceed our expectations (maybe we expected too much).The place was teeming with people and it was a nightmare when we tried to go back to our hotel. The queue at the taxi rank was quite long.I recommend to visit the place during weekdays/weeknights. The cab driver told me that it's much quieter during those times.
APlace to visit if you like cool place and Flowers. There are two domes the first one is the flowers experience and the next one is a Mountain Forest Experience. The ticket boith is like 10-15 minutes walk to the 2 Cooled Conservatories. You pay 28SGD per person for the two coservatories and 3SGD each for the Shuttle. I love the Flower conservatory because it showcase flowers that are blooming and great collection as well. The cactus area is also nice. But the second Conservatory was not quite as spectacular as compared to a real mountain. Although I am impressed with the arts place around it. A nice place to visit for nature and flower lovers.
"Found a lot of flowers is not fresh and withered. Cannot found tulip flowers which is my favorite, but definitely will back again when tulip is there."
"Not quite the gardens we expected, but a nice sight at night and a must-see whilst in Singapore. The fact that the gardens are free is a boss, and they are clearly popular with tourists and locals alike.Our only disappointment was that it was mostly an artificial attraction, although maybe more of the flora would be visible during the day.The skywalk was worth the price and wait, and especially if you can manage it during the lightshow it gives a great view."
"Wasn't sure on going here as when ever in Singapore when you are around a lot of greenery the humidity tends to go up and it did.There's a lot to see if you enjoy flowers and plants, it's all kept very clean too.We went up into the trees and you get great views of Singapore and MBS."
"It's a green garden at singapore,, and include a big gardens in the worlds,, there a many building when like a tower with a grass,, and bridge at the top where connected tower to tower,,,"
"If this is your first flower garden visit, you would be most impressed. First off, I thought the domes were huge that you need to take a buggy to see all. But both domes (cloud forest and flower dome) will take around 30-45 minutes on foot.Both domes are air conditioned, a great relief after walking around Singapore's humid and hot weather. We first visited the cloud forest which has a water falls. They created a walk through on the cloud forest so that you can go up and see the falls from the top. I think whats amazing is that this entire mountain thing including the falls is man made, which was really tricky to the eye at first. From the walk way to the clouds you can have a good view of the super trees. They also created art from branches. Funny as it may seem, I felt a bit mislead by the word ""cloud dome"" because i thought i would be seeing clouds or walking past clouds while going up the mountains.The flower dome was well maintained. They are landscaped as if they are in nature. Most of the flowers were orchids of various colours. I was hoping to see more kinds to be honest. If you are planning to go to the botanical gardens, my suggestion is to get to the domes first before heading to the botanical gardens.I was very impressed by the crystals. All in all was a good experience but i have seen better.Would recommend it to visitors."
"I haven't been so much of a floral world fan myself that my first intention of coming here is merely to accompany my parents and take few photos at the place everybody says is a ""Singapore must go"". I enjoyed myself a lot for the fact that albeit the sun, the air-con is blowing that I did not worry of sweat. Alas, I wore too little clothing that it was too cold for me. The flowers were alright because in Indonesia we've had a lot of flowers as well. But indeed if you are a fan of flowers, you should visit this place. Don't forget to take a picture at the falls!"
"Visiting the Flower Dome is a worthwhile and pleasant experience (I am certainly not a botanist, I should add). Remember to bring a sweater, as the temperature is quite low inside.I did not get the point of the Cloud Forest, however. Was it about showcasing the peculiar architecture or about exhibiting bits and pieces of assorted natural environment? None of the two goals was achieved in a satisfactory way, in my opinion.In any case, you will have no choice but to pay the (steep) admission price for both the attractions."
"Worth a visit, very beautiful and easy to get around. The sound and lights show at night was interesting to see. Very busy."
"Connected to Marina Bay Sand Hotel, we were spending an hour here walking around in one afternoon. We did see the flower dome but skip the cloud forest. There are entrance fees at both places. If you are into botanical garden and winter flower, go for it. Otherwise I didn't think it was worth paying high ticket price for it."
"We had already been to the botanic gardens and by comparison this doesn't seem to offer that much. We didn't go in the domes, which maybe would have held our attention more, but these have an entrance fee. We did pay to do the Skywalk and we all enjoyed this. The cafes tend to be very busy - they offer much needed air conditioning and drinks. Because of its central location its worth visiting to wander round but in our opinion it not a ""must see""."
It is a garden after all. How amazing can it be? Its certainly original and the light show in the evening is recommended so time your visit. The restaurant is a but over priced. But overall a very cool place to visit.
The whole place was very artificiary and man made. I wont pay for the entry tickets again to be in the air conditioned room to see the flowers and plants for tourists. My children only enjoy the water play area which was free admission. Not worth to spend on entry tickets with young children!
"Got off a Hippo bus and then struggled to find our way: signposting is diabolical.However, we used the little electric shuttle to get to the domes. Don't be caught out with charges: visitors pay more than locals and it is the local prices which are displayed.We chose to do only one dome: the flower dome.This was fantastic: the displays were brilliant in all meanings of the word with displays of gardens from all over the world: did seem odd to take a 9 hour flight to see an Australian garden but whatever! There was a special orchid display; absolutely stunning.Also note the temperature; we thought the dome would be hot and humid but it was a very pleasant temperature and cooler than outside!The Pollen cafÃ© is expensive and the service not as good as you normally get in Singapore.Overall good and worth a visit."
Watched the light show which is quite decent. Quite a lot of tourist but you won't feel packed when walking around. Worth paying a visit if you have too much spare time.I took a taxi to get there and walked to marina bay sands to get to the mrt. You can walk to the other side of the river and get to the Merlion as well.
"Take a leisurely stroll thru this tranquil pretty garden. Don't forget to take your camera, well worth the visit and make some beautiful memories. Takes about half a day to get around the garden."
We visited the garden at night...spent 1 hr in the gardenNice music and lights show...Well organised and clean garden.
"Visited briefly but unfortunately it was raining so could not enjoy fully .Lovely flowers, well set out."
"Visit during the middle of the season to ensure that plants/flowers are in full bloom. We went a month after the opening of cherry blossom season and we were disappointed as most of the flowers were already wilted. Then, we went back with our family during the tulip season and it was better.Both the conservatories are huge and so is the crowd (we visited once in the morning, then afternoon). Be prepared to have a lot of other faces in the photos. :)I like the Cloud Forest better than the Flower Dome. Less crowd and view is nicer."
"For the expense and the trouble to get there, I'm not sure this is worth the time. Singapore seems to be a constant upset, and GBTB is no exception. It's 3 for the tram, and then the Cloud Forest and the Hall of Flowers are extra.The pathways are so narrow in the former that I saw more baby carriages than I did forest. The only persons not taking photos of leaves and flowers were those babies. I have to admit the orchid exhibit in the Flowers Hall was spectacular, but that was the highlight. I have seen many more luxurious gardens. Next time, that big ferris wheel."
I read a lot of good reviews about this place and light show accompanied by classic music. We've been there before 51 anniversary of Singapore. Music was trimmed for patriotic purposes. Probably that's something which did not fit into our mood.
"It was alright. I was pretty psyched about the Garden Rhapsody, it was pretty disappointing. This would be a place to visit if you have absolutely nothing to do."
"I loved the flower dome because the flowers were so colorful and the landscaping was incredible. I enjoyed the scenery of different plants from all over the world. The cloud forest observatory is also worth a visit for its waterfall unique rainforest flora but not if you're afraid of heights. However, I skipped on the supertree grove because the price was not worth it."
The two conservatories are worth visiting.Flower Dome and Cloud Forest is nice.Takes 2 hours to visit both.If you are short on time just do that and rest you leave...
"Though does not worth the money spent, but good and different kind of place to visit. Water falls is good."
We had a good time seeing flowers and green plants but unfortunately not that much of flowers and trees and gardens that's all but a good place to visit
"Very nice and neatly done up! Well Done! My family had so much fun here, its really awesome and wonderful!"
"Visited Sunday early evening which is probably the most popular time! Great displays, family friendly. However the mid town Botanical Gardens are the real deal if you have time to visit. Nice to combine with stroll or shopping or dining around Marina Bay Area."
"There is a lot of plants, tree just like a forest. The bome is very beautiful and we climb up the bome and walk along bridge very excited. This is a good experience but unlucky we forget to bring swim coat, so that we can't play the kid zone which look like wonderful water zone. I hope there will be more interesting zone built this park in the future."
Worth a visit. Although I prefer more natural gardens. The light show was good. Takes some walking between the Marina bay light show and the light show at Gardens by the Bay 15 minutes or so. The light show are the Gardens is superior if your having to choose between the two.
"We paid SGD33 each inclusive of flower dome and cloud forest entrance. Its an air-conditioned indoor activity so it was fun. If you love flowers, then go and visit the place. It was right in the middle of the city. The structure was overwhelming, good job Singapore."
Nice gardens but not exceptionally out of the world!Tickets seem to be a little overpriced and they charge you extra for a one time to and fro shuttle to the gardens.
This is a nice walk but a lot of the place you need to by tickets to get in.The Botanic Gardens are much better and bigger.A pleasant experience if you have time.
"modern and stylish ""city"" garden, shows what man can build and reach, gives a good impression of rain forest, educative, missing more places to take a rest in the domes, surounding areas should be more like a natural garden."
"In general, I would say the whole experience of being at the gardens was just average. Paid to go in the flower dome and cloud forest. They are currently having the orchid exhibition at the flower dome. Nice orchids but too limited in quantity in my opinion and it's mostly all concentrated in the middle of the dome on a one way traffic lane. Difficult to take pictures as you will be blocking the traffic flow. Everything has to be done quick. The other side of the flower dome is like a desert with just cactus exhibition. Cloud forest was basically just a mini forest with a giant waterfall at the entrance. There were a few fossils and glaciers monuments to look at the the ground level and also video clips on natural disasters I think. Too many people were packed at the video section so we decided to skip.The positive side to these two domes is that they are both well air-conditioned and it was very nice to be inside. Nice change to the heat and humidity at the free zone outside. And you get to go in and out the domes as many times you want (within the day of ticket purchase). Just need to get a stamp on your wrist.There is a little cafe/restaurant inside the flower dome. Did not get a chance to look at the menu and environment as they were having a private event when we were there.Overall just an average experience. Will go to the flower dome again in the future only if there's a specialty exhibition (I.e. Tulips exhibition or during festive season when the domes are decorated). Other than that, I would give the domes a pass."
Was there during the Singapore Garden Festival. Lots of people and places to eat were limited.The Flower Dome was nice but crowded. Guess it would be more peaceful and less stressful during weekdays.The Cloud Forest was nice as well. The only thing that was really irritating was that we had to wait a long time for the elevator.
"Not as exciting as the light shows in Dubai , Sdyney n the rest of the world as its on the man made trees rather than water ! A different experience and a must is a visit to the roof top bar and casino at Marina Bays"
"We went there around 6pm and it still broad daylight. The place was full, really crowded and long queues but we waited patiently. The entrance of going up there is around $4 or $10 I think? But yeah, almost waited in line for like 45mins.We went up and I was quite scared because I thought the bridge is just steady but as I walked it was shaking and I realized the grips that were holding the bridge are a metal rope? (idk the term, sorry). Not guaranted for safety lol. I started to sweat a bit because I was nervous, I'm afraid of heights. Although the good thing is that it was not windy so thank goodness but still, I walked a bit slow but I was with my siblings and dad. Good thing, mom didn't bother to go up because we knew she would be scared [lol]. The view was so amazing, took a photo in a seconds then boom, started walking again without staring down. And only 15-mins is allowed to spend after that, you need to go down.After our thrilling moments, we went down now and great timing, the light show started. It was really cool! Btw, every year there's always a new theme so it's not like boring if ever you're going to visit here again or for first timers. :)"
"Overall very impressive to be sure - beautiful garden settings, orchids in all different colors but it was a wet, rainy day when we visited, busloads of visitors, so it wasn't an enjoyable experience."
"GBB is a great place to visit but holding the garden festival there was too spread out so did not get an international feel and too hot to stand and admire the gdns. The buggies that we pay for are split into different areas and meant we had to pay again to go elsewhere or as i found, walked all the way back to the entrance as the buggy i paid for did not stop where i eventually ended up after seeing the fanasy gdns. ( thankfully that was in air con so i could spend time admiring the displays.at aged 62 i needed the buggy! ) staff excellent. Had to pay to see flower dome, which i have seen twice anyway and did mot want to go in, in order to see the free gdn exhibits., the pricing on the net was not clear. Will happily visit GBB again but not the garden festival there."
"Gardens by the Bay is worth a visit, but not more than that. There's a bunch of plants and trees brought in from several parts of the world, there's a tall tower kid of thing that you can climb and that's about it. There's a children's play area which is actually a lot of fun. The tickets are not cheap."
The gardens are beautiful and one of the best places to click pictures. Try to visit towards the evening so that you can enjoy the best o both sunlight and the lighting that they have put up.
It is very beautiful from outside especially at night! It is like 3-4 large shining flowers. From the inside I found it to be just okay. But would surely recommend this place if you are not short of time.
a big place to view n for those who like photography it's a good place to do photography at night cause the lights is colourful
Is a nice experience if you got time in Singapore.Will not be the must do unless you love plants. But overall was pleasant.
"The place is nice, but my expectation is quite high about this place.and turn out to be disappointing.maybe because i came when its raining and the crowd is pretty crazy.the show is great though..but its way too dark and we barely see anything.overall its nice place to go with your friends, family or loved one.but make sure you check the weather and avoid weekend..because the crowd is massive.."
"We went here during daytime to see what this garden was all about. It's really easy to get here by MRT, as the station is right under the garden (Bayfront station).The coolest thing in the carden is definitely the super trees and the area around them. We didn't do the skywalk though, as we thought 8 SGD per person wasn't wort the 50 meters. The Cloud Forest is also nice, but not so special that it deserves to be the number one thing to do in this city. Yes, it is a nice little waterfall and a nice skywalk, but the hole thing is over within 10 minutes tops!The Flower Dome is not so special in my opinion. Much prettier flowers in the botanical gardens!To enter both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest we payed 20 SGD each (adult).NB! When we planned our trip we thught a visit to Gardens by the Bay would take several hours. We did the whole thing within 2 hours. But you can of course spend the wholde day here if you want. There are a few cafes and restaurants at the site, and also chairs and benches. However, Singapore has much more interesting and fun things to offer besides this garden area."
It was BEAUTIFUL & worth the effort to see it...many BEAUTIFUL plants. Night time is also GOOD. Many lights to highlight the Garden. A MUST see in Singapore...
It is good but it is too big and it takes lots of walking so u have to use the mini trains in it. The place has areas to rest and have a meal or s drink. The staff is friendly.
There are 2 attractions you would have to go if you visit Garden by the Bay. The first one would be the Flower Dome in which you will get to see different exhibits of flowers. So you would need to check on the calendar of events so that you would not miss your favourite exhibits.Another place to go is Cloud Forest. Cloud Forest is a place where you can have the feeling that you are in a mountain. You will get to experience the Tree Top Walk where you would have the feeling that you are 2000m above the sea level.You can visit the Gift Shop after you had finished the above 2 attractions.
Scenic beauty especially at night. There were 2 free shows; one at 19.45 and one at 20.45. Shows last 15 minutes. Nice sound and light-effects although the music is slightly patriotic (my son even called it propaganda).
"Gardens by the bay is a nice lush park. I walked around one evening and enjoyed the light show. It was worth the visit (free), but by no means amazing."
"Good place to relax.There are 2 dome attractions - Cloud dome and flower dome. Good only if you have interest in plants and flowers.Everyday night before park closes, the light show on artificial trees is good."
"Nothing special in any way. I've seen a few public gardens in my time and this was average compared to others.One attraction this one does has however, is the bridge you can cross to get an amazing view. This will set you back $8 Singapore dollars.The garden is much better at night with the lights and beautiful scenery these cause."
"Gardens by the Bay, basically, is a Must-Go for all tourists. This is where you can see a park with different varieties of trees and plants and flowers. In addition, if you are looking for a place (quiet and quiet) to spend the day, Gardens by the Bay will be the right choice. However, 1 formal advice and that will be: go in the night, because there will be a light show and it is beautiful. After which you can drop by MBS to watch another light show. Overall, i must say, the scenic around Gardens by the Bay is way too beautiful at Night for a busy city/country like Singapore. #proudtobeaSingaporean"
"Enjoyed a nice couple of hours here. It was pleasant and most of the gardens are free to walk around. You can pay to visit the Cloud Garden and the Flower Dome. We chose to just do the Cloud Garden. I was a little disappointed with it considering it cost $32 for two. Again it's nice but nothing spectacular, it does give some nice views of Marina Bay Sands Hotel and would probably be much better at night time. Worth a visit if you are in the area but I wouldn't say it was a must visit especially if your time in Singapore is limited."
"Well , the place is great , dont get me wrong , but not worth the hype created around it. I probably expected more, It has various varieties of flowers and plants , but you would probably not need over an hour to check out the place. GO only if you are a big nature lover."
"The best part about our visit here was the light and sound show ( and that was free of charge - what an irony) - it is mind blowing what they have created and u need to c to believe. the rest of the attraction was good - different kind of trees, flora, fauna, jungle look and feel, definitely a must do if u visit Singapore though it may not be everyone's cup of tea. We went there during Christmas carnival so of course enjoyed the christmasy decor with snow and santa and reindeers - an added treat"
"We visited Gardens by the Bay on our recent trip to Singapore. We were actually meant to visit back in 2012 but ran out of time, so we were very much looking forward to visiting this time, as it would have had a couple of years to establish itself.From the moment you enter the park, it is just luscious greenery everywhere. I will be honest, I am not really one to admire plants and trees but walking around the gardens, I actually found it quite relaxing.We walked around for a little while and boredom started to slowly creep in, all the ""exciting"" stuff comes with a price. If you wanted to walk on the tree top bridge to look at the fantastic views, this was something you had to pay for. We payed our money and walked along the bridge, yes the views were fantastic, great photo opportunities but you only get 15 minutes to get from one end to the other. This becomes a little hard as there were selfie sticks everywhere and you were constantly waiting for people to finish up. The good thing was, they had a staff member constantly walking up and down making sure people were not just sitting there blocking the bridge up.We didn't visit the conservatories, again added extra. The children's play area looked like a lot of fun, it wasn't fully open as they were doing some maintenance work but what was open, kids were enjoying themselves.It ended up raining quite heavily when we were there, not a lot of places to wait undercover, especially if you in the middle of one of the gardens, you will get drenched.At the end of the day, we have seen it and did enjoy what we saw but if you are going as a family or large group and you want to see everything, be prepared to pay.I doubt that we will visit again anytime in future visits to Singapore."
"This is a nice place to enjoy a good walk and to relax away from the streets of downtown Singapore. You only have to pay if you want to enter the Cloud Forest (which is really great) and the Flower Dome (which is okay), that's currently 28S$ for both, a bit too expensive in my opinion. The SuperTrees are a lovely sustainable idea, and good for a photo or two. But having in mind that this is supposed to be a botanical garden with flowers from all over the world, I must admit that I have seen gardens that are much more interesting and offer more exotic plants."
"Unfortunately I apparently have cherry blossom allergies. Or perhaps it was the mad crush of people ......but if you are planning to attend an exhibit on the weekend, be prepared to brave the crowds. By the end of the queue to get in and the queue to go through the blossom corridor, I was hot and having allergy symptoms.I went to the other cooler lower temp pitcher plant and orchid haven instead and boy was that a relief. All in all a pleasant interlude for the hottest part of the day."
"It can be very busy so plan your trip, you can't go for a quick visit unless you break it into two trips.If you are not good with heights be realist about your decisions to view the sky or cloud areas.there is a 10% discount if you have proof of your Singapore air travel."
"The flower dome was worth it, not so much for the cloud forest. However, when we visited it the weather was too hot. This fact cause some of us gotten sick."
"The garden was well sculpted and had such a variety of plant life. We strolled across the bridges from lunch at the Shoppes at Marina. The walk around the Shoppes, through the Marina Sands Hotel and across the Dragon Fly bridges provided for excellent photo ops.Entry is free as you pay separately for access to the Conservatories and skywalks (around the solar trees). Plan on making a second trip at night to catch the trees lit up."
"The park is very huge that it's easy to get lost (Map is needed). Watch out for mosquitoes. Nothing too impressive during the day - maybe at night would be better. The free portion is good enough that maybe the domes might not be worth to pay to go to. If you visit, don't miss out on Marina Bay Sands nearby."
"The garden itself was amazing in design. However, it needs to add more plants varieties. It felt a bit empty inside the garden and the domes. The dome ticket was too expensive considering the size of the dome."
"We visited Gardens by the bay during Tulip show. It was very beautiful to see loads of Tulips around you. Overall average experience as i liked only Tulip show rest everything was ok for one time visit,"
"Good to see, since we have experienced a better Musical Fountain in Dubai, one of those as in flowers."
"Crowded on a weekend afternoon. As it is a tourist attraction, perhaps the management should review the entrance fee which is deem expensive to visitors from Asean. Directional signs should be improved. More security personnel should be statione."
"It's good way to spend an afternoon, kids and visitors love it. I like to see what themed display is happening in the flower dome! Everybody is always happy there gone."
"The garden has two different domes, the flower dome and the cloud dome. The flower dome was nice but the cloud dome was very average.The ticketing counter insisted us on buying the package ticket which includes the entrance fee for the two domes as well as the skywalk. However, the skywalk was closed due to bad weather.Suggestion: buy only the entrance tickets for the two domes. If the skywalk is open, the tickets for the same can be bought separately just outside its entrance."
"We went to Gardens by the Bay last July in late afternoon to celebrate my dog, Cookie 8 Birthday.The place was cool and greenery. Nice place to take dog(s) for walk.We had dinner at Satay by the Bay, one of our many favourites Singapore food. But we were disappointed that we missed the sound and light show."
"I can see the great efforts put into trying to create something nice and different.... However, the effects are still modest as compared to many other natural gardens or places where flower blossom so nicely during the different Seasons of the year.Great efforts, but nothing beats a natural environment."
"A bit disappointed actually. It has a lot of variety of flowers and plants, but they are all jammed inside this dome. I did take pictures too, but when I look around and saw hundreds of people queuing to do the same and try to get the perfect shot of that cherish blossom....I kinda felt sad. I would rather go and take pictures of those trees and flowers outside in a landscape. Less, but surely more rewarding."
"It was a public holiday when we visited which unfortunately made it a little hard to navigate the domes comfortably (too many people). We found ourselves a spot outside to view the light show and WoW!! we were totally amazed by this spectacular show, it was absolutely beautifulï¸"
i think its good...my son like it... overall its goodmaybe next time when i come back with my mom 'll take her to garden by the bay again
"I visited this place for the light show last week. It was quite boring. The plants are lit up with different lights and at 15 mins, it is too long."
I was so excited but got dismayed when I found out there were no tulips in the Gardens during my 1st week of June visit. I missed it as the tulip showcase was only until 4th week of May
If you are green fingers this would be must .You have the option of going to 1 or 2 enclosed vegetation rooms ( both are worth it ) I'm not that green but 1 hour was worth it for me .A Recommend from Team New Zealand
"Do come a visit to the 'Flower Dome' and 'Cloud Forest'. Enjoy the essence of the nature. It's a natural aromatherapy to our body. Stay till night, wait for the musical lighting shows. It's amazing!"
"The gardens themselves are very tranquil and pleasant to walk around.You can easily get lost amongst the flora and fauna. Please note that the cloud forest and the other indoor exhibit require you to pay to enter, whilst very nice its probably a one time thing to do and see. The cloud forest is freezing inside strangely. All in all a nice experience and worth the trip."
We had visited the garden at 11am..which is very hot day...it's much more beautiful if you visit this place after 4pm...when the sun is about to sunset...and the colorful lights on..
"I would not say it's a must see, but this is a very nice place to walk around on a hot day (as there is aircon in the huge glasshouse) or on a rainy day.You can just walk around and enjoy peaceful garden atmosphere with a large variety of plants. I like the carnivorous plants (with some kitch but very fun and well realised carnivorous plants in lego in the middle of the real plants). The big rainfall is nice.Photo lovers stop every meter.I preferred to skip the outside sky walk around as it was a long waiting line and the path seemed less long than I was expected."
Visited with family and my little gal was so happy to see the flowers as she is more attracted to greenery and colors and enjoyed exploring and enjoyed the waterfall at indoor amazing man made mountain.
"Interesting place to visit. However, it is very costly and I feel that the tickets can be cheaper. In fact everything is pretty expensive. Not suitable for the backpackers."
This is my second visit to Gardens by the bay.The first time we went it was night and we loved the light show.This time we decided to visit the rainforest and flower dome.It seems only Singaporeans can opt to visit only one dome so we had to pay for both.The rainforest dome is quite impressive at the top.I found the flower dome disappointing.The range of flowers was quite poor. On a side note we went to satay by the bay for lunch and no satay stalls were open which was disappointing.
Not the greatest thing you will ever see but it is definitely different. If your into flowers or just want a peaceful stroll with nice scenery then worth going to.
"The day we went a bit gloomy. Try to find a sunny day to visit the place.We managed to go on Skywalk after few minutes of argument. ($8/pax) They mentioned that it is close due to weather condition. But we saw people walking on it at that time. Then they agreed to sell it to us but we need to rush in case the weather getting windy or rainy.View was spectacular. We can see the park, Singapore Flyer and Marina Bay from up there. But they only allowed us to be up there for 15mins. And due to weather condition we were last person!Then we waited the light show. So pretty and magical. It was for about 5-10mins. The show only at 745pm and 845pm. Plan your visit wisely. And its FOC.The lights on the park stays on all night and you can visit anytime till late."
"This is a large and interesting garden area close to the Marina Sands Hotel complex. On a very hot day it is a suntrap but there are restaurants to take refuge in. It has the feel of a municipal park rather than an attraction. The metal flower structures are worth seeing and the sky walk between them affords a great view of the wheel, the hotel and the gardens. The main gardens are fee to look round- the walk is chargeable."
"Wings of Time is an unique and interesting Laser show in the evening. With a story line kind of narrative and combination of FIRE and Colorful lighting, the show is a must see."
Good place to visit if it rains the hot houses are both under covered. To get their use the MRT train system its a short walk from the station.
I find that the 2 domes' temperature were too cold & rather drastic temperature change when we have walked up ocbc skyway before reaching the domes.My boy catch a cold after he visited this place & been sick till now.
An interesting place for a stroll or if traveling with families. I am not much of a parks person but still was well worth the time and a quick walk through.
"oh the flowers, the colours, the variety of flowers, oh it was amazing to see so many flowers under one roof so well arranged. the scenic beauty was at its peek, i felt like i was in a diff. world. enjoyed thoroughly."
"Kind of a waste of a plan, but it's pretty nice. Quite unique. Even with bad weather it's still convenient to visit. One and done."
"Its a beautiful scene and an amazing scene to fathom. If you love lights, colors and glamour, you will definitely enjoy this. Great."
"I went there for the fact that people are saying the flower gardens in the park were stunning, but I think I have been too overwhelmed and when I go there on the last day of the flower exhibition it seems that the flowers are withering. The waterfall is a stunning one because of its size, but I don't think paying money for just looking at an artificial waterfall can make any impact on me. Remember to bring more clothes with you because the places are all highly air-conditioned.However, the open area is really worth for paying the visit, especially for the night performance of the sky tree. Went for the gardens by the bays at around 5pm and spent 2 hours in the two nest, and when coming out that's the right time for looking at the performance."
"They are impressive at night time, though we only saw them from the Marina Bay Sands, we did npt actually go into the park at night. During the day, a little disappointing, they are just gardens after all."
"definitely a must visit for all visitors. Best time to come is 5pm, visit the flower dome and the cloud forest some first and by 6.30-7pm the weather will be conducive to walk outside to the super trees walkway. There's a sound and light show by the super trees at 7.45pm so worth staying for that or plan it such that you are up the walkway during the show."
"This is a fascinating garden with cooled greenhouses and giant constructed ""trees"". It is an interesting experience but of course all is artificial."
Reached late in the evening but everything was closed by then. Visited a restaurant inside for dinner & liked the light & sound show.
food poor and service just about OK. not suitable for disabled people as there are many stairs to negotiate for the rooftop bar
if you love flowes it might worth the visit. It's cold inside the domes bring some warm jacket. The gardens surrounding the domes are nice and you might want to skip the domes.
"A huge place to roam around with all the beauty of its garden to appreciate with. I visited this place at night and ooh I just love this park with all the attractions from the flower dome, cloud forest and the supertrees which are so nice to look at night when all its lights were on :)"
"The outdoor gardens are massive and best explored on a cool, cloudy day, and avoid the weekends when the whole place is more crowded. Whether you like the two indoor air conditioned domes depends on your tastes, I guess. For me I prefer to see greenery in their original natural setting, not like, for example, imported tulips from Holland, no matter how nice the arrangement. It's a rather artificial to look up and see the glass dome rather than the sky. Oh, and end your visit near nighttime when the super trees are lighted up and the light show is on. That's probably the most beautiful aspect of these expensive gardens."
"Great location, very crowded, food choices pretty ordinary. Light show was worth seeing and the treetop walkway is unique. $8 for 15mins is a bit of a rip off however. Quite a bit of walking and quite hot. No really shaded places to sit and recover. Different, interesting but probably won't go back."
It was a very hot day when we were visiting. We enjoyed the space for about an hour then waited in the shade for our friends that did the paid walk on the canopy. I'm sure it would have been much better in the evening when it was cooler and the lights and music were going
"We went at night just to see the musical lightings. It was a big area with restaurants and gentle strolling areas like a garden. Nice for evening walk because it's cooler. Good for entertaining young children because the musical lightings were quite enchanting. However if you did not go, you have not miss much."
"We only visited the Cloud Forest dome. Giant waterfalls cascading down man-made 'mountain' covered in a variety of plants and flowers.The dome mists up 5 times a day (every couple of hours).Walk past the waterfall, take a lift and stairs (could take a second lift if can't do stairs) to the top and spiral down. Views over the city, Singapore Flyer and Marina Bar Sands hotel through the dome. Photo opportunities but a lot of people and you have to wind in between selfie sticks and people who have no sense of people around them.At the bottom you go through some theatre and information rooms which talk about the impact of Global warming, extinction of animals, caves and an overview of the gardens.Nice but not really spectacular.Didn't visit the flower dome.Due to the torrential rain we could not walk around the gardens as planned. They do have guided buses that take you round the various attractions."
"This place looks good from outside. When my friend said there are tulips in the garden, my wife was very excited, but she was disappointed after going inside. Overall not a bad place to visit."
Great place of greenery for people to visit during life in the urban area! However it is really hot and there are not that many places to go.
This place is beautiful and impressive aimply by sheer size. I am spoilt by having seen several botanical gardens in Australia where many of the same plants are. The art & architectural structures are by far the most impressive and worth a look. It felt odd to be walking on concrete looking at gardens with a skyscraper background - a real peoplw made vs nature vibe. Not a lot of natural beauty as there is man made sculpture.
"I had a morning visit to Gardens by the Bay walking from the City. Entering the garden from Marina Boulevard I could see the tantalizing tops of the Super Tree Grove and the glass of the tops of the Conservatories Domes. What a fabulous skyline! Walked along the well laid out paths and gardens to the Super Tree Grove which is in the free section of the garden. Lift up to the Skyway, great photo opportunities looking down into the whole garden.Gardens by the Bay is a technological, architectural and engineering triumph; built on over 100 acres of reclaimed sea which is astonishing. Spectacular, beautiful, amazing, exciting! There are over 100 acres of walk-able gardensThis is a show-piece for Singapore, and it is! However, finding a cafe or coffee shop or small shop selling water and cold drinks within the garden or at the Dome's entrances, nowhere to be seen, maybe I missed it. There were a couple of restaurants under the colonnade opening at lunch time. I asked the staff at the gift shop if there was a cafÃ©, they suggested I walk to the Marina!Singapore is hot, yes there are shuttle buses, still lots of walking in the garden, a place to sit have a cool drink and enjoy would I think be essential. Just a suggestion extend the gift shop to include a coffee shop and/or cafeteria.Adult tickets Skyway between The Super Trees $8Adult ticket for both Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest Dome $28"
"I'm not a fan of nature, but my friends want to see it.So i didn't impress that much. But If you love see nature, garden and stuff this place is must!"
The outside garden is normal. The trees inside the domes are interesting. It contains many huge and interesting trees. However some trees looked as if they are misplaced so many are not in good conditions. Some flowering plants need change and the work was done during our visiting time which I think is not proper. We stayed until dark to see light display. Good to have chairs to accomodate waiting watchers. The light display is rather normal.
"Hot, long and sweaty walk in the dark around lots of illuminated trees. Might be better to visit at dusk.Hawker market of satay by the bay was pretty good, but a long walk away."
nice concept... the place is huge and shall take about 3 hours to cover the whole... many areas are free for public and there are some areas for which you have to purchase ticket
Very good in lighting. Fresh air also. Try to come in afternoon and also norning. The best view is in the night. But for me the fee is so expensive. Because everytime want to look another we have to pay again.
"This is the place for you! A pretty oasis with plenty of information about plants, the planet, climate and so on. Plenty of gift shops and cafes/restaurants too."
Sprawling gardens. Visit at sundown or else it will be too hot to walk around. The light show at dusk is good.
"I did hear a lot about the garden by the Bay, but India have better garden nd flowers so didn't liked much.I did hear a lot about the garden by the Bay, but India have better garden nd flowers so didn't liked much."
these gardens might provide some relief in such a busy city but they aren't anything spectacular. the lift to the sky walk suggests you only have 15 minutes to get to the other end and exit for your $8 so that's a bit rich!! it's ok if it's not busy but probably doesn't need to be displayed - better to just manage it when it happens. structures are ok but if you're looking for beautiful gardens then i didn't see them here
"Went there because of their attractive advertisement. But when we get there, I can say there's nothing special. Just like a forest in an aquarium."
The big tree isn't really a tree at all and it's sort of a cheesy render of a sci-fi like scene to attract tourists. I would pass.
Was recommended many local friends that it is one of latest attraction and site to visit. Indeed it was.
"Definitely A for effort, very clean and children friendly. We came from the Helix Bridge and we almost got lost in the MBS Shoppes. There needed to be more accurate wayfinding. We decided to only see the free attractions. The highlight was the free Children's Garden and the Symphony of the Trees. Overall I thought the whole place was overrated, too boring for small children, too orderly and too manmade-like. Might be just the place for plant and garden lovers. Too bad I wasn't one."
"It was not that much interesting as expected, might be going when it's dark will bring some interest.Overall it was quite different with maintained garders, greenery & lovely crowd."
"Well organized man made park. Visit once is enough. The lighting show is just ok, not much excited. Lack off nature feeling"
Take a break from the concrete jungle. An expansive area where you can enjoy a relaxing man-made nature walk along the ocean.
Having bought my ticket to visit the domes before arrival I was disappointed to find the cloud dome closed. However I enjoyed visiting the other dome where there was a Chinese New Year exhibit. The 'metal' trees in the gardens are unusual and worth a visit. Wasn't able to go at night when they're lit up. Overall worth a visit.
I couldn't visit the actual place by person. But had the chance of viewing the same from the Marina Bay Sands. It as just a remarkable treatment to the eye of lights display.
Ok nothing great. Can be skipped if you have less time. Only good thing is it air conditioned so you can visit it in after noon as well
"We had heard lots of great things about the gardens, however were a little disappointed.We are not great garden enthusiasts, however enjoy beautiful settings. The walk ways felt like you were herded like sheep and difficult to go at a different pace to the person in front of you especially with everyone stopping to take photos and selfies of every flower they pass.It maybe more enjoyable during the evening when it would be less busy."
"Overpriced and nice to see, but hot and humid. Not one to repeat. Very touristy. Id slip and go to an indoor museum instead"
"Gardens by the bay are artificial gardens created on reclaimed land as a tourist attraction. Catch the MRT and walk around for free. you have to pay to enter the Eco domes and do the Supertree bridge walk. Very manicured, everything is controlled, looks great form a distance, very futuristic but the gardens lack character for me. I love gardens where nature has been able to run free."
Visited with my husband. Wanted to take the shuttle but the line was too big. Had a short walk through the garden.
"Gardens by the bay us an artificial garden created on reclaimed land as a tourist attraction. Getting there by public transport requires quite a bit of walking, and remember to bring your umbrella because its always very warm and sunny in singapore. A great place to visit would be the eco domes, but theres an admission fee."
We went there at night. And there were a show in the middle that playing lights with songs.People watched it while lie down on the floor and listening to the songs and blinking lights in the garden.It was played about 7.45pm (if im not mistaken)
"Flower dome carried different theme every few months.. It was tulip on spring, and Christmas wonderland in December. The rain forest dome was the same all year. Restaurant a bit pricey though.."
"I have visited this attraction a number of times and have always thoroughly enjoyed the stunning displays and been delighted to recommend it. Sadly on this occasion it was 'change-over' time and many of the displays were passed their best. My issue with this is that we were notified after we had paid to go in. Added to which the Children's Water Play Park was shut for maintenance. Please, managers of this attraction, notify visitors on arrival at the pay desk."
"This place does have potential but it is not yet complete. Once the plants have fully grown it will no doubt be spectacular but it is a little lacking now. The light show is pretty tacky but if you happen to be in the area it is worth a quick visit. I should qualify that we did not venture into the domes, doing so may make the visit more worthwhile."
"It is a very good concept of green reservation. There were 2 dome museum of all trees, plants and flowers around the world. We had tried to eat at a Indochina Restaurant at the top of the tower. But it was very expensive and the foods and service were very bad. Should improve!"
It was so interesting and beautiful. Would hv been great if we didn't pick a day after huge storm to visit. Lots of the more interesting bits were shut due to health and safety (wet high walk isn't too cover I guess). Night views I imagine wld hv been gorgeous too. Had a bit of difficulty finding it .... The bus stop wasn't just 2 min away as Google said....
I admire the tourism department of Singapore...they have a knack of putting up a grand show of average things...nice outing place but no value for money!!
I was wanting a tropical paradise but I found the outdoor gardens to be rather uniformly green! Perhaps it was the time of year? (February). Parts of it were also closed for gardening work. The flower dome was more colourful but it was freezing cold because of the air conditioning. The cloud forest was impressive but again cold.
"Cloud Forest is fully man made, the other part Flower dome is very nice. Musical lighting at the end of the day is very good."
"My wife and I recently used Singapore as our hub when visiting Cambodia, so our time in Singapore was limited. Having first seen the gardens beautifully lit up from 'the flyer' we thought them worthy of further investigation.As we entered the gardens about 8pm most people were leaving and the exit points were a little crowded, the 2 exhibition domes were closed whilst we were there (I'm unsure of their opening hours) and we found the gardens to be a little too dark to enjoy - as I guess they were trying to showcase the lights of the giant mushroom / tree like structures.We visited the Botanical Gardens and the Chinese / Japanese gardens at the edge of the city and found these mush more organic, peaceful, less commercial and more beautiful (see reviews)."
It is a beautiful walk through the gardens on the way to the ticket booth. We had a long day and so just decided to take our son to the children's garden which was a free exhibit. We walked down to where that particular exhibit was and it was barricaded off with a sign saying it would be closed until sometime in April. There were no signs at the ticket booth or other kiosks around the garden.
"The artificial supertrees are fun, but also characteristic: this garden has a rather artificial flavour."
This is very beautiful garden.You can go inside without any ticket.There is a light and sound show in the evening which is good. This show happens every one hour.
"Look, they have done these gardens really well. It's a huge area just behind the Marina Bay Sands complex, which can be accessed either from the hotel via elevated walkway, or through the MRT underpass from the Bayfront station.There always seemed to be a long queue at the ticket counter, and 58.- SGD for 2 adults is not cheap.The Flower Dome is just that, a huge and cold dome with lots of flowers, and busloads full of Chinese old people and school classes, so that walking becomes a bit of a chore.The outside gardens are worth a visit too, however personally I find walking in 35C heat and 90% humidity for hours a bit challenging.To sum up, it's well worth a visit, but I suggest you plan your approach in advance(eg pre-buy your tickets and stock up on water), and keep the outdoor strolls to a minimum.Also, only the cooled conservatories and the Skyway require a ticket, if you just want to stroll through, you can do that free of charge."
"If you are into plants, do visit, there are thousands to view - trouble is only some are actually identifiable with labels, so most of the time as the crowds wander, you can hear ""what's that one? Is that a...? I dunno.."" Perplexing but everyone seems very fond if it. Perfect for a hot day outside as the AC is brilliant. Probably a bit overpriced."
"The light show is nothing much to behold if you have been to Disneyland/Disneysea. The conservatory is too packed, they should have limited the number of people in the area at any given time. The walk is a bit long during hot weather, we get all sweaty after a while. There is no clear signboard to guide how to get to the conservatories without going through all the location, or how to go to the MRT."
in general is ok and a new experience anyway in singaporeprepared a very comfortable outfit to walk around if you enjoy to walk..some access need to be paid and some outdoor garden open for public.. if you are feeling not to walk to main spot then easily paid 3 sin$ per person for free shuttle and better to buy a ticket of attraction in the main entrance..but you also can buy the ticket on each point of interestto enjoy minimun spend half day to really enjoy the whole gardens
"With 3 different themed gardens in one big space, it is difficult to cover in one evening. In the start, you will love every corner and click pictures with every plant, flower and tree. The enthusiasm fades away in max 20 minutes. A must visit is the cloud forest...loved the waterfall!Tip: Plan your visit on a weekday and start by 4ish. This way you will have enough time to explore and by evening you can witness the light show at the garden area."
"As much as I enjoyed the beautiful flowers inside the building, it felt somewhat unnatural to be inside an enclosed building instead of open area, lack of wind and insects/animals."
"The ticket process is cumbersome, first a queue to get a buggy ride,$3, then another queue to get entrance ticket, the queues were soooo long in the heat. We visited only the Cloud dome. It's an ideal place for plant lovers, rain forest setting. We did not want to stand in another queue to get into the Flower dome."
"Nice place to visit and walk around but very very busy so the relaxing flowers, trees, and waterfalls can easily be lost with people trying to barge past you.The place is free to walk around, but the main attractions like the cloud forest cost to entre. You can get a ticket for the golf-cart-esk bus that takes you from one side of the park to the other for a couple of dollars, but if you're there to see the free bits then walking is the only way."
"the garden for me its not really spectacular... we have more bigger garden in Indoneisa - Bogor to be precise , which have more variant of trees and flowers including the famous "" bunga bangkai"" ( biggest rafflesia flower ). this place is nicer to visit at night so we can see the gardens with many colored lights."
This is one of the main tourist attractions in Singapore. Quite expensive but glad we did it and was nice to see all the nicely decorated gardens.
"A refreshing view of plans and waters; a lovely light show from the super Trees. I regret that we didn't go to the OCBC Skyway; we could have experienced the lights upclose and personal. nevertheless, the light show can be seen from afar, and it is quite OK for me."
"Gardens by the Bay looks and feels like a Disney experience with good intentions for protecting the environment. In the end, the space in theory is awesome but misses the mark. I truly question if they are meeting their vision with their initial intentions with sustainability and protecting the environment.Several things were concerning to me:* They pipe in bird and natural sounds into the gardens* McDonald's has a prominent space as a vendor and they are know to be a major polluter, destroyer of forests and maltreatment of cattle and chickens* Stalagmites were taken from their natural cave environment and put on display* The rainforest space is suppose to be like a rain and cloud forest and they are far from the real experience-- plants change little from elevation to elevation, the a/c is freezing inside the building, few palms and other exotic trees are present, impaciens are used as a flower filler whenever there is a hole in color, lack of orchid variety, etc.* Little information is talked about how people can help save the earth even with tthehe film on the lower level* Students from other countries should be given a discount admission rate as they will be movers and shakers to solve this global crisis"
"It is very creatively decorated place, with a wide variety of plants and music going on in the gardens, the skywalk is one good attraction. the entry fee is very nominal. During weekends it is very crowded."
"Nice ""Avatarized"" garden at the Bay of Sungei Singapura that was built to attract visitors, local and foreign."
"This is one of the most interesting places in Singapore. The large gardens on free air, the two conservatories can make every nature lover extremely happy. I have spent there 6, literally six, hours walking around and admiring this great work. I liked this place very much. What I did not like? Two things.1. the prices - you are local then you pay less, you are foreigner then you have to pay more. This is first place where I have seen such discrimination of foreigners.2. the crowds of people who are not really interested in the gardens. I had a feeling that their major and only goal to make self-photo everywhere. The fill the whole space with cameras on stick and brainlessly doing photos of their faces with different background every few seconds.If you wish to enjoy these gardens then go there during a regular day, as early as possible to avoid crowds. This way you may see something without major disruptions. Good luck."
It's a nice place .... but I am not impressed . It's a place if you really have nothing else to do or go
"Made a quick visit to Gardens by the Bay - to be honest I was not impressed. Its scenic and interesting from a horticultural perspective, but nothing exceptional here.If you do visit then do take the extra ticket and visit both domes - they are the best part about this attractionCentrally located, plenty of transport nearby."
It was good to visit. Nice light show. good space and a must watch place. It is a USP of Singapore. Better to visit post 7:00 PM local time.
"The section housing the cloud mountain was just wow! An almost 6 storeyed waterfall was among the most amazing sights. The rest of the garden was just an ok place to visit...something you may tick in your list, but not really recommend to others"
"Nice enough gardens to wander for couple of hours but nothing on scale of Eden Project in UK. General area interesting, number of eating places nearby, sculptural structures were good."
"A collection of potentially quite ordinary plants from a range of continents. European plants were not at all exotic, they grow in our garden at home. Likewise possibly the offerings from ""Australia"" and ""California"". A pleasant enough 90 minutes, but the whole glass bubble was air conditioned within an inch of its life which we felt was entirely unnecessary either for the plants or the visitors. The ""cloud forest"" dome has the highlight with a more sensible humid warm climate control with impressive towering vertical plant displays and fake waterfalls. The second highlight was the window cleaners abseiling down the outside of the dome.So called ""super trees"" look good illuminated at night from atop the Marina Bay Sands building, but up close by day look tacky and could have been transplanted from. a North London adventure playground. The aerial walkway between the SuperTrees was OK, but eminently missable. Signage around the attraction is very poor and the map provided does not fully represent the layout.The onsite Pollen Restaurant we found unnecessarily pretentious as a lunch stop. We were not allowed to place our daypacks on the floor, each had to have its own special ""handbag stool"" to sit on. Whatever! Also the coldest eatery in Singapore - wholly unnecessary and we left earlier than planed as we were so cold, even with two layers on!!"
Taking a walk from Marina Bay to the gardens is a nice relaxing affair for a weekend but actually the gardens I thought were quite average and the skywalk pretty dull.
"I have only visited once since I have lived in Singapore. I went over the Christmas/New Year period, which was the worst time to go.I knew it would be busy, but didn't think it would be so bad!I would recommend buying tickets in advance (i.e. in the tourism counter in Chinatown), and then you can go straight into the domes without queuing.The domes themselves are interesting ' more so that what was inside them, in my opinion. They are also nice and cool, which is a nice break from the heat outside.I haven't been back since. It is just a place to send visitors to Singapore when they have some time to kill."
"I have come here is about 3 years ago, n yesterday i come here again and i dont see the different with 3 years ago. If you dont have came here you must try, but if you have i think you must find another attraction in singapore"
I went there with my wife during the day. Was a nice walk around and went on a little tour which was quite interesting.We returned there on a night tour and experienced the light and sound show. It was quite good at the night show.
Flower dome was a nice experience. They change the theme from time to time i guess. So many variety of flowers. The cloud forest however gave me more of a sophisticated. The waterfall is entirely man made and there s nothing much to observe. However it was a good experience.
"Rather disappointed. At first sight the artificial trees and the glass domes look spectacular but we found the flower dome to be underwhelming. There were very few flowers wheras on the website the pictures gave the impression that the whole area was stuffed with flowering plants and very colourful. Possibly the time of year we visited. Didn't get back to see the light show on the trees, will do ghat next time."
The day we were in Singapore it decided to piss rain. It stopped for a short period of time so we decided to try our luck and check out the gardens as the forecast also predicted it wont rain for a couple hrs. We were wrong...They also closed the treetop walk in the super tree grove due to the bad weatherAlso expect to pay entry fees for all the different gardens inside. Roughly about $5 each entrance
"Went during the pre-Christmas period where there are a lot of decorations up, an outdoor food market and super duper crowded. I didn't opt to visit the greenhouses, and think I need to visit and enjoy the place when there are less people. Otherwise a really different gardens experience."
"Went there cause i thought that it'll be a nice place for my grandma to visit last month. However, i realize that the place (be it the open gardens or the indoor ones) is only good for a 1 time visit. I've been there a few times and i realize that the staffs at the gardens are getting more rude and unprofessional. For example when I was buying the tickets for the indoor domes, this staff that served me was just talking to his friend beside on what to eat for dinner. Most of the staffs there kept using their phones as well when they are supposed attend to customers. The food there are just so so, it will be better to go to other hawkers or restaurant to eat. The indochine restaurant located around the supertree grove is good though. They serve decent food and drinks over there and when you go up you get to view the spectacular view of the ferris wheel and MBS at night! :)"
"Visited the gardens on a rainy day, so the sky walk was closed. We did the train tour of the gardens which is given in English. This gave us a good overview of the gardens.The tickets for the train tour are sold at the information desk - beside the sign that says they don't sell tickets!We ate lunch near the flower dome and it wasn't bad. Service was slow. It was good too sit and relax though.The super trees are excellent - but probably best seen at night."
This was a nice place to have a walk around. We didn't actually go inside but took some snaps around the open areas outside. We went at night great for views of the marina and a nice place for some shopping as there are malls bear by. Overall not amazing but was good as a casual place to look around. There is a Ferris wheel outside which looked good and some nice restaurants too. We went to Lau Pausat (street food area) afterwards and it was great to try some Satay which was done in a large open street area with people inviting you in to try some food.
"A very nice place to go to after a hectic day in the city. Lights used to make it look somewhat magical. We went there during evening, and i really recommend that. Could be good during day time as well, especially if you are interested in the plants and flowers. After seeing various Disney etc shows of similar kind, the super tree show was somewhat unimpressive, unfortunately. They should really think if they can tell a story with the lights, not just make them blink. But since you are there in the evening anyways, no harm done seeing it..."
"No question - these glass domes and their surroundings are spectacular, and many people will be fascinated by them.However, to me it seems absurd to erect massive, air-conditioned domes, cool the air inside to 15 degrees and fill it with plants from everywhere else in the world and an ""indoor waterfall"". Especially in a city like Singapore, that has beautiful parks and arguably one of the most beautiful botanical gardens in the world with free entrance.Apart from this, the indoor waterfall area (cloud forest) looks like a multi-storey car park from the inside, which is already covered with algae and mould and is in need of renovation. Also, tickets are quite pricey (approx 25 SGD) and the attraction is not that large. When we were there, the treewalk was closed for maintenance.Nonetheless, if you are sensitive to the hot and humid climate in Singapore or have a particular interest in giant glass structures, this is a good place to see plants. If this is not the case, I suggest you skip this attraction and head to the Singapore Botanical Garden!"
Let me start with what we did not like...they advertise cloud forest and flower dome but they don't tell u that it's no use visiting the cloud forest post 6pm since u can't see anything so we had to go for the 2nd option of the flower some...while my wife liked it I personally found it over rated..we could not figure out the flowers under artificial lighting....and for 20+ dollars I would have preferred giving it a miss...what is really superb is the light and sound show in the evening at gardens by the bay which u should not miss
"The Gardens by the Bay was almost as great as most of the reviews written below, but it took me forever to find out a way on how to actually GET there!I wanted to walk there from the Promenade and ended up in a cul-de-sac (dead end?) at a highway. After asking around, I found out that it's accessible through the metro station or by walking on the bridge through the Hotel to the other side. But for that I had to go back to the shopping center, and try to find the escalator up to the pedestrian bridge. It wasn't indicated on ANY of the maps of the mall. Only after walking around for a bit did I finally find a small sign indicating the location of that escalator.So by the time I actually arrived at the entrance of the Garden, I was already a bit frustrated about no proper signage. I guess if I had bought a guidebook it would have been better?"
It was beautiful but we are not plant lovers so we only spent like one hour in the garden then walked to the Sands. It may be a good idea to bring the kids their swimming suits and towels because there is a water playing area with loud music for them..
It is good for young children. Not worth the money you pay but you do get to spend an hour or so in a cool place. We did it once and will probably will not do it again.
There were some unique plants and flowers but a lot of there stuff looked very familiar. It is inside a glass dome which is cooled to accommodate the plants. It was nice but not that unique to me
If you have few days in Singapore then go to this place .I did not find very impressive but evenings are good. Light show is very good. Cloud dome is ok but flower dome is good.overall it's a nice place
"Pretty impressive with the place, it took to long to get the bridge between the tree. and it is very very HOT during the day. Bring umbrella, hat, sunblock or anything to cover your skin."
Beautiful how the garden and waterfall fit in the dome. May be best bring warm clothes as it can get chilly inside. Generally need appreciate botanical plants to enjoy this place. Not high on my place to visit priority.
"Have entered this attraction through the MRT station you go up in a lift to walk through the prestigious Marina Bay hotel with what looks like a boat stuck on its three pillars, there again it look like a desert island( or perhaps the designers could not decide what theme they were aiming for) We went on Chinese New Year's Day and to say it was crowded would be an understatement. The review will have to reflect that. I headlined that this was a nice walk and it was in order to keep away from the crowds that were queuing to enter the glasshouse attractions and the skywalks. I am sure that on a quieter day we would have enjoyed it more and be able to see the attractions that were queued out. You can only speak as you find."
"We visited here in Chinese New Year what we saw was great but the queues for tickets were so long and not enough desks open we never got any further, shame."
"We went to explore these gardens and were a little disappointed. The skywalk was interesting but not all that extraordinary. But since the ticket for it was cheap I guess it was that much of a rip off.We also went to the two glass domes and I must say the cloud forest was quite interesting. The entrance was quite satisfying with the waterfall and the atmosphere throughout was quite pleasing. However, the flower gardens dome was quite boring in my opinion as there was not much to do apart from look at flowers.I guess this place is worth a visit and maybe it was just not to my taste."
"Look it's very nice, very educational, but just feels so fake. Been there twice now, will not go again"
"The admission to the garden is free. There are two attraction within the garden that has an admission fee called ""Cloud forest"" and ""Flower dome"" and I wouldn't recommend them unless you have nothing else to do in Singapore and just want to while away time. Coming back to the garden itself. It is really well maintained and the musical show that start around 8PM is really amazing. Pay the garden a visit only if you plan to go at night."
I bought the ticket to go inside but there were too many people to spend a good time sight seeing anything in the garden.
Didn't enjoy it that much. although the flowers are very pretty the heat and humidity when we went tired us out sowe were unable to really appreciate everything.
Just like most garden but The supertrees are the centre of attractions. Do wait around 7.30-745pm for the light show. You might want to be there early to find a nice spot for the show.
"If you come from Europe, the cloud forest and the other are so boring.... But the garden and super tree are amazing."
it is a huge garden. You can walk around the whole day there and enjoy the Singapore view from the top.
I think this is best seen in the evening... might be a good idea to go late afternoon and then hang around for the light show in the evening
"Nice gardens, and the light show is so beautiful, but the real gems are the covered zones: the rain forest and flower garden. They may be worth it, but for budget travellers, we could not afford to go into those sections. Super expensive...but hey, that's Singapore."
"Having been told that this was a must see in Singapore, I was slightly disappointed. Ok the flowers are beautiful and the layout was decent but I failed to understand the popularity.If you like walking through busy greenhouses then this is for you. Me not do much."
We come here when we visited marina bay with free singapore tour from Changi. It is near from marina bay sands and also merlion park.
I went because i heard its a must but i didnt actually enjoy because you take pictures with yes wonderful views and flowers but after a while i got bored.
"We went in the evening to this and it was hard to see the displays. It looks enticing to go, but once there it's quite expensive and you have to pay for each side. Probably not worth the time, money and trouble of getting here."
"Its great for all those nature lovers. Please remember, if you are coming from a green country, it may not impress you much. Light and sound show (free entry) two shows in evening are just OK. Nothing great."
"If you're staying at Marina Bay Sands, then take a walk across the road and check this out. If not, then go to the botanic gardens"
"In sunny Singapore, weather is basically hot outdoors. So by paying to enter the 2 domes, you're basically paying for the aircon while you enjoy the beauty of the plants.I'm not a botanist nor a plant lover, so I don't really appreciate the plants. I think it would be better to come only when there's an event such as having an imported Holland tulip mini exhibit."
"Its good . Dont miss cloud forest. Its worth the money. Well designed and maintained. We used the shuttle train too, as its hot and muggy to walk around."
"Gardens aren't high on my priority list of things to do when travelling, so this may be an unfair review as I was never going to get too excited. Its an impressive piece of nature but in all honesty, I found it a bit boring."
"With great expectations, my family and I (husband and self, 2 teenage children, 2 elderly parents in their 80's) took taxis to the Gardens. We'd have taken the MRT, but the walk from the MRT exit looked to be quite long - too long for my elderly parents. Good taxi drop off point.Hotel staff had suggested we go towards the end of the day, to see the tall towers lit up, which we did. We arrived at about 5pm. Domes are magnificent (S$28pp entry for both domes). For diversity of flora, and as an educational source, absolutely excellent - plants from all over the world. What we weren't told, however, is that although the domes are open after dark, there is very little lighting provided, so we were walking around in almost darkness by the time we reached the cloud dome. There were some spotlights on some plants/displays, but I needed to use the flashlight app on my iphone to actually see the plants and flowers up close. That was disappointing.The lit up towers at night were beautiful.Best tips: see inside the domes before darkness falls. Have a coffee and wait for the towers to be lit up after dark. Also, we weren't told until we were leaving that there were wheelchairs available (for rent??) for my elderly parents - they were very tired after all the walking - check at the information counter.Worth a visit if you are botanically-inclined."
"We went here in the evening so that we could see the sound and light show. It was very good but there wasn't many proper places to sit so we had to lay down on the ground. This may have been so due to the fact we went on a Saturday. Therefore, it may be better to visit on weekdays. They garden is huge so wearing comfortable shoes is advised. A disappointment was that the line to buy tickets for the OCBC Skyway (a suspension bridge between the Skytrees) was extremely long so we didn't bother going on it."
"Another place to walk by and take a couple of quick pics to put on FB. Don't expect much and you will do fine here. Also, it's better to come at night -- it's a bit nicer with the lighted trees."
"Unfortunately was quite short on time, so didn't have the opportunity to look inside the conservatories. The Supertree Grove is good to see, it started raining during our trip which meant the high walkway was closed."
I went at night and while the gardens look great under lights I think it would have been better during the day. Just didn't expect to find so much to do so ran out of time.
"With the very important proviso that we didn't go into any of the paying attractions, we were seriously underwhelmed by these gardens. First of all, they are dwarfed by a horrible ugly skyscraper development consisting of 3 tower blocks. The gardens are very Disney world and there are wide, concrete paths. There are garish signs, which may be educationally interesting for children. We still feel that the Botanical Gardens offer an unparalleled delight and strongly recommend them as unmissable, PS Entry to the attractions was pretty pricey"
We visited only the cloud forest and the flower dome and were quite surprised with the amazing architecture. The place indoors so they have air conditioned the gardensIf you have less time you can opt to skip this or do only these two gardens of all the gardens as they are the most amazing ones.
"Upon our visit to Gardens by the Bay, we were mesmerized on how huge this garden is.We suggest that you visit this place around late afternoon since when the night comes, it gets pretty dark and could almost see nothing. It seems that they refrain from putting too much lights as to not damage the plants."
Was very crowded and the fun fare was a rip off. Nothing to shout about even if it's for free. Only thing good was the atmosphere.
"You have to pay for the best bits, but I guess that is fair enough, spent a pleasant hour wandering around"
Had 4 hours between meetings here in Singapore so decided to see this in that time. Taxi was easy to get there and price for both Cloud Forest and Flower Dome was reasonable. Both were interesting without any real wow factor. It is cool inside the domes which can be a relief during the heat or a bit too cool if you dont have something to keep warm.The signage within the gardens is excellent to find your way around.I am sure this would all look better at night too with lights and such but i didnt get chance to see it that way.
This place is interesting and nice to look at but that's about it. I've been here last time I visited Singapore and it was okay. Very interesting concept though
"Unless there is a flower exhibition/show, one sees more plants than flowers including cactus. This those who pay the entrance fees expecting flowers should do some homework."
"Don't pay for the gardens as you can have access to basically the same ones all over the country. However, the free part at night feels like being on another planet with all the lighting. You should go by night!"
"Despite being an admire of science and progress, I found the Gardens by the Bay a tad spooky for my liking. In the Flower Dome you can wander through different gardens in different Ecosystems - the Argentinian garden, the Mediterranean garden etc etc. While in the Cloud Forest you get to see a real rain forest with a gigantic waterfall.There is much more to see in the Gardens by the Bay but you need a lot of time. Definitely worth a visit but be prepared for a disappointment if you visit this after the Botanic Garden"
"My family and I visited the Christmas Wonderland @ gardens by the bay last December 2015.we tried for 2 days by car to get into the park hit it was jam packed with so many cars and the queue was so long.so finally on Sunday we thought we were so smart and parked at marina bay sands.Lo and behold it seems the whole of Singapore also parked there.Walking across the bridge to get to the bay was a nightmare to begin with.When we reached the park...oh my goodness..the amount of people there was scary.One couldn't walk without brushing past another sweaty human.We had to buy tokens to play games, and there was only one booth to buy from, so you can imagine the queue.I queued for 45mins! I saw another token booth but it was closed.shouldnt they open more booths to serve the mad crowd?Basically it was so crowded that we couldn't enjoy the games nor the beautiful lights there as people were constantly pushing around the move.Gardens by the bay staff should have had some crowd control, not let so many people into the park.Firstly, it was hard to even walk there.Secondly, you can't even stop to enjoy the scenery.First and last time going to such outdoor events at Gardens by the bay."
We went by night to visit the show light thinking it would be very cool but it ended up being something pretty normal with music and lights changing and that was it.
"We had heard how wonderful this place was. We were disappointed. Too much concrete, expensive to enter conservatories. Some nice gardens in the precinct but there is much more to Singapore than this. Have a look but we found it underwhelming and overrated."
"We made the mistake of going late in the day. I assumed if it was open until 9pm this would not be an issue, but it was hard to see. The whole display had been ruined by the placing of Christmas displays. We went to see the gardens, not a whole heap of Christmas trees with attendant reindeer, father Christmas etc. The building is amazing but I do not believe it was presented to his maximum effect because of the Chrsitmas stuff"
"It is ok. Just that the weather is too hot to wander around the gardens in the daytime. The domes are both a good area to explore and escape the heat. Overall, it is just average."
"Didn't expect a place like this in Singapore - nice change from the concrete jungle! I got a combo ticket to both conservatories and really enjoyed them. After a hot walk around looking at the giant trees, & themed gardens it was a refreshingly cool change to go have a look at the foliage and flowers and the indoor waterfall. You could spend a lot of time here and it would be a nice thing to do with friends and family alike - worth a visit!"
Very interesting tour bus ride. Good commentary. The garden is well laid out and has some very interesting features.
"I hate to be negative, but the gardens was not my cup of tea. I visited this place with my sister and she loved it, but it wasn't really for me. It is very cold inside, and I get cold easily, if you are like me I recommend you take a jacket. It also very busy inside."
"We visited the gardens and the conservatories, as well as the skyway. I am sorry to say that but I was not impressed. My local botanical garden costs a third of the price and is much nicer. Take a sweater with you, the air conditioning is so strong that I was freezing cold in the conservatories. The skyway is the only thing I could somewhat recommend. It has a nice view at night."
Very expensive to walk around and look at flowers wouldn't do it again. $20 or more dollars is very overpriced
A must see in singapore with beautiful foliage and unique buildup. You must visit all 03 there and make sure your phone is charged n camera has a full battery for the great shootouts of the very unique plants and flowers. U need the whole day there if u are to relax and enjoy.
"Too artificial, like the outside garden and view way better than the domes. One time is enough to see the domes, next visit I will spend time outside instead."
"This place is very nice ! Strong recommend oversea and local visitors to visit this place for at least once. It's big, nice and free. However, the paid visit into the 2 Domes was very disappointed. The plants are nice but... just normal. And the entrance fee is not cheap."
"December Christmas decorations beautiful lighting!Suitable for family and children special events ,playground,photo taking,ice skating experience!"
"I like adventure. I checked this out, because it had so many reviews. I thought it was pretty, but nothing special. Of course, the metal trees are iconic, but wouldn't go again. The cost was also a little much to me. It was $12 for one dome and $28 for two. If you like taking your time and looking at plants, definitely go. Otherwise, I would say it's a waste of time."
"This place is Ok. I was underwhelmed by the plants that were on show, but the massive Supertrees were nice."
Very nice walk and gardens were beautiful. There was a lot to see and ground to cover. I highly reccomend baking the gondola rides to the different points to see everything.
I was there on 25 december and it was soooooooo crowded we cant even walk.The lights were so beautifully set . It was worth visitting and its freee!
Time of year we went was peak season (around Christmas and New Years ) so it was very crowded. I have seen giant old growth trees out in nature so I didn't think this man made attraction was any special. although I think it is well built and specimens inside are great.
Didn't enter because it was pricey. The view from outside was enough. It's just plants and such nothing special
Good indoor attraction if you want an air conditioned environment. Something unique but probably wont enjoy it much if you are used seeing nature in its purity.
"Very crowded, maybe go early in the morning to avoid heat and some of the crowds...Good satay and seafood spot for dining... But you need to walk a while to find it...Travel there on the MRT or get a taxi..."
If you like different species of flowers then this is the best place for you. Best place to take photos.
"First time i went there for the exhibition, just ok for me. Not exciting.The flower dome is interestingCloud dome not very good, there isnt something that wuah in there, just so cold.OCBC skyway is ok too, have many spot to take picture."
Gardens by the bay won a couple of International awards but honestly I didn't enjoy it that much. Yes it's a huge greenhouse (2 actually) and yes they have a lot of different species of plants but for me it was not that much interesting.I just liked the waterfalls in the cloud forest and the sky bridge inside was good to take some photos!!!
"beautiful sets.. love the flowers. go there when there were tullips from Netherlands. for us Asians, we rarely seethis flower. No needto go further for beautiful tullips. They are colorful and fresh. must go!"
"Gardens by the bay is undoubtedly a very beautiful place and the conservatories 'Flower dome' and 'Cloud forest' are exceptional. Cloud forest was unlike anything we had seen before. Do check out the 'misting' times before you visit.The only downside was the HUGE crowds during Christmas week and it looked like the gardens weren't equipped to handle a crowd so massive!! People jostling for place, kids crying... Too much chaos. The Christmas decorations and lighting was spectacular. The taxi stand was no less than a battlefield.Do avoid going at such peak tourist periods if you can"
The dome with the waterfall was OK with all the flowers and also the Skyway walk up in the treetops but otherwise for the money there was not that much to see.
You can spend a whole day there walking around. The two domes are worth visiting if you love flowers and nature.
"Place was crowded when we visited it. Tickets were 28S$ for two concervatories which was quite a lot. Cloud forest was looking awesome tough. You can see gardens and super trees for free, only concervatories costs"
"We visited Gardens by the Bay and we were expecting something spectacular but the cloud conservatory has a huge waterfall but coming from Australia we have seen much better in Tasmania and Kakadu (Northern Territory) so man made was never going to beat it. Many of the flowers in the other conservatory were similar to home except they didn't look as well as ones that see the sun and fresh air. The metal trees were impressive and for people who haven't travelled into natural landscapes around the world they would find it very interesting but for us it was a bit boring, hard to get to on foot and dissapointing."
Garden by the Bay is for kids attraction. Nothing much.various species can be found in both flower dome and forest dome. Unless you are photo enthusiast or botanist I won't suggest this place. Children enjoy in shower play area.
"Flower dome, cloud forest etc are structures within this large area almost like a botanical garden with some good views from heights and also light and sound shows... Good for a one-time visit.... Can spend almost an entire day here if you wish to cover in detail..."
"This appears to be one of the main attraction in Singapore. It was crowded and it appeared the whole Singapore was there. Lots of variety of flowers from the different part of the world. However, it doesn't even come close to what you can see and enjoy the beautiful Bushart Gardens outside Victoria, Canada."
We reached late and could visit only the flower dome. Nicely decorated but a bit too crowded. Skywalk tickets were sold out. You need to be early to see the place. Reach by 4. The information desk at the entry is helpful
Visited the location on 11th Dec to specially enjoy the 'Garden Rhapsody' light and sound show but was disappointed. In the past all the normal lights were switched off to maximize the impact of the 'Garden Rhapsody' light and sound show but this time around a lot of the lights were left on and there were lots of little stalls all of which negatively impacted on the 'Garden Rhapsody' light and sound show. Will avoid visiting during festivals.
"It was VERY crowded, my daughter seem does not enjoys it.But the place is so beautiful.f you're into lights and luminaries, you should definitely drop by. If you're also into sculptures and taking pictures , this is such a picturesque place."
Was bringing my family there for Christmas fun fair but think that it is too overprice and not really fun for my kids.
"We came here after Christmas and I had hoped crowds would be less, but there were tons of people when we arrived. Ticket line was 30 minutes. We went to cloud forest and then flower dome. Honestly, it wasn't so much the crowds that were a problem but the total lack of any crowd control. For example, for cloud forest you can go up to 7th floor but they stopped elevator operations for floors 1-6 and so I had to take the stroller down the escalator for each floor. There was no staff overseeing the crowds except at the entrance.We ate at satay by bay and it was not impressive. I would find something else to eat.If I had to choose I thought botanical gardens were nicer and more relaxing."
"This is a very beautiful park and the lights during the night would be a photographer's dream, with great views of the Marina Sands hotel. However our experience was sub par, due to the overcrowding during Christmas. The park isn't designed to handle so many guests, and they had ushers moving us along like cattle at choke points. Long queues for everything including lifts to get from one level to another. And the worse part? The toilets. For a park of this size, I cannot fathom how the park planners decided to only have on central toilet, and worse of all, only 2 -3 cubicles to handle crowds of thousands.We wanted to get a ticket onto the SkyWalk to avoid the crowd, but even that was sold out."
"This tourist attraction is just behind(or in front) of Marina Bay Sands building complex. Two attractions are connected by a bridge over a highway. Gardens by the Bay is also very easy to get to by metro subway.During the day I could imagine it would be quite boring--just some strange man made tree branches. However, at night they all come alive with all the lights, projections and music.You need to pay tickets if you want to walk on the bridge that connects the trees. Food stalls and seats are available here.It's a nice place to visit at night especially if you have a family with young children."
"Went there on December 2015.I took the shuttle to go around the place and drive me to Flower Dome and also Cloud Forest.For the flower dome, for me its just so so, not that much to see and not that special.But for the cloud forest, its quite nice, its cold but fresh.I think you need to go there if you have spare time in Singapore, but once is enough in my opinion."
"It is a big and spacious garden with a wide range of fauna. It would be nice to stroll during cool weather, either very early morning or after sunset. The two domes are just airconditioned garden with some seasonal displays. Cloud dome would offer more attraction compared to flower dome, with the waterfall, tree top walk, and river replica at the basement.The current Christmas light display isn't anything outstanding.Bring along an umbrella as it can get very hot or it rains. Again, recommended only for fauna lovers."
"Very beautiful views with interesting concepts on how nature can be moulded.Went to cloud forest first, actually amazing. They also have a section about global warming which is worth a closer look.It just gives you the facts and details about the important stuff.When i went into the flower dome place, it was underrated, compared to the cloud forest. Also do not go to the flower dome if you are Australian lol.Like 90% of the plants are Australian.But the surrounding areas of the domes are also quite well preserved."
This is a modern and futuristic variant of a botanical garden. It is very extensive and you should allow at least half a day. A number of walkways ground and aerial as well as plant specific areas inside and out. Somewhat modernistic for my taste but still worthwhile for all that.
"At the Gardens By the Bay, one could photographed the buildings of Singapore's Central Business District and of course not forgetting, the famous icon of the Marina Bay Sands. Free admission to the Garden except for the Forest and Flower Domes. There is also an open water themed area whereby kids could play among the various water features and be wet. The toilets for bath after the playtime were conveniently located close by too. During the birding season, many photographers were present there. This place is suitable for young and old."
We love to visit Botanical gardens and this one was recommended. We were disappointed that it did not meet the standards of some of the gardens in the USA and Canada.
"Coming from South Africa, we weren't overwhelmed by the gardens. The orchids are beautiful and definitely a rare sight! The maps work well and it's definitely a nice place to visit. The Satay By The Bay food court at the one end is AMAZING. we got trapped there by the rain and needed up eating so much food! It was wonderful!"
"If you are visiting flower dome, don't go in the night as the lighting is dim and you cant appreciate the flowers properly."
"Strolling around the Shoppes @ the Marina Bay Sands gives you an access through a walkway to the Gardens by the Bay. A garden with a diverse range of plant life through themed gardens. A word of advice : Your legs should hold up long distances of walking and standing.One of its key attractions is the Supertrees. If you go up the 22 meter OCBC Skyway, you'll have a bird's eye view or a vertical plant display of these trees. There's a light and sound show where the trees come to life 2x nightly around 7:45 and 8:45pm. There were kiosks and food stalls but the lines are long before you can buy food. It was quite tiring and there were plenty of people. And the light show wasn't that spectacular. It should have been more colorful and brighter. But for a first timer like us (with my 2 daughters), it was quite an experience. Something unique. I would still recommend that people visit this attraction.Next is the Flower Dome where you'll see different types of trees, floral displays and Christmas decors of all kinds which created a festive mood throughout the place.Last stop was Cloud Forest which showed a 35 meter man-made mountain and waterfalls. It was so cold inside with splashes of water going down the walkways. Didn't stay here for long as we were already tired going through the attractions for almost 4hours."
Good for family events. Make sure it is not raining when you plan to visit. Beautiful walking tracks
"Lovely and futuristic place over-staffed by a horde of 17 year old idiots whose training seems to have emphasized a) speaking incomprehensible Singlish;b) gesturing toward large EXIT signs and telling me to exit;c) playing with their smart phones;d) misunderstanding questions in several languages;e) carrying walkie-talkies around;f) checking my ticket every 3 meters all day long;g) working in pairs so that the total IQ of every pair can reach 70.the two domes are kept at low temperatures for reasons unknown. i mean 14C. i was dressed for tropical singapore, not for norway. i came down with a heavy chest cold within hours and had to visit a doctor, which cost an extra $100. nice."
Too crowded so could not really enjoy the features. The Christmas theme felt strange in 30 degree heat. Best part was an amazing thunderstorm.
A great place for flower lovers and photo taking. Christmas deco is really nice and attractive.The sky walk is an good experience.
"Architectural it is very interesting, but overall it seems very overhyped and overrated. The grounds are quite nice and lush and nicely manicured. We stood in line for 15 minutes and with a fee of $28 expected to be wowed with the two domes and felt they were rather lackluster and way overpriced. We didn't see any truly exotic flowers perhaps because they had everything setup for Xmas."
It was average!! Its more expensive for tourists. Even inside its average. Next time will prefer to sit out and see free garden.
"Not as great as expected. Unlike most other attractions of Singapore, this one falls way short. Unless you are a die hard gardener or botany enthusiast, not recommended. Unless of course you need a snap, for been there."
"The nice scene to see there , but compare to the price I may have only one time visitHowever , you can visit them once you are in Singapore"
"good place to take a photo, suggest you come at 5pm so you still can get good photo in flower doom and wait for the super tree to light up"
"On Thursday 5th November 2015, having decided to visit Gardens by the Bay in the cool of the evening, my wife and I ventured there in a taxi from our hotel. We arrived at about 7:00 p.m. and went to seek advice and directions as this was our first visit. The guy at the Information Desk seemed somewhat disinterested and unenthusiastic. In a perfunctory manner, he unfolded a map and circled the area where the Super Trees Grove was located and told us that the shows would be at 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. We enquired about the possibility of us visiting either the Flower Dome or the Cloud Forest Dome, but he discouraged us by saying that it would be too dark to see anything in the Domes and that we would require a minimum of one and a half hours to view each dome, and that it was best to view these during daylight hours. We were somewhat taken aback by his comments since the Gardens Website indicated that the closing time for the Domes was 9:00 p.m. and tickets should be purchased before 8:00 p.m., the last admission being 8:30 p.m. We expected the Domes to be floodlight at night.With the scant information and directions given, we attempted to find our way to the Grove to catch the light and music show. After groping about unsuccessfully, we followed a group of people who seemed to be headed to the Grove. We got into a lift that led to the level where the Gardens were located. Using the lit-up trees as a guide, my wife and I navigated our way to the Grove which seemed to be filling up rapidly with tourists and locals ' understandable since admission was free. Seating was rather limited and, after standing for awhile, we just sat where we could on the warm brickwork and waited about 25 minutes before the Garden Rhapsody light and music show began.The medley of music from the classics and film scores was good, and the synchronisation of the lights on the Super Trees was cleverly done. The show, which was colourful and dazzling, lasted a mere ten minutes or so. Given the hassle to get here and the time spent hanging around waiting for the show to start, we felt the short duration of the show a bit of a let-down. However, we were glad to have 'been there and done that' and to have seen what the hype was all about.When the show ended, the crowd dispersed en masse in all directions. We scouted around the Grove a bit looking for the exit that would take us to the MRT station. We followed some locals along a path that wend its way to the lift and got stuck in the queue for several minutes. There was just the solitary lift catering for a limited number of people at a time. There were no clear signs or indications of alternative ways to exit the Gardens. We eventually managed to squeeze ourselves into the lift. When we emerged at the level above, we looked around for signposts to the MRT station but, unless one had owl's eyes, these were not apparent in the dark. The signage was not lit - perhaps all the power was diverted to lighting up the Super Trees. By and by, after wandering around awhile, another tourist pointed the way to us. It turned out to be a walk along a dimly lit path which eventually took us to the MRT station."
"I am probably not the best person to recommend something this contrived. The concept claims to be ecologically sound and committed to raising awareness of climate change, but it seems to be a very elaborate and expensive way of doing it. A previous reviewer has described it as 'Disneyland for Plants', and that pretty well sums it up for me too.Thinking that I had been too harsh when I visited the project first time around in 2012, I went again this month and paid to go inside both domes. Sadly I saw little three years on to change my view.The lifts, suspended walkways and largest man made indoor waterfall are arguably great feats, as is the technology behind the artificial climates, [and the Christmas decorations are all very jolly], but a testament to Nature it is not.In my eyes it is not even close to the beauty and richness of the traditional Botanic Gardens. Go there instead'¦.you can enjoy them for free."
"The Top of the range expensive designer outlets proved to me the spending power of Singaporeans has left many of us humble UK citizens well and truly behindTypical was a ROLEX outlets selling Watches at Â£65,00$ Singapore"
"The place is very well maintained and you get a good feel once you enter the vicinity. Structures have been beautifully built and very well decorated by lights and greenery. However, the music and light show was a bit disappointing."
I was not overwhelmed by the Gardens - had expected more when i had checked the feedback. Its OK if you like to see flowers etc. In an AC controlled environment - some are good. The cloud forest is also just about OK.
"Took a shuttle to the attractions. Told it was unlimited rides. However, when we tried to get a shuttle back, there was no indication whatsoever of a shuttle stop and no one seemed to know where we could get on.Cloud forest was nice, flower dome was poorly lit and a waste of time"
Really great break from the heat as both domes are air-conned. Wide variety of plants and flowers to view. Good for a second viewing as they change the flowers often.
"Nice place and all that, but nothing that great.Take a loiter if you have nithing much to do..... the Hawker Centre nearby is great though !"
"This is a beautiful spot, but why so much more to pay for admission only forforeigners to see the gardens. This is a money gouge. Just walk around , take some pics and go somewhere else that charges the same price as residents."
"Not as i expected for Couples, but gardens made for kids if you are honeymoon couple please don't go to garden's but you can buy ticket for water falls. It's attractive big fall of water like you feels as jungle. You have big walk from down to upstairs. From marina bay sands to Gardens by the bay don't miss to walk. The tree's are so attractive from far not from near."
Its an amazing park free to walk around and see. What lets it down is the pollution evident from fires smouldering in Indonesia. Unfortunately this is becoming the norm in Singapore so it ruins the whole thing.Very accessible by train and need to spend at least 3 hours there. Platform walk excellent.
Not as impressive as was the Singapore Botanical Garden's Orchid Garden. The Flower dome building is impressive but the displays were a little underwhelming. We did not do the rain forest next door.
Gardens by the bay is pretty huge in terms of the area. You have to walk a lot to cover the whole area. The indoor gardens are the best to visit.
There are two separate domes. One has a water fall and is a climbing climactic vegetation journey. As well as wet tropical vegetation there were cacti and dry desert condition vegetation. Lots of great picture opportunities. People of all ages seemed to enjoy this dome. The second dome is definitely not as appealing to folks who like energy in the exhibit. This dome will probably appeal more to folks who botany and arboretum.Frankly the flower dome was a bit of a bust for me. The food offerings here are a bit downmarket. I would probably recommend you make lunch/dinner plans elsewhere.
"While the botanical gardens are a grande dame, it bayside cousin is a tacky, flashy, loud, obnoxious bimbo. The effort put in the reclamation project is admirable, but the loading of the gardens (which are great) with technology gimmicks spoils the overall enjoyment. Loud '80s music is piped here and there enough to be annoying, some very strange displays (such as the floating baby) makes one wonder what were they thinking.If you want to go make sure to do it directly from the MRT, if you try to reach from the bay sands you will get a major headache.Arm yourselves with patience and be aware of your surroundings as the selfie stick wielding crowd may whack you in the head in their quest for the perfect memorialization of their experience.If you visit one garden in Singapore,this should not be it. Go to the botanical gardens."
"A good place for flower and plant lovers, however very limited species of flowers. Light show in evening is very good. Too much crowd and repetitive things. Have to walk a lot. Marina Bay is nearby. Not justified for ticket price."
"The park and it's views are wonderful even though it is difficult to identify the individual collections such as the indian garden. Also plants and trees are not marked or labeled, really no information at all either outside or inside the Domes. The tickets for the two Domes are expensive and the contents is badly laid out and unexceptional. The Flower Dome mostly presenting common European flowers such as a large but uninteresting selection of Geraniums! And the Cloud Dome, well i didn't really get this at all, just a bad use of space... but better flowers than in the Flower Dome. All in all, a nice walk in the park but don't pay for anything as you will probably be disappointed... I believe the Botanical Gardens, please dont confuse the two, are much better... for my next visit"
The gardens are definitely a tourist attraction but feature many plants and flowers from around the work. Admission is fairly priced and is a good activity to pass time.
this garden looks beautiful in the night by lighting everywhere but not so great place to visit..tiring place..nothing great over there
We went during the night and the skywalk was closed. It's still pretty and busy at night with the colorful lights. A nice walk with pretty backdrops.
Went here quite a few times with friends and family. They have a lovely water and sand area for kids and its free. Plus the evening laser lights show is not to be missed and free. If I'm not wrong it is at 7pm and 8pm. Lasts abt 20 mins I think.
Everything seemed fine till we visited it. Waste of money. Those with kids must visit just for the children water play area inside the venue. Entry is free for that. Flower lovers would have a great time at the A.C. dome otherwise its pointless. Waterfall Avery entrance is attractive only. It is worth taking a snap at that point after which its boring. Kids play area is fun for children.
We visited the gardens in Oct. Sadly Singapore was covered in smoke haze from Indonesian fires and it was hot and humid but we really enjoyed the walk around the gardens. Sadly didnt get to see the conservatory as the queue to get in was so long with a couple of bus loads waiting but what we saw was great. So different... hope to go back one cooler day
"This is the place where many tourists go but as a long-term resident here, i would not recommend it to you."
Beautiful blue light Sky Tree during the UN Day celebration. Different from normal day. a lot of crowd and we need to queue very long to go up to the bridge going back to Marina Bay Sand Building. Need to have person from to control the crowd and provide direction clearly. The way back is very long as it is making a big round
Is a nice place to visit but can't stay too long due to the weather is too hot .I better is go there early the morning or after sunset. ..Actually is the best place to relax & jogging. ..got many varieties of plant & flowers. If you don't visit the Flower Dome or cloud Forest just walking around the garden is free of charge. ..
It was a nice place but nothing exciting as I don't really like flowers or garden stuff. It was also very hot and hazy when we were there.
"This is a nice place to visit with a good amount of flowers and plants. It was clean and nicely organized, however I did think it was a bit overrated. It wasn't something that I would go out of my way to do. I honestly was more impressed with the botanical gardens. But even so they do have a nice light show every night. I also enjoyed how they talked about the impacts of climate change in the cloud dome. I thought that was the best part! Otherwise it was just average nothing too special. I did go just as the sun was about to set. The place did not have lots of lighting so I recommend going a bit earlier. But do stick around for the light show. But if you're in a time crunch go to the botanical garden and skip the hefty entrance fee (28$)."
"I have reviewed the excellent Cloud Forest and the average Flower dome separately. This review covers the main gardens.Firstly, the signage is woeful and it took us ages to find the path connecting the ten or so feature gardens. From the ticketing area beside the two domes, all signs point to the domes or exits or eateries...pretty much signs to places where you will spend money. We eventually worked out that we needed to go up some concrete steps next to a gift shop and information point in order to get to the gardens. They were good, quiet and and relaxing, partly because there were very few people there no doubt because of the difficulty of finding them."
"This is one of the attractions at Gardens by the Bay, the others being the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Basically it is a bridge spanning the supertrees (towers dressed up as giant treea) A walk of about 300m tens of metres above the ground. You take a lift up giving you a good view of the gardens and the surrounding vacinity; if weather permits. Avoid Sept and October as the smoke haze from neighbouring countries blurs out everything.Entry is about SGD 5.00 More economical if you were to buy tickets for all 3 attractions. A walk around the open areas alone is worth the visit. The open areas are free of charge. Avoid noon and early afternoon as the temperature may be overwhelming for those unused to the tropical sun -33 deg C, humidity above 80%.The entire area is wheelchair friendly. Restaurants and cafes are always near."
Lots of imported plants from all over the world. It's still new and I am sure later the plants will be even better. It's like a gallery for plants.
"If are keen of photography, have kids and wanna have a family outing, this is the place. s a matter of fact, its also one of the top spots in Singapore to visit.For guys, noting much here."
"good place to spend a half day, all felt a bit artificial, if you want realistic go to the Botanical Gardens instead. But it was well organised, would not go again."
"i accompanied my cousins for sightseeing. There are various flowers at the place, but especially those are blooming in Asian Region. It's also a nice place for a nature photography, but you don't want to go far to the forested area. there is extra dmission to the cloud forest and flower dome"
This will be lovely in a few years time but at the moment on the day we went it was very hot with not much shade and not nearly enough seats to rest. We also had a long walk to the garden from Marina Bay Sands.
"I spend 2 hours at flower dome and i didnt see any interesting plants, it would be good if more variety of flora can be included here. the ones i have seen here are all very common. If you are a traveler from India visit cloud forest instead of flower dome, there isnt anything new at flower dome."
"This is an interesting garden for families, but I don't recommend it for adults. The food in the restaurants is mediocre and the gardens themselves, although much effort has gone into them and the two buildings, it is a very unusual way to present the importance of conservation."
"When we visited Gardens by the Bay we felt like we were on another planet or in a scene from Avatar. Whilst these gardens are interesting and include many attractions worth seeing, they cover a large area and spending a lot of time taking everything can make one feel tired - especially on a hot and hazy day."
"Visited the Gardens by the Bay, but was a little disappointed.A lot of walking, the Cloud was closed, so just had the Flower Dome to view."
"This site looks fantastic especially when lit up at night. There is a free garden you can visit but also the Sky Walk, Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. Be warned that on some days one or the other is closed for maintenance. So please check 1st. I'd recommend the Cloud Forest and the Sky Walk (Flower Dome disappointing)"
Pleasant area on reclaimed land to walk around. The planting is very young and the gardens should look much better in a few years time. Go if you have a couple of spare hours.
"Great human effort to reconstruct various fauna but nothing as such that may qualify it as the Must-be-done list while visiting Singapore. If you have spare time, spending an evening here might be considered. Has a good ambience and a nice track by the bay side. There's a good play area for the infants further inside that the kids can have a great time at."
Great place to visit with family & kids. it might not really suitable for young groups as it's just all about plants and flowers. Avoid to visit at noon because it will be very hot. Best time during 4/5pm then you can see beautiful lights turn on at about 6.30pm.
"Is a spacious space. U can visit the 2 domes for a package price. Great for people who like flowers. If you take the hi tea inside the flower dome, you can have hi tea and enjoy admission to the flower dome as well if u do not want to visit the other dome where there is the man made water fall. Great place for families where there is ample space to walk around. And there's always different themes in the flower dome."
"Nice place to spend some extra time, if you have. Certain attractions are paid here but we did not try them. Visiting this place was an afterthought for us as we had time on hand. We roamed around the garden which had some nice sculptures and there was a light show around 7PM. Please check out the time when you visit. Beyond that, I did not fancy much here. But then, I am not a person who enjoys quiet places much, so you may have a different experience. Its close to the Marina Bay, which was much more fun for me."
We bought a day pass which included a boat ride and several stops to popular tourist attractions and this is one of them. It is indoor and has many great photo opportunities if you can withstand crowds of people walking in front of you. It was beautiful but only went because it was included.
I visited whilst I had some time over the weekend. It was nice laid out in both domes. The mountain dome is by far the best. For $28 its worth a visit
Structurally amazing.. but a bit disappointed in the flower dome as most of the flowers were just in the pots (arranged beautifully tho) and have not seen any butterflies - i would have thought there must have some sort of natural balance in the dome. Overall a nice experience
"We only opted to do the skywalk within the park and the views are amazing. But be prepared if you are afraid of heights the you can see through the floor and the spans do shake and move slightly as people walk across. From the vantage point you and overlook the park and have great views of the Sands by the Bay Hotel. Unfortunately, the visibility is hampered by smoke from Indonesian fires and forecast to be an issues through October 2015."
"Easy to get to using MRT and a number of other venues in close proximity, Bay Sands Shopping and Casino, Arts and Science Museum. A good walking area but having lived in the Far East there wasnt anything new here. If its your first Far East visit then its a good venue to learn and see the fauna up close. The Flower dome was closed and it was pretty smoggy from the forest burning in Indonesia (which you could smell) no good city views due to the haze. The night time walk is a lot better and cooler. If its quiet then you will also get to see a number of lizards and even the odd sleeping gardener."
"The sky walk was closed because of a threatening thunderstorm. The cloud forest was nicely done. This is of interest when one has not visited different parts of the world to experience the real thing, otherwise it is an artificial contrived experience."
"Great place to have a city escape. Fresh and peace in the morning, and beautiful with light in the night."
"Not much to see, but cool environment and nice view. I could go for both flower and cloud dome, which were basically the same excpet for the part where they have a giant artificial mountain in the middle with waterfall.Place itself was quite unique"
"At first impression you will feel like its awesome, but when you see the show, its not that good. Yes, you can watch it for once if you are a first time visitor. But I would not recommend a second time"
"Beautiful, but expensive if you want to visit the conservatories. The free access areas are pretty cool, especially at night. If interested in nature, a trip to the botanical gardens might be the way to go."
"It was very pretty, especially the light show during the evening. But I think this is a bit overrated as tourist attraction. I preferred the other visits we have done in Singapore (Pulau Ubin for example) over this."
"For gardens and flora, I actually preferred the Botanical Gardens from a previous visit. However, Gardens by The Bay in the evenings, makes for amazing night photos, especially with the Super Trees and Singapore Flyer in the background.The grounds of the Gardens are FREE, and there is a nightly light and music show, which is ok. It felt a little like a Disneyland themed ride. There are 2 showings/night. I saw the @7:45pm showing and then went to the Fullerton to watch the Marina Bay Sands light show @9:30pm. If you can only see 1 light show, see the Marina Bay Sands one.I enjoyed the night photography though at Gardens by The Bay. And, I can see how it would be romantic to stroll around in the evenings. :)"
"when looking up what to do in Singapore, everyone had been talking about the ""Gardens by the Bay"" which was supposed to be very nice so I decided to check it out. The gardens are free to visit and are spread over a large area so provide some tranquility and peace in a bustling city. There are Towers in the middle of the garden which you can climb to see a panoramic view of the city. This does have a fee - the fee is modest but then again so is the path. The path is extremely short and only takes about 5-10 minutes to cross as it only connects between two towers, even though there are about 10 towers in the park. Had the path connected to more Towers, it would have been more interesting but the short path made you question whether it was really worth it.The gardens were nice though and provided a nice quite stroll in the busy city."
I love walking around the Garden and saw great floral collection. The architectural aspect of the whole garden is simply breathtaking.A landmark worth 5 hours of visiting.
"It's an integrated garden. While some local would find it boring, I find it interesting as I walk around and learn new species of plants and trees. A night stroll would be perfect. Not forgetting it's nearby Satay by the Bay and further up to Marina Barrage."
The gardens by the bay complex is a nice place to take a little stroll and have a bite.If you go after dark there is a musical show including the giant trees. The show is half an hour long and is 2 times a day.
"I have had the pleasure of being here twice now, and I must admit that this second time round, I was a bit underwhelmed.The Gardens are showing a little sign of wear and tear, but the concept remains a good one. There is plenty to see and do, but rather than being the treasure they set out to be, they are increasingly becoming more and more commercial-more like a theme park than a genuine attraction.That being said, if you like ritzy lights with electone style music, the LED display at night is certainly worth the effort.At the time of this visit, there was a lot of construction work happening and this level of intrusion did impact on the pleasure of the trip around the gardens.I noticed the almost doubling in prices on a couple of the entry prices over the past couple of years.Still worth the visit, and as the locals tend to say, best seen at night."
"Went in a group of 7 adults and a kid to the paid flower dome and cloud forest. Generally interesting and something different to experience. When asked around if anyone would visit again, less than half of us said yes, and others said once is enough. Obviously the ones who said yes are gardening enthusiasts. The rest of us were kinda waiting for them to explore the whole place and waiting to go. Beautiful plants and flowers make the place a pleasure to experience."
beautiful species of trees and plants in the park. walking on the bridge is quite scary and recommended only for adults without vertigo.
We had to duck in here due to a storm but we were always intending to visit. It was good bang for buck for a pretty unique experience with the waterfall and garden at the peak. Didnt visit the other attractions there but the outdoor sky walk looks ok too.
I think it was average if you are staying at Marina Bay Sands. You can stay in the comfort of your room and enjoy all the lights. I didn't find it to be a shout about I guess because I could see it from my balcony
"These gardens are nowhere near as good as the Botanical Gardens. It was more akin to a Disneyland setting with stone animals, chunks of rock and little to see in the way of plants. We did not go into the conservatories as quite a high charge was made. You even had to pay to walk on the elevated walkway. Nothing very natural here. Would not go back."
The gardens are closed 2 days each month for maintenance. Unluckily these were the two days we were iN Singapore
"Heard a lot about this place but I was disappointed and bored. My plan was to spend whole evening there n see the light sound show but couldn't wait there long and moved to watch laser show, at walking distance at sands by the bay. 1 hr is more than enough n going late in the evening would be a good idea. Laser show was awesome at marina bay"
"Variety of plants brought in from across the globe. The colourful display of flowering plants can be pleasing to the eyes. However it's chaotic arrangement without due consideration of the plant classification is very disappointing. The concept of bringing into one roof is there but we think it's more of the aesthetic sense the flower garden was made of. They haven't achieved and maximised the potential of each plant needs as to eg., full or partial sun requirement. Although the environment in the house is controlled there's a lot that needs to be done which could maximised the plants growing conditions. For example, in the cactus section we noted a few turning into yellowish - this should be thrown to the skip. The trees next to the cacti section do not look happy - could be dehydrated. Overall a good place to wonder around while in Singapore."
"There is no doubt, Gardens by the Bay is the main attraction of Singapore especially the area of the supertree grove. I never though these man made trees were so gigantic. visit before sunset to enjoy the full light and music show (daily around 7.45pm)."
"We visited the Garden by the Bay in the evening.As Singapore was celebrating its 50th national anniversary (National Day: 9th August), Garden by the Bay had a spectacular display called Garden Rhapsody, where artificial trees, called Supertrees, would light up and 'dance' to Singaporean national songs.The songs were interesting and aroused the spirit of Singaporeans. To foreign visitors, these songs were also a way to help them appreciate Singaporeans' patriotism.However I was disappointed by a lack of signposts, and I found the layout of the garden very confusing. We were disorientated at the gardens. Furthermore, there was a long queue for the lift, and many people were as confused as we were."
"This place is both intriguing and a bit creepy. Sort of reminds me what the future Earth could look like if we're not careful. The structures are beautiful, especially lit up at night. A little too overrun with tourists for my liking."
It was a very very big garden. Nicely done. I just got couple hours there and it was not enough!Would like to revisit next time.
"Good to come here if you are having kids, and want to avoid the heat.The paid-entrance of flower dome and cloud forest is with heavy air-conditioning, you will almost feel too cold in there."
"The variety of flora and fauna is substantial and well classified for a very educational experience. Indoor air-conditioning is very comfortable to keep out the tropical heat. However, it still feel somewhat very commercialized and artificial, like the most of the attractions in Singapore."
"had to keep reminding ourselves it is a botanical gardens. its pitched as something more, i don't know, exciting, but its really just a park. everything you do bar the walking costs extra! and its pretty busy, although expensive. very well done though"
"Is a very nice place, the feeling is that we are getting ready to leave in a new artifical world. They recreate the desert, the Mediterranean climate and the waterfalls! Is incredible..but be aware is very cold inside!!!! And nothing you can't see walking around in the beautiful free gardens outside!"
way overhyped. i was expecting much more but it was really only a building that lit up at night. not that impressive
Gardens by the bay are the new monumental attraction in Singapore but only the Cloud forest worths the visit. At the end of the day ticket is overpriced and too much crowd.
"Nice place to come with family. But not too recommended if you're a backpacker with a tight budget. I mean, the place is cool, the architecture and so on. But then, with SGD $20-ish you can enjoy something else rather than those colorful flowers."
Well good place to spend time at.View of Singapore and Marina Bay is good.Should be more conveniently planned - there is too much to walk
"100 artificial, air conditioned. Singapore does not have much to appeal to tourists except cleanness and tidiness. Everything is orderly and being managed. This garden is a collection of plants from various parts of the world. Yes, educational if you bring your kids or calming down yourself after exciting moments in the casino."
"My parents and I were going to end our last night in Singapore by Marina Bay Sands so we decided to just stop by the Gardens by the Bay area. It's really nice they offer the shuttle service.The outdoor area is nice to just walk around but unless you love gardens and flowers, I think the gardens were overpriced. And the supertrees walkway is also overpriced. If you're going to pay $23 SG or more, you might as well go up to Marina Bay and buy a $16 SG drink then you can see the view. Or you can pay $23 on the observation deck and see the light show.But otherwise if you have time it's nice to just relax by the gardens and it's well-connected to Marina Bay."
"It is all about marketing. since I hail from Bangalore our Lalbagh scores hands down, but alas our tourism department hasn't done much about this as to what Singapore has done with an artificial garden created on reclaimed land."
Great place for a leisurly stroll & a cool down. Best to avoid busy periods (probably midday?) when it can get quite hectic and noisy
The cloud forest was nice but getting from one skyway to another seems tricky. There was a lift that's specially reserved for wheelchair and pram users but other guests still use it. Security guard saw but acted blur and walked away. Beautiful flowers at flower dome but nothing really exceptional. Nice 2h Sunday outing for family.
"Got there in the evening. They are OK gardens. Just like most of Singapore, a bit too neat and crowded."
we have visited the two domes . only nice in cloud forest is the artificial falls. flowers are so ordinary . i felt so bored after walking around. even food choices is not so great. we tried the satay by the bay. nothing special.
An average place to enjoy. flower garden is less than average compare to similar in many other cities in the world. forest side is much better.
Very cool but crowded beyond belief. If you have the chance to see the gardens from the MBS then I would recommend that over actually going to the Gardens.
"Just a few hints here. Be careful of the double pricing policy here and read the small print.If you are non Singaporean you are not allowed to buy tickets for only one gallery, you have to pay for two, whereas Singaporeans can pay for one or two galleries.If you are a Singaporean OAP (above 60) then there is substantial discount. If you are a foreign OAP then TOUGH, there is no discount!There is no discrimination for waking around the outside gardens. Free for one and all.Come to your own conclusion."
"We visited the gardens, looking forward to a magical evening after reading reviews about the Gardens and the night time spectacular.The waiting time to get up onto the skywalk was over an hour ... So we decided not to do that, but rather to sit and enjoy the show. We waited, and waited. About 15 min after the show was due to start, an announcement was made that due to technical issues, there would be no show that evening. Disappointing!The gardens are beautifully completed and provide a tranquil oasis in the middle of the city ... However, they didn't live up to the promise of spectacular.Advice - go early to get tickets, and cross your fingers for all to go smoothly"
A lot of marvellous man made sights but oh so crowded. This is a great spot to check out but be prepared to have to deal with crowds and long lines.
"Beautiful either in daylight or even on the evening.. u can see many different plants, beautiful lights cover all the place on the evening creating a romantic ambience"
Didn't have time to go to the domes. Walked around the rest of the gardens. Only had to pay to visit the domes. Pretty nice. Worth a visit. Parts of the park reminded me of the movie Avator.
Too much concentration with not enough explanation. Memorable displays but we would have liked more information about the individual specimens
Thanks to the shuttle bus to garden by the bay at 2 dollars per pax one need not walk so far to the destination.but the admission fees to flowe dome n cloud forest is too expensive.i paid 20 for myself n 28 each for my handicapped sis in law n elderly mum in law who came fr hongkong.honestly she asked me one question why did the disabled and elderly must pay so much?? Shouldnt they be given discounted tickets since they are weak n jobless? I m dumb founded.the flower dome has two storeys and the cactus exhibition was quite boring but luckily we have sg50 celebration that show case different types of orchids fr spore the cloud forest was awe catching due to the manmade water fall...the sky walk was great foylr youngster and kids but not for the weak and faint hearted...overall i would say for that price i would rather go to others scenic places in spore.
"When you reach gardens by the bay at night, don't forget to watch the show calls ""Garden Rhapsody"" 7:45pm & 8:45pm everynight. Both the park entrance and show are FOC."
"It's just too neat for me (for a garden), and nothing really special. All you can hear are only the sounds of electrical generator or exhaust system rather than frogs, birds or insects.But it's a well-designed artificial themed gardens and it's quite pretty at night with all the lighting and stuff. You can find some rare massive sea creatures in a tank in one of its garden.Also there are a floral/unique plants attractions called 'Flower Dome' & 'Cloud Forest' but you need to buy tickets to get in."
I spent a few hours here. It is a pleasant place to spend some time. The gardens are well laid out and organized. I would recommend going in the cooler hours of the day.
"I been there on Jun 2015 and I bought ticket fee from People Park Tower ( China Town Area). Nothing special for us. Just many kind of flower & Tree. If you like or love Natural you come to visit here you'll happy. For me, I think lose the money. Cheer"
"There is no doubt this is an amazing place, though ticketing is confusing because there are 3 different ticketing offices for different things. You get to one office and they tell you to walk 15 minutes to another to buy a ticket. Annoying."
"This greenspace are the embodiment of the the vision of 'City within a garden'. Like most things inthe city, it's neat and well tended.However, it is also rather expensive for a public space. Admission to the domes were SD$14.00 each ( Cloud dome was closed for maitenance). Ticketing for garden tours and shuttle was confusing and disjointed."
"This place is very good if your into looking at plants, grasses and trees. It has a few kids sort of places that feature animals etc made from flowers."
It's a garden composed of 2 domes: One has plants from all over the world that were stuffed in an air conditioned dome and the other has mountain flora with mist and condensation all over the place.
"The amazing thing here are not the gardens (which are very impressive). The amazing thing is the controlled environment inside of giant domes. It all feels a little fake, complete with music playing from fairytales and effigies of cows and ducks. Oh and don't touch the plants, feeling is not part of the experience. Tiered pricing for locals, tourists pay more."
"In spite of all the hype, I would only visit once unless I'm bringing out-of-town visitors around Singapore. I can't imagine Singaporeans going repeatedly to the Gardens. First of all, the entrance fee is heavy, especially for foreigners. Next, there is little of the naturalness found in the Botanic Gardens, every bush and shrub is cultivated and not allowed to proliferate naturally, and it looks it. The Cloud forest with the cascading waterfalls and mist is indeed a novelty but it isn't very safe for the elderly or wheelchair-bound. The floorboards are perpetually wet from the spray and you have to keep going up and round to quite great heights, all very picturesque but you wouldn't want to do it more than once.Then, the plants cultivated in the various enclosures (and you must pay again for some) can be seen in their native lands - Australia, Japan or Europe in greater glory and variety.Lastly, reasonably-priced food is difficult to find. 'L'indochine' with its fine views is best visited at night, the lunch we had was expensive and did not even taste fresh while 'Pollen' for some inexplicable reason was closed while the local food were more expensive versions of those found elsewhere in Singapore.At night though, it's beautifully lit up, but then you can get a stunning view as you ride in the bus over Benjamin Sheares Bridge."
This place lacks a natural feel and everything is man made. Many flowers and plants are imported from other countriesIt is also very crowded packed with full of tourists. Not really recommended
"Not impressed, you're better off going to the Singapore Botanical to view flora. I enjoyed the gardens better viewing it from across the water from above on the Singapore Flyer. The place looks magical in the evening when the garden is lit up.Get 2 for the price on 1 by going to the Flyer in the evening and get treated to a beautiful lighted garden by the bay across the way."
Ok to drop by and see the lights but not worth making a deliberate trip there. Expect a lot of walking thus best done in late afternoon when the sun is not too harsh. I had issues flagging a cab... but the paid attractions are quite nice really.
"Very pretty and beautiful, just a lot of walking, you have to walk through the Sands first, then walk and walk more..."
You can visit the park for free but you need to pay to go into the glass domes which is highly recommended.. Also you can pay a small amount to go up onto the skybridge - its also worth doing. So if you want to spend a few hours away from it all in a large city this is the place for you.
"It's very unrealistic and everything cry out there, that it's man creature. I felt it's very unnatural, probably, good to have wedding shoot there or theme play. The only good thing is that you get to see MBS from different angle"
wonderful scenery especially at night. there are some concerts occasionally so do check out their website.
Nothing much here just for viewing n enjoy the ambience..stay outdoors..Tixs to e plces of interest quite expensive though..
It's a novel idea and i think they have executed well. It's worth a visit if you are into flaura and fauna.
"It is a nice set up for sure , a good mixture of man-made architectures and nature.But the only way out is horrible . One small lift to exit the place and it gets horrible long queue at peak hours/ season.I would steer away from it at peak season."
"There are 2 domes of the place; clouds forest and flower dome. In the cloud forest, there are around 7 storeys of forest with a big waterfall. Theres a signpost to guide you to walk in a designated way. Its really cold and refreshing inside - a good escape from the freakin hot weather outdoor! Then theres a flowerdome which has several kinds of plants and flowers catergorized in a theme - cactus zone, mediteranean, and an exhibition zone. You can go there by MRT Bayfront station and follow the sign ""gardens by the bay"" you will reach the ticket statio. Where u can buy the shuttle bus to the dome round trip for SGD2 (or u can choose to walk-quite a distance+the heat. The outside garden is free."
"i think they should have travelator to take people around the place. the kids get tired, so we're not going to children garden as our plan before"
That it a so good and place let the viewer go to visit. The environment is also very good and the scenery is beautiful. It feels very comfortable here
"Went here with my parents at night to view the scenery, there is a fee if you are going into the domes or towers. It is a lovely place but quite stuffy if it is not windy. Taking pictures and visiting the different areas of flowers is a fun time and experience with family."
"Gardens By The Bay is promoted as the latest icon of Singapore. But honestly, it's just a big garden which not much special. Just keep charging garden by garden. If you really want to have a look of the park. Just go there without paying for any garden."
"Big spacious garden, there was a lot of people having picnics in various part of the garden. Not a lot of things to see but interesting. It's also walking distance to the Marina Bay sands."
it is not worth paying 25$ for the entry ...garden looks beautiful in the night...inside it nothing attractive......................................................................................................
It was unique but disappointing as the ambience was not natural eventhough there were different varieties of plants and flowers.
"Make the walk to the Meadow and then cross the Gardens to take the overpass through the impressive Sands Hotel and then continue to Sands Marina! - At night free light show, very well made."
"good points: there was a bridge connected the Garden to the Marina Bay Sands and it opened for visitors. The light show of the Garden was magnificent. It was a suitable place for gathering.disadvantage: few lights at night, so the visitors may get lost within the garden area"
Still a bit raw and surrounding properties are building sites however very clearly it will be quite fabulous by say 2020Public transport options within this huge park lack logic and dining options limited. The satay area sounds great in concept but is un inviting and lacks atmosphere
"Nice to see, but would not come twice. The main attraction is a round tower made of concrete and covered all round with greenery ... was supposed to be flowers but not many were actually blossoming. Walking around the tower at various floor levels is supposed to illustrate various levels of a rain forest. Good idea, however lagging execution."
"The whole garden area feels very manufactured like a theme park although it was nice to wander along the tree lined paths. If you had to chose between this & the Botanical Gardens, the Botanical Gardens would win hands down - 10 times better.The super trees are interesting & make for some great photos - feels very Avatar.The Cloud Forest is worth paying to go in ($16) & experience however I personally found the Flower Dome disappointing & not worth the extra $12 (it's $16 for one dome, $28 for both). There's not a lot of flora - nothing unique anyway & it all felt very manufactured."
"There are too many artificial displays. It is neither an entertainment garden, nor an educational garden."
"Gardens by the bay is a surreal and beautiful man made garden with sky walks and even a night time show.We went to the gardens twice while in singapore -1st time during the heat of the day as a stop off on another tour, the gardens are very expansive, you need a min of 3 hours to see it all, we only had 40 mins to rush around.Our second visit to the gardens by the bay was during the evening on our own time to hit up the Super Tree Rhapsody light show we had heard so much about. It was definitely aimed at the kids whith all the lights blinking to the beat of the entire catalogue of the Disney movie soundtrack collection. Still impressive to adults none the less. Well worth a visit.What i found most interesting is that the super trees are not just these colossal structures that look good, they actually have a purpose, one is a restaurant, some are chimneys, others are exhausts and each and every single one of them is a solar power conductor. Pretty cool!Also, if you do pay to go up on the sky walk where you can walk amongst thse big pretty structures, you can get some great shots of the city, the Marina Bay Sands and the High Flyer.Of all the things to do in Singapore this is definitely more on the touristy side but still worth the trip."
It's an innovation where a controlled environment hosts a wide variety of flora. The Cloud Forest is very nice with the waterfall as its primary feature. Takes a couple of hours to complete now but is developing continuously.
So the garden itself is fine. I liked that it is free and an unusual big part which seems like a place to relax and enjoy the nature. It does not behave like a botanical garden so I liked it pretty much. The place is well maintained and there are very less people around. Facilities are good and.It really get as you the feeling that you are out of town!
nice place but worth a short visit. Cloud forest is very good. The flower dome was kinda of okay. The trees also okay. There are better places to cover in singapore if you are on a short stay.
"This is the place to go if you love nature or an outdoor person, somehow, I find that when you reach the place, one feels close to nature, the flowers, the trees - it have a calming effect. Although there is a queue, you not have to wait long for your turn. Be prepared to walk and take in all the sights of nature at it's best. There are some plants which are dying and in bad shape though, but not sure if it's due to visitors that allow their small kids to pluck and destroy the plants and flowers. Be ready to snap at every corner......"
"They have 2 doom, one doom full of flower and unique plant. the other one is like a falling water where you can feel the cloud.i prefer to choose the cloud doom because it more unique and modern attractive. but you can also walk around the doom for free."
It was ok. Visited in the evening for the light show. The nearest MRT is Bayfront and 7 mins walk to the garden
"i think its more beautiful at night, if you go at noon try to catch audio tour.bring umbrella because it might rain."
"I guess its good if you bring your kids along. But going there with friends my age, there was nothing memorable. And I think its better if you visit early in the morning or late afternoon. We visited around 2pm (very bad timing I know!) and it was scorching hot. I was under the impression that since its a garden it will be nice and cool, but its still hot. And there was nothing special to see as well."
"Went there between 2 to 5 pm and it was really hot. Would have after 5 pm and enjoy the lighting except for a dinner engagement that night. For a park, there were many trees etc but the huge structures in the park were a bit daunting and overshadowed the real plants.The garden grounds are free on entry but they charge a standard adult admission fee of SGD28 for two conservatories (air-conditioned). But local residents get a choice of visiting one conservatory (SGD12) or two (SGD20); senior locals get to pay SGD 8 and 15 respectively. Locals may welcome this differentiation but tourists may find them being discriminated against.I saw near the entrance a photo with lotus flowers. When I asked for information at the Visitors Information, I was given wrong information because their direction would make me retrace my steps and I did not see any lotus ponds on the way to the Visitors Information Centre. I had to check again outside and found that there was a small pond in the opposite direction. The guys there were happy to be renting audio sets but did not bother to really know their Gardens by the Bay."
The light and sound show there in the evening was not that great. The gardens there are huge with a good collection of flowers but the place does not feel romantic.
I did not find this to be nearly as attractive or interesting as the Botanical Gardens but a lot more touristy. Perhaps most interesting in terms of the surrounding architecture.
"Hi,When I was in Singapore I had a few hours to kill before my flight back, and decided to go to the Gardens By The Bay. It is pretty nice, very clean and organized... But a but too artificial for my taste"
"erh...the pros: perfectly clean, nice, well organized....you can tell it is well kept, good management.cons: too well kept.after all it is a great place for family and kids, or even for couples who are taking couple/wedding pictures...."
"The month visited is Tulipmania theme - also fairy tales theme. I saw a lot of different breeds of tulips and I got to know that you can easily see tulips in all seasons. Very colorful bouquet, carving on trunks, varieties of flowers and plants, cactuses, air plants and so on.I personally feel the low budget fairy tales decoration is quite pathetic. The little red hood is so scary standing at the corner and not seeing her face. Rapunzel not facing us at her tower with her long hair falling down, it's another scary princess. One more princess cover up with a masque, tall, I couldn't tell who is she from the head to toe. No mood for me to take photos for memories. Haha gosh! Hope the management can improve this further more. I've included the little red hood photo.Perhaps this is the bad time and bad season I visit? I came across photos on Google there are so beautiful and fun especially during the Easter and Christmas. Will come again next time.Other than that, rain forest water fall is awesome. Beautiful scene and rainbow from the fall. We have fun taking photos around and bridge walk is quite short and easy to walk. Evening is even nicer to walk around outside the dome. Sunset is beautiful."
"Its avg, but big hoo ha in Sg when there are tuplips. Well, may appear to south east asia tourist but europeans may not deem fantastic as europe has beautiful flowers everywhere"
"Big Structure Garden, found that the flowers were too far apart, mostly way hot along the way. Nice structural flower but again not real plants. Flowers in the Doom not impressive, more flowers could be planted. The rainforest flowers doesn't seem to guide or educate much, mostly felt mist only.Long walks to get there, folks has to be prepared for long walks, otherwise, get some form of wheelchair would be best. Children prepare prams. Overall good, more rooms to improve in terms of flows."
"It was nice experience for a change to beat the heat of Singapore, and see number of flowers and nicely maintained place with lots of greenery. .."
"Plastic fantastic, botanical buildinginteresting floral varieties but the overall experience felt a little too artificial to me."
Good service. Located in the Atrium but at one end so not a lot of passing people. Only problem is that serve the cheaper cuts of meat to start with and leave the best till last.
To go on the sky walk you had to pay and to go into the flower domes you had to pay but the rest of the gardens were free which was nice.
"Nice park, but not worth the trip. It's a good 20-30 minute walk from Bayfront MRT/Marina Bay Sands. The free areas before the paid entry domes have a lot to offer, but there isn't much signage to describe what flowers and trees you're looking at. The domes can be cleared in less than an hour."
"I visited the Gardens at night so there was not much to see. But I guess if you visit the Gardens in the afternoon, it will be too hot"
"The Lotus exhibition was pretentious and a little anti-climactic, the theme was children's stories.The rainforest was much better, the skywalk is great for those who are thrilled at walking on high platforms, with a see-through foot platform."
The engineering of this place and will amaze gentlemem it amazed me. As for the flowers hear there was nothing that I have not seen hear in the UK. They were very into tulips at this time of year which we also have plenty of. The gift shop was expensive
"My friend was impressed from photos with the lights from the outside and wanted to do this attraction when she came over for a visit. She was told to do it at night to watch the 'lighting' within. So, we toured Marina Bay Sands Hotel and waited for dusk.Around 6 pm, we walked over and purchased the tickets; where 'Tulipmania' is on right through May. A lot of tulips were flown in from Holland for display. I was expecting vibrant colourful of tulips on display. A disappointment. The lights were dim, and only certain corners have bright lights shining down. There were figurines and building structures to give the somewhat boring display a lift. Within half an hour, we were out.At the purchasing booth, luckily we were informed about the daily evening 'Light Rhapsody' shows at the Supertree Grove at 7.45pm and 8.45pm apart. We rushed over and reached just in time for the free show to start. I watched the lights laying on my back, following the music. It's something, but it could be better. Fortunately, no rain. The whole area has no shelter."
The dome are really nice.. But highly crowded.Tree walk is second best attraction. Overall good place.
"After alight at Bay front MRT station, we need to walk about 15-20mins to the ticketing areaIf you happen to have NTUC linkcard which will have 10% discount or OCBC Credit card with 15%We brought the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest ticket. And it's pretty crowded as we went during the Chinese New Year period.One of the attraction of the Cloud forest will be the Manmade Waterfall and the Cloud Walk.I got giddy when I try walking down the Cloud walk from the topSo most of the journey is rushing down instead of enjoying.For the Flower Dome, it caster with a lot of variety of flower species and it's smell goodThe place wasn't that big compare with the Cloud forest but definitely look more lively with the vibrant color of the flowerOne setback is that the Themed area which is not so accessible for those that are wheel bound due to one entry. Perhaps if it's not so crowded, it should be fine I believe. Overall still enjoyable with the cooling environmentIf you are bringing young kid, best to have stroller with you"
We checked out the gardens after seeing Marina Bay Sands. These gardens are definitely unique. We tried to get back there at night time as there is a light show but didnt make it
Good enough to spend a few hours and definitely worth a trip. Indian and Chinese gardens were nothing great. Eateries were a bit pricy.
We went here during the evening; I guess it would be more fun if we have visited Gardens by the Bay during the day; we could have appreciated the surroundings more.
"I went there at about 9.30pm, so there really was nothing to see other than the lighted super trees. I wish I had gone in the morning, because there were so many different gardens available. Unfortunately, I'd have to say going at night is pretty much a waste of time. Unless you don't mind walking around aimlessly for 15 minutes staring at the undeniably beautiful man-made tree structures and then go home. Don't get me wrong, it was pretty, but I wouldn't want to go again at night.PS. You have to charge to enter some areas, but the main areas including the lighted trees are free."
"Took a walk in the gardens after a concert at Marina Bay Sands.The Gardens is free admission, but there are many other attractions which are chargeable.There may be more to see in the day but we enjoyed the night air and the beautiful lights.The view from the bridge overlooking the Dragonfly and Kingfisher lakes is breathtaking. From here you can also see the beautiful Marina Bay Sands Hotel Skyline in the night lights.At the SuperTree Grove there are unique trees of up to 16 storeys in height with amazing light displays which I understand runs on solar energy.Overall, a nice relaxing walk in the night."
"Unique looking garden complex built in front of the marina bay sands hotel. The majority of the gardens which seem to combine natural and artificial elements is free to explore, and there is several domes (cloud and flower) and a skywalk which are apparently quite good however quite expensive. I went during the day and it was hot and humid and if I had my time again would go late afternoon/early evening to miss the heat of the day and also see the light show. Very easy to visit if you are walking around the marina area."
The Geardens themselves were quite nice but not in the same league as the Botanical Gardens. However they contained wonderful places like The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest which are 'must-sees'
"This is the only place I've travelled too where I felt I was a nuisance because I am disabled.The ticket seller didn't want us to go in to the indoor attractions, with my small travelscoot., mobility aid. After a long queue he sent us off somewhere to get permission to enter. We did get permission and again joined the queue.Unbelievably he refused to believe us ! and phoned himself to check - effectively calling us a liar.It was very embarrassing, and when we tried to complain we were just given 'shrugs.'I've noticed Singapore seems to have a policy of making young college graduates Managers- maybe because of their language skills. They are not generally equipped to deal with customer service. This is a truly beautiful addition to Singapore's tourism, but my treatment there reduced me to tears twice, it was so disappointing. The plants, exhibits, light show, everything were great. If only they could treat disabled visitors with more respect."
So we spent the day wandering around the gardens and went into both conservatories. As a tourist to Singapore you have to purchase a ticket that covers you for both conservatories. If you have flown with Singapore airlines you can show them your boarding card for 10% off. There is also a charge for the walkway between the supertrees but the rest of the gardens are free. Recommend wearing comfortable footwear. It was very interesting to learn about the purpose of the supertrees - they are not just for show but I won't spoil it for you.The new Tulipmania was a big let down. There were actually not that many tulips and it was interwoven with fairy tales which made it seem very tacky and over the top. The rest of the gardens get a five from me though.There is plenty of information signs on the various aspects of the gardens and the features in them. Close to the bayfront MRT and Marina Bay Sands for some food or a cool off. Satay by the Bay is an eating area and I highly recommend the Turkish stand. The food was incredible especially the Pide.Overall worth a vist. You can spend as much or as little time here as you want. Would recommend the conservatories but do not miss the cloud forest! That for me was the highlight.
I went here during noon at it was a really bad idea. I wish I went at night when there's a light show and also the temperature isn't that hot.
Brought my kids down for scootering n water play at their rather large outdoor play area.We've been around the inside of the air conditioned gardens as well as the top of those 'trees'.The play areas are worth revisiting.
"I went with two other friends to this place. My first time here. The flowers itself are beautiful but I find it a bit too humid for my liking. We end up sitting down in the restaurant in the garden sipping beverages and eating tapas longer than admiring the flowers. Air was just too humid. It's the way they maintain the flowers I know but still, we didn't like the humidity."
"I say this mostly because while the structures were unique, I found nothing about them compelling enough to assuage my overwhelming feelings that this was a Disney type experience catering to youngsters (of which I am not nor do I have any). Adults with high IQs might better spend their time in the Art Museum or Museum of History or the Botanic Gardens. This was a ""Should Have Skipped"" for me."
"good for kids and Chinese;) too artificial for my taste, but still amazing to see (once). impressing in size and strange architecture , but disappointing elsewhere. a kind of plant disneyland."
"We have read most of the reports about this place. But were rather disappointed by what we saw. We can truly understand what Gardens by the Bay is all about, but. We found this attraction lacking in natural appeal, I was disappointed to see 'Lego' flowers and a lot of plastic and polished glass with the living stones. It is a great attraction for people with mobility problems, but if you want to experience a natural gardens and flowers go to the Botanical gardens or the Orchid Gardens."
Very well buit up and nicely structure botanical garden and nicely lite up in the evening and variety of flora and fauna found is excellent
"Its more hype than the actual place. We have better gardens in India. It was just manicured pedicured and clinically clean gardens. Nothing like true nature. Everything is paid for. For those who like clean mud, this is the place"
"It's not everyday that you get to see these architectural wonders of the super grooves. However, being subdued to the harsh hot and humid weather while trying to do that could be a big ask especially if you are travelling with little ones.Otherwise, probably worth it. It's free unless you want to take a walk high up in the bridges connecting the super grooves."
"We decided to visit when darkness came as we had been told it's very picturesque at night, we were not disappointed.We only visited the light show as we were on a budget so I cannot comment on anything but this area.Light show was really pretty, got some great pictures and nice to chill out for abit in the garden."
"Beautiful but not natural , a kind of building rather than garden. It seems to show in night time but we miss it"
Like everything else in SG this garden is also man made. Suggest to come at night to see the lights. Can get really humid and hot during late afternoon.
"We did not visit the greenhouses. A great deal of thought has gone in to planning the gardens, but unless you are interested in horticulture they are still somewhat boring during the day. Having said that, the trees look spectacular when lit up at night and the view of these from the top of Marina Bay Sands is beautiful (don't pay the entrance fee, go to Ku De Ta bar before 9pm and see it for free)."
I am a real garden lover and have been to many of the top gardens around the world. These gardens don't come close to some of the other top gardens such as Longwood. Only worth going if you are directly in the area.
The Gardens By The Bay are a true singapore experience. Once I got over the moral implications and the overwhelming amount of money and resources it would have taken to first dig this lands out of the sea then find all the plants and animals to put in this garden I appreciated the place. But it feels a bit artificial and thats not really my cup of tea.
"The Gardens By The Bay are the most manicured gardens I have ever visited - not a leaf out of place! This gives the Gardens a slightly surreal feel, but they are a lovely haven and a good place to take kids as there is a lot to do."
"Gardens by Bay are very impressive, particularly at night under lights ! You must remember, though - it's Singapore. There's not much else to see if you've travelled extensively. There's lots of places to go out and party (they are expensive), however during the day if you are not into shopping at normal (think your home country) prices and eating ""hawker"" food you'll be disappointed. Don't get me wrong - Singapore is great but you need to know why you are coming here."
"Interesting place where you can enjoy the time, admiring the flowers and the trees from all around the world. Well organized in thematic areas, it gives you the feeling to be in many parts of the world in few hours."
"The park was ok, but what you need to visit are the two biospheres which are amazing. Park is somewhat sparse though."
This is a great place to spend a lazy day. Food is readily available and public transportation get you there easily.
"to get out of the concrete high-rise maze for an hour or so in some fresh air. Still too much concrete for a ""garden"" but perfectly pleasant."
"Ther are multiple zones there, which have free zone on different countries, flower dome, cloud forrest and super tree. I tried free zone and flower garden. But I felt the free zone is enough."
"Even though it is a popular tourist spot, you will find places to yourself since it is so huge. But like most things in Singapore, it is rather a gimmicky and artificial garden than something that is more natural. If that's your cup of tea, then it is definitely worth a visit."
"Definitely worth a visit. The high walk is good and the general layout attractive. But it was all a bit synthetic. I'd also have appreciated using a bike to get around. So, we did not stay long on our visit as it was too hot to walk any distance."
Cool place and good for a stroll or a jog. The 5 dollar fee to get up to the skywalk is totally not worth it though.
"It has s lot of different types of flowers from Asia, South america, Europe and etc. u can see it quite close and walking is easy. The temperature inside is also comfortable."
"all ticket offices give out different information, we had a hop on hop off ticket which gave us the walk between the tree ticket. Top ticket office told us to go to the bottom where the trees were and when we went to that ticket office we had to return the the top to redeem ticket. Very frustrating on a hot day. Tree walk was a nice view and ride around gardens were great."
"In numerous trips to Singapore this is the first time I had an opportunity to spend anytime at Gardens by the Bay. Very clever idea, but also quite Disneyesque and a little too touristy for me. This is a One and Done."
beautiful green area nice flowers fresh air good nice clean honeymoon destination but boring if you are funloving and adventurous
"The food there is ok, but this is one place you have to come a visit , love it. Its nice to walk there or take your kids to play at the children's play area."
"We were very unlucky to visit when both gift shops was closed for stocktaking, along with Cloud Forest. It was such a shame as visitors were left with very little choice in terms of refreshments. Either spend $7 + tax for a soft drink in one of the restaurants or drink from the public fountain. Not sure if one gift store could have remained open whilst the other closed, as refreshments would have been on offer on another hot day."
We only walked a small part. it's extremely large and if you wanted to cover it all you could spend an entire afternoon here. Per some other reviews there are other fee based attractions in the garden.We walked around the area near the entrance and paid the S$5 to go up on the walkway amongst the supertrees. I was doubtful about the walkway but after doing it I must way it was enjoyable and the views were worth the small admission price.
"Awesome place. Beautiful sightseeing and cool super trees! Expected more various type of flowers at the flower dome, they mostly had trees instead. Cloud forest was closed due to Maintance. Satay by the bay (about 10 min walk) was nice as well. The lightening at night was cool on the super trees."
"Unique experience entering the free area via Marina Bay Sands hotel, seeing the towering flower constructions. Entering the domes is recommended if you want to experience the creative architecture of the cloud forest and the flower species in the flower dome. It's very artificial however, and one might feel like this is what Mars in the future will look like."
"It wasn't as spectacular as I was led to believe, however the Cloud Dome and Flower Dome were very interesting to visit, filled with information and such a diverse range of plants. The rest of the garden was pretty to walk around but the botanical garden is better for that. At night, the supertrees come to life so it's quite a sight and worth seeing."
Somewhat over rated when compared with the Botanic Gardens. Many parts still to reach maturity and some areas under developed. The area under the skywalk is a maze of not much. Way better orchid display at the Botanic Gardens. A good place for a quick hit tourist visit for a few hours.
"The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest are attractions executed with class. However the management need to educate the visitors, especially those with young children, to keep the noise level down . We had one noisy family and the noise they made travelled far within the Dome and interfered with all the beautiful ambient nature sounds"
"We walked around there both in daytime and during the evening since it was close to our hotel. Very nice park and calm area of the city, just by the bay, but both me and my partner felt they could have done something more. The big ""trees"" are the main event and it was fun to see - good way to spend an hour if you don't feel like going in to the city."
After having a great experience at national orchid garden we were very excited to visit Gardens by the bay.We only choose to visit the flower dome.The dome by itself is a very beautiful futuristic structure but the flora inside the dome was a bit of a disappointment.I found it $18 for entry to expensive for what they had to offer.
rreally expensive for mediocre quality - not for a large group ( + 10p) because of the seating; the beautiful view does not compensate for the poor quality
"I really liked the gardens - but the entrance fee for the 2 domes is in fact far too much for what you are getting if you have seen the stuff already in real life - Must say that I did like the film on the warming up of the earth but most of the exposition seems just too manmade - as such, i recommend that you just enjoy the park."
Went here on my last evening in Singapore. Expected a lot more than just enlighten tree's. It looks a little bit like a scene from the Avatar movie. Not much to do then just walking around..
"Don't get what's the big deal. Wow nice trees, so what? It is just nice and relaxing to walk there, but nothing impressive"
"This place is really big, get ready to walk and get tired, the signage also little bit confusing, and there is no one around to be asked. If you are traveling with kids, please ensure you bring your stroller otherwise they will start to cry because it was really tiring walking."
"We were looking forward to visiting this attraction, but I have to say weren't nearly impressed as we thought we would be . It is a nice venue, however we found the two domes a bit disappointing as far as the gardens went, they seemed a bit lacking. Maybe it was the time of year, but you would it to be constant in a controlled environment. Also a bit expensive for what it is. We did really enjoy the outside areas, it was very pleasant strolling around the parklands. Also, being Christmas time the attractions set up were a bit of fun. Worth seeing, just maybe don't read all the hype."
Can avoid if on tight schedule.. Instead try skypark observation deck on Marina bay sands. you can see the whole garden from the deck and plus view of whole singapore
"Overall, I was disappointed. I was expecting something much more grandeur. The skywalk for $5 was worthwhile but I thought the flower dome and cloud domes lacked value. I wouldn't go to the domes again, but I would do the skywalk again, at night time."
If you enjoy gardens and walking you will like it here. There are plenty of picture opportunities. Everything is connected to the nearby Marina Bay Sands hotel and shopping mall.
"These gardens are very pleasant, with a nice lake, good walking paths and lovely fixtures. But I think the $28 entry fee for the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest is a bit steep, considering their displays are no better than the Botanical Gardens in most cities - which we can all visit for free. Also, the way the air conditioning is set in both enclosures makes them freezing and not pleasant to visit. Perhaps I missed something, but I wasn't super-impressed, just thought they were a nice place to visit."
"Something to pass time in the city. The Super Trees are impressive, be it in daylight or at night when it's light up. Free entrance for the super trees unless if you wanna go up the Sky bridge.We also visited the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome. You'll need to buy ticket to get in. You get to choose to visit just one or both. Enjoy 10% discounts if you buy online at least a day in advance.It was Christmas month, thus the Flower Dome are decorated with Christmas themed stuff. But personally, I do not find it special nor are the flowers attractive/unusual. Unless if you're a cactus lover - huge space for cactus plants.If you've been to the real forest, the Cloud Forest is really hmmm, nothing... But the bridge are nice thou, if you're not afraid of heights."
It is a nice walk around the garden. Seeing the different type of flowers.I do not like the part where I am not sure what flower I am looking at. There was no clear description of the flowers.Not a very big place. Good for photo taking. Bring along a jacket. Might be cold as it is air-conditioned in the dome.
The show mainly contained flowers that are growing in colder climates / flowers growing in Europe. I saw very little exotic tropical flowers. So probably not a show interesting for people from Europe.
"The whole layout is very impressive . The only slight disappointment was the flower dome. From a distance these two structures are very impressive but coming from England with the RHS Wisley and Kew, they were disappointing inside. As it was December I felt there was too much given over to Christmas displays which spoilt the inside. The tall Supertree Grove illuminated at night is beautiful."
It's impossible to find your way around - the signage is terrible. It's very hard to find your way from one location to the next.
"come for a light show and it's beautiful! a great experience..but the sign is little bit confusing i think, especially when you want to go back to MRT or to Marina Bay.. i only found one way out and i have to take a small lift for it.. the queue is too long! try to find another road and get lost..need a better bright exposure when night comes too.. at least to make all the mosquito gone.."
"The gardens by the bay is indeed very unique and very interesting...for nature lovers. The flowers and nature is indeed very beautiful and the layout of the gardens is quite nice. The cloud dome is also quite cool but this is the type of tourist attraction that i would only go once, and once is enough."
"The garden was nicely decorated. However, I was a bit shocked that I have to pay to see the green house. It's nice but not worth the money"
The pictures I have seen of the Gardens by the Bay look awesome. The pictures we took there looks awesome. At the actual place = underwhelming. Its very contrived and not that exciting. At least it wasn't expensive to go up and walk the suspended bridge between the purple trees/towers.
"If you have visited jungles in tropical countries such as Indonesia, Brazil, you can skip this garden. The price is 50 SGD for adult."
for a visitor - a big so what. OK after getting past the Christmas theme - the plants and flowers shown were frankly nothing special imo. Being from California - I went to the California section - imo unless this changes don't walk the stairs. Compared to the Cloud building this is not close to the same.
"The GBTB is a nice pace to visit only because the area is big enough to spend a couple of hours amid the flora & fauna. However, getting there by public transportation is not that convenient as it is a fairly long walk from the nearest train station or bus stop. Walking in Singapore's hot humid weather just to enjoy a garden is not ideal enjoyment"
Singapore is preserving the diversity of nature and forest from the world in this small glass dome. Went there around christmas celebration so it was beautifully decorated.Its a good reserarch place for any botanical student or for somebody who loves flowers photography and study.
"Hey, i don't have point to point review this time but still have shared my experience. .. may be it helps you to decide if you wanna go or not. .good luck-----My mother and niece visited me earlier this summer and we all went for the first time to Garden by the bay.I'm Singapore PR so the ticket charges are different then that of a tourist's hence please present your ID to them for certifications.I took a wheelchair (no additional cost) for my mom which was really convenient for her. I strongly recommend others to get wheelchair too if they have elderly people as there is a huge area to cover.The flowers, cactus etc (definitely enormous variety) but as I'm not so much of a fan so got bored after a little while. Imean how many flowers can you really see:)Still, it's done really nicely and looks beautiful, so i say you should pay a visit atleast once.Later the waterfall vertical garden, excellent, is not for those who are afraid of heights (like my niece).It was fun but to me the whole thing took twice the time it should have taken.I had a baby stroller and my mom's wheelchair but the elevator that i could find could only adjust 1 thing at a time (too small) so i had to go back and forth.Lastly, we could only view the domes as there was thunder and the skyway is closed during rain/expecting rain....Hence all together my experience was a 5 on 10.Hope there was something resourceful for you. Enjoy"
Although there are some interesting landscaping features the only thing that stands out is the Cloud Forest Exhibit. The super trees look interesting at night but serve no purpose during daytime apart from being covered by plants. The whole park remains quite soulless and the entrance fees to the domes are very high which makes you feel like you are again overpaying for something that looks good on paper but lacks the wow factor. Too bad.
"Went there during Chinese New Year with family, aside from ticket price, think all members were quite happy with the thematic event."
"Like: Chance to learn different kinds of vegetation or plantsDislike: Expensive, sometimes overcrowded"
"I would only do this attraction if you have extra time to kill in the city, have your parents or in-laws in town, or, you just need a break from the 90 degree humidity. The flowers are honestly not that impressive, there isn't some groundbreaking new foliage or some insane arrangement that you'll want for your wedding. It does, however, feel really nice and cool and is the only place in Singapore that does not have humidity. That's worth something, right?"
"If you like a well managed botanical garden, with lush foliage, beautiful trees and plants and lots of open space through which to wander - like the ""real outdoors"" except managed and cared for - don't go here; instead visit Singapore's Botanic Gardens, which has had time to develop and mature since 1859. The two-year-old GBTB is more concrete than plants and the charges for entry into the greenhouse structures are high. Even the open transport to take visitors around is expensive. By contrast, the botanic gardens are entirely free, except for the orchid collection, which is reasonably priced."
"We were attending a beautiful garden wedding of our officemate. Being first timer and always wanted to visit this place, took a cab there.From the taxi stand it was a long walk in and it will be good for nature lovers and good place to workout, some jogging and walkabout.Lovely place to take snap shots as the background at night will be the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.There is few things that worth going such as the flower dome, satay bay and varieties of flowers, insects...Good place to just to walk around and enjoy the feel of a garden away from the busy city."
"When I visited the place, the famous Supertree Grove was not lighted at all. There were other tourists visiting the place. The management should have the lights on a daily basis and I was informed by a friend who stays in SG, they perform maintenance after the weekend is off."
"It is a nice walking area with different kind of tropical vegetation and the Supertrees. The Supertrees improved a lot in 12 months but still need 2 years tfor full experience but for me it is sill a ""City"" nature attraction. The Light performance in the night is nice but omittable, to ""artificial"" to me. But it is a very impressive as an architetural experience and an interesting scientific experiment."
"The Gardens at the Bay offer a nice short - but we selected a very hot day. So we just went, took some photos and visited Cloud Forest."
Very festive lights.Not much affordable dining close to Gardens and Supertree. Only expensive restaurants.Very pretty light showView from Marina Bay Sands very goodPorly sign posted and poor onsite servces
"The garden is really interesting, but you do not need to be in Cingapoure to see a garden like this. You can find better gardens eseally around the world"
"I was there during the new year count down. It was an excellent alternative since most places, e.g. Marina Bay Sands, were jam packed and congested.From the rooftop bar of Supertree by Indochine, I got a superb view of the fireworks!"
Someone has made beautiful gardens and wonderful structures but I'm not sure I think I likes the Botanic Gardens better. Or maybe I was just gardened out!
Nothing special when you walk inside. It might be beautiful if you see the whole night view from MBS.
To be honest my boyfriend and I were hot and bothered walking around the gardens. Everything came at a cost.I recommend going late afternoon so you can see it during night and day.The flower and cloud domes looked amazing but of course you have to pay to get in so not ideal if you are on a backpacker budget.
"So you have to admit that the flora and fauna there are very nicely arranged and well taken cared of, and better still, there was air conditioning. But seriously, it was a little lame. I know I came to see plants, but I really was expecting more. U might as well walk into anyone's huge garden and you would probably see the same things, minus the air conditioning. The cloud dome was worse, it was nice at first, with the waterfall and everything, then u need to climb all these stairs and take all these escalators to these different exhibits showing uninteresting and dull showcases of the usual environment stuff, which didn't intrigue me at all, no matter how much I tried. It was like some sort of overpriced school excursion that is just as boring as the last one you had. It was okay overall, but I wasn't really very impressed at all and I think that overseas ones r better and they don't cost as much nor r they that overrated like gardens by the bay."
"For me, a little bit boring - maybe because it was raining and I'm not that enthusiastic when it comes to gardens and flowers. They were super beautiful anyways."
We visited during day time and also explored the skywalk. It was too hot to relax and be comfortable. May be it looks better during night and much cooler.
Enjoyed this but watch out if a very hot and humid day. Food at cafes good but not huge choice for 'non-locals'. The kids wet play area is excellent with some good shade. Recommend up to ten years old only.Unless you do into the 'dome' all free with good bus transport and easy to get taxi's and cheap from city.Worthwhile.
"If you have chosen to travel to a concrete jungle like Singapore, just try to keep it concrete, and don't waste your time and money visiting an artificially constructed garden. Sure, it may seem majestic, with it's waterfalls, concrete trails and unique structures, but it is at best, a mediocre attempt to emulate mother nature. May I suggest you enjoy Singapore at what it serves best, which is an urban lifestyle and selection of dining and shopping."
"This garden might be more appropriate for people who are not serious gardener and for youth audience. Everything is staged. The displays are beautiful and following certain themes. Take the audio tour, it is worth the S$8. When you arrive by MRT, you do not need to take their shuttle. The walk to the park is not far at all. I visited the Flower Dome, the display is divided based on continents. Being from Florida, most of the plants are not unusual. Being an avid gardener, I prefer the original Singapore Botanical garden."
"Though it is not my idea of a Garden, most every attraction in Singapore has to be man made. Loved the concept and the structures. Reminds me of Haw Par Villa without the gruesome fixtures."
"Went there on a Saturday; very crowded. Garden and 'metal trees' not quite finished. The 'skywalk' offers nice views, but was very full and you get ushered along. The light show in the evening was quite pleasant, but nothing really spectacular. Had a meal in one of the restaurants; decent meal and reasonable prices."
"The huge man-made ""supertrees"" that adorn these gardens are spectacular by night, but fairly drab during the day. It's well worth a night visit to these gardens, but their best features for daytime visitors are the Cloud Forest and Flower Domes, which cost around S$25 to enter. If you don't want to pay, and just want to wander around a nice garden, go here at night, or to the old Botanic Gardens in the day."
"The night tour is for the light show, which is great, but after the first five minutes it is just filler...more of the same"
Not much to see really. I took photos and then moved on quite quickly as it was not that interesting for the sightsee-er
"It's a massive garden that has all sorts of tropical plants. Has a great view of the Marina Bay Sands, and has a few attractions that you can pay to visit.The gardens themselves are well maintained, but are not ""awe inspiring"" or something you would write home about. It can be very hot also, given Singapore's heat and humidity.If you have a lot of time to kill or have nothing else to do, then why not visit it? But if you have other preferences, I think you won't miss anything by giving it a miss either."
My expectations were higher having seen it featured on a TV program. I visited on my own. I found the map quite confusing and spent much time going in circles. The flower dome although a nice concept was below my expectations. The skywalk was initially closed but opened just before I left. Not that impressed. I am sorry The super trees were amazing and made for some stunning photos.
But - if you're in Singapore for the first and probably only time in your life - like we were - you probably have to see it.I'm a big garden/flower fan. Have been to many great gardens and flower shows - like the Chelsea Flower Show in London and Butchart Gardens in Victoria (a place a Canadian poster here alluded to) - all over the world.This isn't one of those places. I suspect the light shows at night are better than the gardens/domes (which are far from cheap - especially compared to the bargain of the Botanic Gardens/Orchid Garden).In any event - we walked here from the Marina Bay Sands. It's a very easy 10 minute walk.If anyone from this attraction reads these reviews - I have one recommendation. The domes seemed to have some interesting films/presentations. We would have loved to sit down for a while and watch them. But seating was *extremely* limited (especially considering how many people visit this place) - and it was difficult/impossible to see the presentations if one didn't have a seat. Needless to say - no seats were available when we were passing through. If the goal is to push as many people through as possible - you're doing a great job. If the goal is for people to have a good/informative time - you can do better. Robyn
I was expecting more. I was disappointed especially after all the hype. There was no music just a slow changing colour scheme.
Its place worth a visit. Looks near to Suntec but not really. Difficult to go by MRT and one has to take taxi. Good place for nice photographs. Also this place gives good view of Marina Bay in night
"a lot of flowers, and a lot of walking, i came from canada where there are lots of flowers and trees too so i didnt find this attraction attractive ..."
"I'd say it's not the most amazing place to be, but can be cool if you have time for it. Those ""big trees"" made of steel and recovered with plants are nice, but there's a cost to go up and walk thru the walkway that connects them."
Gardens By The Bay....I visited this with my wife and it's....OK. can't say much more than that. If you are in to trees and plants then I'm sure you will love it. Having been to the Eden Project in Cornwall I think I had my expectations set too high. Never mind..it was a way to spend a morning doing something other than walking around shopping centres.
"The gardens weren't amazing, and a little crowded. Not so many flowers, just a lot of plants. More maintenance and care needed. But the super trees were kinda spectacular to look at."
Not my thing although impressive. Nighttime visit would of been better as too hot to get full benefit.Maintainence being done so didn't get full effect of visit
"Nice place to relax and read a book, probably beautiful at night. When I went here I was so tired and itching to go back to the hotel, but I tried to take it all in. It was really beautiful, especially the Cloud Forest, which was a nice place to cool down. Wish I saw the lights but unfortunately, I was in a hurry to go."
Was a nice thing to see but only worth doing if plants are your thing! You can visit the gardens and take yourself around the park without paying to get inside the conservatories. Hire bikes if possible to explore the city as taxis and the metro miss out plenty of city experiences that are worth seeing. If your travelling with your mum then do it but if not stay away!
There is Antumn Festival at Gardens By the Bay. Many of activities for this festival and the signseeing is so beautiful. It is suitable everybody to relax there.
"Good Urban Structure maintained well, good place for family and kids. These have Polo Car where you pay Singapore Dollar 2 and they take you around.But mind it no stay and no waiting. So click pics and selfie if alone and Tag ue status if a vivid FB fan."
"I went during the orchid extravaganza and expected to see orchids being lined up like the poster but was a bit disappointed as the structure was still being set up despite being midway of the exhibition which was from 16/9 - 22/9. Nevertheless, there were still many types of orchids being showcased. I think a better choice would have been the cloud forest."
It's in a lovely location and is free to enter and wander around. If you want to enter the greenhouses to see the flowers be prepared to shell out nearly $30. Simlarly if you want to enter a supertree it'll set you back $10.
"Nice enough, but a too much of an artificial feeling for me. The main garden is free entrance, but payment needed for the conservatories."
"While the building structure was amazing, wait until you are inside and found out what they had..Visiting this place in regular day would interesting, could you imagine when you visited on an annual event of Singapore Garden Festival?Yes, it's can't be describe by only words..Come and feel then experience the world wide plants series in one place.."
"I visited Gardens by the bay with my family in august. The hot weather was too much but we stayed in the Cloud Forest to look at beautiful walk around the nature inside the big cold glass cap. These gardens are perfectly manicured and there is a shuttle service for $2 two rides to get Flower Dome, Cloud Forest from the entrance. A pleasant day..."
"Place with immense metallic trees will transport you to an unreal world, a good place to relax and stroll leaving behind the hustle and bustle of the city."
too many people and frustrating when they stand in the paths where you need to walk. Not as interesting as was expecting. Liked it but wouldn't rave over it
At first I was thrilled to see this sound and light show for the first time. Subsequently it became just average as I have already witnessed it several times as I am a native of Singapore. But I would encourage visitors to Singapore to come and enjoy the spectacular sound and light show. It maybe for just 15 minutes but it is a worthwhile experience. The sound is really good and solid and the various light colours really do compliment the sound system. Overall for a first time visit I think it is worthwhile experience. Go for the fun of it. I am sure you will be thrilled.
"Though flowers are always nice I find it all a bit 'artificial'.What I really do not like is that they discriminate.Went there with my (Singaporean) wife and (half Singaporean) daughter. Being non Singaporean I had to pay SGD 8.00 more than my partner. SGD 8.00 is not that much for me, but in a country where they claim that everyone is equal this is awkward...Apparently Singaporeans are treated as 1st class, and the rest as 2nd or 3rd class people."
"Recently, I went to gardens by the bay with my cousin from New York.It was a refreshing walk after the rain at gardens by the bay after a meal. We were fascinated with so many plants, flowers and trees grown there. It is amazing to see so many beautiful creations and varieties there.I must bring overseas visitors there again if given the opportunities. Even a walk after dinner with family and friends is a great option."
Visited Gardens by the Bay and was fascinated the sight of so many different species of plants and flowers. Nice place to walk around during the evening. And a great photo location for avid photographers and artists.
"I thought it would be better. The flower Dome was the best attraction, and was worth it, but the cloud display was not so good. The plants were a little sick looking. Too much water. Even in a rain Forrest there can be too much water.In the flower dome, displays were a little mixed as the countries had different plants form other countries in them. The gardens in the park were not really as good as some of the beautiful gardens around the city. I think that is due to plant selection. Still gardens are always beautiful, and the flower Dome was worth the visit."
"A bit like when the Eiffel Tower was built and Parisians hated it remarking that it's a blight on the cityscape, and which eventually became an international icon - I hate GBTB cos it's so artificial and a bit tourist trappy-ish but having visited it a couple of times, I have to say that it remains quite a wonder to the mind and the effort put into ensuring that it represents Singapore's multi-ethnic and multi-cultural roots is worth a mention."
"There is very little lighting in the outdoor gardens, so do visit in daytime to see the gardens - Chinese, Indian, Malay etc.The lighting by the grove trees are beautiful and the music on played. But note that there is timing for the music qlthrough the trees lighting at till midnight.The outdoor areas are free but the gardens - domes and the sky bridge need to pay fee.I brought my friend and her family to see night views of Singapore."
"It was a nice visit to the Gardens by the Bay although not spectacular. I was looking forward to seeing the largest man-made waterfall and this was in the Cloud Forest where you see this the moment you enter the dome. I took the MRT there getting off at Marina Bay station and walking to the newly constructed Bayfront station (under covered) which is actually on the yellow circle line. You have to purchase a ticket for this for foreigners which is SGD$10 for one dome or SGD$28 for both domes (Cloud Forest and Flower Dome) and there was a queue which lasted about 15 minutes when I arrived around 4pm on a Saturday. The Cloud Forest was quite worthwhile, simulating a cloud rainforest where you need to take a lift all the way to the top and gradually make your way down the levels. Getting into the lift was a bit chaotic and you had to push your way through to the next available lift. But coming down the winding walkway was lovely. The Flower Dome was a bit of a let down but others may enjoy the vast area inside with plants from different continents. While I was there in August 2014 there was an orchid exhibit inside which you had to queue up to see! The highlight was Symphony by the Gardens which started promptly at 7:45pm and 8:45pm and lasts 15 minutes each time. This is at the Supertrees Grove and the trees light up in different colours in sync with the music. I was lucky enough to be on the archway at the top during the symphony (also need to remember to buy the ticket first SGD$5 before queueing up). Overall it was a lovely visit and you could spend the day there visiting all the other gardens outside, and try to be there when it's dark so you can see the trees light up in different colours. There is also a hawker centre Satay by the Bay although the food there is mediocre."
"Perhaps it was in part to going here at night, but I found it pretty underwhelming. The worst part is the signage! Trying to find the visitor centre, and then the Satay by the Bay (which is awesome btw). There were signs, but they pointed you out of line and convoluted.We didn't go into the covered areas."
"It's good for a stroll if you live here but if you're visiting and want something to do, this is perhaps overstated as an interesting place to visit.Just a big park to me. It's attractions (the two conservation glass houses and the walk on tree top) charge a fee for entrance. Entrance fee for tree top walk is reasonable and that for the conservation houses are to me a rip off..."
a nice place to go but quite exhausting attraction haha u have to take a quite long walk from nearest mrt stationaccross is marina bay but then again u have to take a quite long walk again to get therenot a merciful attraction to go for old men :D
"It was our first visit to the Gardens by the bay and having experienced the Supertree Grove lightup, the Flower dome and Cloudforest, these are my personal views and tips:SUPERTREE GROVE:This was the highlight of our trip. Please dont miss this as the Supertrees are unique when its lighted up. Its so good to see our little red dot come up with something like this.To fully enjoy the Supertree Grove experience, I highly recommend arriving around late evening eg 7:20pm BEFORE the sky goes dark. Its beautiful when you can still see the evening sky as the lights around the marina area start to come on. The Supertrees also have a faint glow to them at this time. Try to sit in the middle of the grove, facing the Singapore Flyer with Marina Sands on your left.The light & music ""show"" comes on at 7:45pm and 8:45pm, when it is already pitch dark. The light up of the trees is really beautiful. Frankly I would have preferred the trees to be lighted with nice music throughout the night so visitors can enjoy the ambience any time of the night. It's a waste making visitors wait for 7:45pm or 8:45pm for a ""show"" that wasnt particularly spectacular and have the Supertrees in the dark in between the shows. That's why I recommend coming at 7:20pm to see the skyline that's still visible and see how the scene changes whilst waiting for the show at 7:45pm. The Supertrees are fully lighted only during the show itself which is a real pity.The heavy rain in the early afternoon really cooled the place down. I cant imagine sitting in the grove in the heat and humidity in the afternoon. So if you really want to have a more fruitful visit, do it in the evening. Even if you dont pay to enter the 2 Dome Conservatories, this experience at the Supertree Grove itself is worth a visit provided you come at the right time.FLOWER DOMEAlthough I think they did a good job of doing up this dome, we didnt really enjoy it. Simply because we prefer the natural surroundings of a real garden or park where one gets to enjoy the open spaces and sounds of nature. We were in the dome around 4pm when it was fairly crowded with many visitors and school kids. Hence, the human noise and lack of space kept us from truly enjoying the displays in a more serene setting. We didnt have the mood to read the information displayed for each plant and simply walked along as we glanced at the plants.If you are hoping to stroll through the dome and expect a true flower garden or park experience, you may be disappointed. Perhaps the experience may be different in the early morning when its hopefully quieter.CLOUDFORESTWe preferred this to the Flower Dome as it was rather unique and more pleasant. The towering plants and waterfall gave it a more natural setting and the place didnt feel like it was just a giant exhibit.From the entrance, walk in and take in the sight of the lovely waterfall. Then walk further down and take the lift to the 6th floor. Follow the directions and start from the top down.If you only have time for only one dome, I would personally choose this one instead of the Flower Dome.DINING:We had a nice quiet dinner at the Majestic restaurant (chinese cuisine) which is located at the bottom of the Flower Dome building. Though some may find it a little pricey, the simple beef horfun we had was tasty and well prepared. The generous beef slices were tender and the thick kway teow nicely done with some bean sprouts. The portion is enough for two persons ($24) if you are not famished.We included the water spinach (kangkong) with thinly sliced cuttlefish and sambal ($20). This was also very tasty (we requested no MSG and less oil for the dishes) although you will have to ask for more sambal if you want it spicier.The dessert of Chilled green tea jelly with aloe vera, lime was extremely refreshing and delicate in taste. Very good. Tea and peanuts are charged separately. If you order plain water, its $1 for a bottle. It wasnt a cheap dinner as the cost came to $76.50! but we thoroughly enjoyed the meal because it was quiet (6pm on a Thursday) and the food was very well prepared. Nothing irks us more than having to pay a high price for a lousy meal so thankfully, the restaurant didnt disappoint.The menu is on the website under the Dining section.OTHER PARTS OF THE GARDENWe didnt have time to really walk the other parts of the outer gardens and frankly, we just cant do it in the hot afternoon sun and humidity. That's why we chose the 2 aircon domes and Supertrees in the late evening.So to wrap it up, my personal advice if if you are short on time, just visit the Supertrees Grove around 7.20pm, sit and have a drink till 7:45pm when the lights and music comes on.If you have an hour to spare before that, then visit the Cloudforest. It takes about 15mins leisurely stroll from the Cloudforest to the Supertree grove.Its nearer to walk to the Domes using the Dragonfly bridge if you are coming from Bayfront or Marina - check for directions on the gardens by the bay website map."
The gardens were nice but nothing to write home about. Maybe it was because we didn't pay to see the more exciting attractions but I didn't feel the gardens were anything too incredible to be honest.
"Some lovely plants but too much plastic outside. Big tall flowers etc.The light show at night however, is well worth a watch."
Better enjoy the views in the evening from sunset till the dark. Easy access by MRT n get off at Bayfront.
"But, lots of people, lots of concrete paths. The plants themselves are spectacular, as is the setting, next to the barrage."
"Gardens by the Bay is not as I expected. I once visited the Singapore Botanical Garden and very happy to see the orchid gardennya. Because the area is not too large I did not really expect Gardens by the Bay will exceed the Botanical Garden. But what I saw was disappointing in my opinion.I did not enjoy the outdoor gardens, cause I could not bear the heat, though I came at 3 pm. Although the car shuttle is available, but because the service is only available until 5 pm, hence I had to abort the desire to walk around the gardens.The indoor meanwhile, for the cloud rain forest a bit odd. I think the Gardens would like to show the plant as natural as possible, so it planted randomly. For me, it can not be enjoyed.By the time I came in August 1, 2014, in Flower Dome there was a Persian Garden show. I remember in Keukenhoff I can see a lot of wonderful and colorful flowers. But because the area of Gardens by the Bay is very limited, it can only exhibited few kind of flowers, limited in number. In the Californian Garden, for example, only one citrus tree planted, roses are also only a few.Really disappointing considering SGD 28, it's not cheap I think."
"Cloud Forest Dome is closed for maintenance on Monday, the day of our visit, and the Flower Dome is closed on Tuesdays; although in a spectacular building, the Flower Dome wasn't worth the money for me because I was familiar with many of the plants as it is designed to house temperate weather plants. For more spectacular plants you can roam around the gardens for free; the walkway is worth paying for, but is not for people who don't like heights."
"The uphigh path between artificial trees provides nice views. Otherwise garden isn't very special, nice place to walkaround for a while but nothing really special. Recommend visiting during sunset & seeing from the garden side the Marina Bay Sands hotel light up for the night!"
Well laid out gardens with lots of colourful floral displays. Nice to get into the climate controlled area when it got too hot outside.
"You can walk around a lot of the lovely garden for free. It's all really beautiful.It costs money to get into the two large greenhouses and to go up to the bar at the top of the tree-top walk. If you like plants and views, it's probably good value for money.During a visit, we also ate at Pollen. I wouldn't go there again as in my humble opinion the portions were ridiculously small and I didn't think it was good value for money."
"To get there is easy. The MRT takes you to the Marina Bay Sands and then you walk over the flyover and you are here. The place gives you a panoramic view of the Marina Bay and the Singapore Circle too. The gardens are pleasant and well stocked with difference themes. Having visited this place at night and during the day, I would opt for an evening visit. The view of decks lit up and the lights of the city is good. The arboretum has an entry charge and really needs a good half a day to visit."
"Singapore is endowed with some wonderful gardens, some better known than others. The Botanic Gardens, Hort Park, Chinese Gardens and making the biggest and boldest statement Gardens By the Bay.We chose not to visit the Durian shaped halls of botanical wonder but instead contented ourselves with a ramble through this carefully stage-managed area. One cant be awed by the massive supertrees thrusting their way skywards as these are surely the drawcards of the area.The signage is either ill prepared or premature but there were spots we looked for based on the information on our map that we were unable to located. Each often indigenous gardens is of interest and the discovery walk will become a great place to discuss plant life.At the moment it feels that the dream is greater than the reality but I am sure this will grow and change as every good garden should. The World of Palms illustrates where things might well develop.When it all gets a bit much too green it is a simple and delightful stroll to the Marina Bay Sands.The roving icecream cart will be a pied-piper for the kids."
"Well at first sight the whole place is fantastic. The trees are a brilliant idea and the 5 SGD to walk the walkway was worth it.However, the greenhouses are 12 for locals and 28 for foreigners, which is disgraceful. The argument that locals pay for the garden in taxes is pathetic as my taxes pay for attractions in Australia that tourists don't pay extra for. Disgusted"
Great concept but the wayfinding is a bit lacking and on a hot day there is not much protection. Not many places to get a cold drink and the restaurant onsite had run out of everything :(
"These gardens are impressively manicured, in a very Singapore way. They're easy to get to from the MRT, too.The open, free gardens themselves and pretty and well laid out, although not terribly mind blowing. To get into the two conservatory domes, foreigners must pay $28, which, if you've been to a few conservatories across the globe, seems like an awfully high price, all things considered. Yes, the domes are pretty, although the Flower Dome was nothing special. The Cloud Dome was impressive, however, with its massive, man-made waterfall and elevated walkway. The climate change message in the multimedia display was also worthwhile.The OCBC skyway across the Supertree Grove was an extra $5, across the other side of the park. While the Supertree Grove is stunning to look at, I think it would be worth visiting at night rather than day, as once you've been in the Cloud dome, the elevated walkway here doesn't feel too much different.If I had my time again? I'd wander around the park and do the OCBC skyway, giving the domes a miss."
Great place for a little walk and breath of fresh air. Educational in the sense of plants to landscape of Singapore.Would be better if there are more shades and rest points.
"visited the place during my SG trip last July 10-13, 2014...travelled here from my hotel via their smrt and alighted at bayfront..then followed the signs leading to the gardens by the bay exit..the place was full of flower and tree landscapes..the surroundings are also informative as to the informations about trees and flowers..the light shows are scheduled at 745pm and 830pm..even though its raining before and during the show...the rain didn't stop me from viewing the show..the show lasted for 10mins i think...aside from the lights illuminating from the trees..you can also see the magnificent lights from the background of Marina Bay Sands Hotel.."
"We only experience a walk in the gardens, without entering in the conservatories.To be honest our expectative were much higher, the super tree area disappointed us as it was basically a concrete area with this big trees in the middle.Gardens are well maintained but again, not comparable to our initial idea."
"A fortune has been spent on these ""gardens"". I found them hard-edged and architectural. Not a peaceful experience. Glad I went, but I won't need to go again."
"an ideal place for you to take a rest. However, i think it is not so excellent as description. Nothing too special here."
You can instantly tell alot of work and money went into it. Tonnes of stuff and a pretty cool green space with the city scape in the background. Bit pricey for the attractions but a free walk is always nice.
"Gardens are worth visiting, but not the domes unless you love nature. Try going on a sunny day. Recommend travellers not afraid of heights, to pay S$5 for the sky walkway at the Supertrees."
Gardens by the Bay was the other attraction in the list of things to see. Walked down from Suntec though you do have the MRT connection.Nice place to experience the different types of plants and trees all brought under the same roof. Huge effort and there is no dearth of this kind of projects in Singapore.The exciting piece was the waterfall created which seemed amazing during the night.Disappointed - trees and flowers without birds and insects are meaningless.
"Didn't see the inside of the conservatories, so please take with a grain of salt. Plant lovers will definitely find this attraction excellent!"
"It's just a Beautiful garden, i didn't find any food stall there after i went round d place..i was starved.. but i love the Flower Dome inside, even though we have to pay more for it, because the dome was a very refreshing room full air conditioner, cool n lots of beautiful flower inside. n there was a water tap on it."
"After several visits to Singapore, I finally visited Gardens by the Bay just because I ran out of new places to visit and I've been intrigued by the impressive structures of the Gardens whenever I pass nearby. I got there by passing through a bridge from Marina Bay Sands. I didn't have any idea how to go around the place so I purchased a ticket online for the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Both attractions can be reached by walking through a big garden. I would say that both attractions are not that spectacular. I was expecting to see a lot of colors at the Flower Dome but the plants were mostly green. There was just a small part at the lower level with beautiful flowers. The Cloud Forest, on the other hand, had a high waterfall with interesting plants surrounding it as its main attraction. In fairness, it was amazing to see how plants that we rarely see can thrive in a manmade environment. I was amazed, yes, but since I'm not really into plants, I got bored just like at the Flower Dome so I just walked through fast and headed for the Super Trees. As expected, It was an amazing sight! The time I got there was perfect since it was sunset. The Super Trees started lighting up and we got to watch the Light and Sound show. Generally, the Gardens was an ""okay"" experience for me but if you're not really into plants, I would suggest to just visit the Super Trees and the surrounding gardens. No need to buy the pricey tickets."
"Nothing special in Flower Dome...Jungle dome is better.Just add a new experiences in Singapore. Better you set to visit about 3 pm , so you can see the light in evening come"
Interesting once depends on your previous experience I have seen many gardens and natural bush jungles and waterfalls so this is great as a potted view or if you always lived in a city and would be great for someone with limited mobility or disability but otherwise average I would not go back
"I think it's more hype than garden. Some nice parts, but, like a zoo, you're seeing things outside their natural habitat in most cases. So if that appeals then go for it; there are some great plants and the aircon is a bonus. Otherwise spend your time in Singapore taking in more local and cultural exhibits."
"As much as I like gardens, I was really disappointed. Not very well done as a whole. Seemed more a concrete world with greenery thrown in. I even have a difficult time writing this as there was nothing memorable about it."
"I am a regular visitor to gardens by the bay. During my last two visits in May and Jun 2014, they have blocked off the access to the pathway of the lower garden display. As a result, visitors are not able to get close to the flowers and read the display broard. Its takes the fun out visiting the flower drome."
This is an amazing place and well worth a visit. However dont expect a rainbow of colours....its lush and green but green was the only colour I saw. We walked a small part and caught the shuttle around the rest due to it being extremely warm. If you are taking kids pack bathers as there was a cool looking water area we didn't expect.
Its all fully artificial built...Fully air-conditioned and lot of space....The most exiting was the water falls (not for bath)....The height and the magnitude of amazing...
"Loved the idea and concept behind this area, but the overall garden needs more shelter space especially during the hot heat and humidity. The skywalk was great but very scary if you are afraid of heights. Views from up there are superb"
"By the look from above,is like a big huge garden.But only the best you can see is pay to go in the Dome like green house.Other wise outside is free,but hot and humid.There are few gardens ,like Chinese,indian and so on...is boring,not much to see or feel.There's a children water park next to Satay by the bay,is the only enjoyment,if you are bring your kids there.Going there is either by sky's bridge via MBS.or mrt Bayfront (CE1).Wear loose and comfortable clothing,or you end up heat stroke."
Unfortunately our tour and time schedule meant we visited here during daylight hours. it should really be seen when the sun goes down.
"The garden itself is free to public access. It's only when going in to the domes that you need to purchase tickets. For people who are live being surrounded by nature, they would consider it not worth the money and might even feel a tinge of pity for a country that would try to keep nature in such an enclosed structure. But I find this attraction quite proactive in the movement to conserve nature in a modernized approach. The domes are meant to be self-sustaining. Also, they periodically change the theme inside the Flower Dome, which keeps it interesting. I recommend it not only as a an attraction for conserving nature, but also for the wonderful and iconic design of the buildings that serve as conservatories."
"i guess in the future, when it will all be done in the neighbourhood, it will be a calm place to walk and sit..."
"We were advised to go at about 6pm, have some tea (Very expensive to eat there) and then go through the domes. The flower dome and cloud dome are naturally lit so there are no lights inside. By the time we had made our way to the ticket counter, the flower dome was closed and in my opinion the Cloud dome was really nothing to rave about. We went to find the ticket counter to buy a ticket to go up to the sky walk only to be told that it is only open until 8.30 with ticket sales closing at 8pm. The lights show in the 'trees' again was a disappointment - they look fantastic from a distance at night, but the 'light show' was a bunch of lights correographed to music.....not really worth it - glad we didn;t have to pay for that part. My daughter loved it and it was worth it from her point of view, but it was disappointing that the times are not clearly stated re buying tickets and entry times etc"
"I visited the gardens at dusk and really enjoyed exploring the expansive gardens. I bought a ticket for the cloud and flower domes, which were really well designed but no wow factor. I think it would be more fun for families with kids."
"Far to hot during the day, scary at night because long walk in the dark from shopping mall in marina bay. only when you are't afraid of heights."
"I just visited flower dome, but for me taman bunga puncak more beautiful then this place.When night come, you must visit this place because this garden beautiful with light lamp."
Didnt really like the place. Just went for a stroll for probably about 15 mins then decided to head back. Yes the architecture and all was great but just not attractive enough for us.
"Due to 'sprinkling of rain' the Skywalk was not accessible. The Flower Dome, felt very manufactured but, ther Cloud Dome was natural and great"
"Disclaimer: this is the view of a local who lives in Singapore! Tourists may view the place in differently.The good:- The Gardens is beautiful, no doubt about it. Plant and flower lovers will enjoy this place. The Gardens' online brochure practically says it all about what you can find here.- There are some nice, quiet spots where you can have a picnic or packed breakfast/lunch/dinner while enjoying views of Marina Bay or the city skyline (depending on which spot you go to), even during lunchtime where surprisingly the temperatures are quite bearable if you find the right, shaded spot. Early mornings and evenings are better, of course, to avoid the hot weather.- The children's areas (both wet and dry) are very enjoyable for children. They can be entertained for easily two hours or so.- Very nice place for exercise ' lots of fresh air for yoga or tai chi, and lots of space and views for jogging.The not-so-good:- Food ' very expensive. The most 'worth it' for the price is the fast food. That should tell you something. Either BYO or leave the place and go eat somewhere else.- The domes ' very expensive and only for plant lovers. Even with the discount for citizens, I still felt that it was just a big air-conditioned room with plants, and the 'big' isn't even really that 'big' ' I could walk around in less than five minutes. BUT, I must admit I'm not a plant lover. Just like a book browser is in and out of a book shop in a few minutes while a book lover is stuck inside for hours, those who are not really into plants will not find the domes worth the price.Distance ' the Gardens is just too out of the way. There's an MRT that goes there, but for those living outside the city area or away from the Circle Line, it's just too much trouble to go all the way there for'¦ what? The food is nothing special and is hyper expensive. Parks are everywhere in Singapore. Ditto for children's play areas. So, unless you're a plant lover, there's no incentive to spend so much time just to travel there. It's a 'go there once and there's no other reason to go there again' thing.Which also makes me wonder why we spent so much money to build that place."
"The gardens by the bay looks like a modern park that a family would like to go on weekends for a fresh air, the fun, food and leisure time for friends and family, see the artistic touch of modern lightings within the city by the bay at night. That all the people want to see the entertainment if your living in the progressive urban life."
"If you are just visiting, no need to go so early as it can be pretty hot out there. As for us, we walked to the Gardens from our hotel, Swissotel Stamford at around 3pm, so the minute we arrived, we went into the cooled conservatories, Flower and Cloud Domes. By the time we came out from the cool comfort of the air cond, domes,it was about 5.30pm, so we proceed to the Supertrees area for the Skywalk and we finished also by about 6.30pm. Can't wait till 7.45 pm for the lights display. Bid goodbye instead. Therefore best time to eta there is about 4 to 5 p.m."
"The light and sound show in the evening at 7.30 and 8.30 pm is worth visiting, else it is a man made garden with nothing exceptional. The view of Marina Bay sands from there is nice."
Dislike the price(especially the BEER price) the service by the young waiter/waitresses was excellent.the management seemed to be ONLY interested in the bottom line profits and NOTHING else.
"Going there we took the boat tour from Liang Court until the Marina Barrage area and walked until reaching the main Domes: Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Entrance to the domes will cost you SGD28 (price for tourists/foreigners, which is inclusive for entering both domes).The Flower Dome is a huge garden area, but the landscaping is just average for me. That is, compared to the picturesque gardens of Japan that I have visited. Although you can really enjoy a comfortable leisure walk inside since it is an enclosed cooled facility. The 'tulip mania' which I originally went there for was disappointing, because there were not much tulips to see (if you've also been to a field of tulips before, you'll know what I mean).What I appreciated more was the Cloud Forest as it would immediately surprise you with a man-made falls at the main entrance. There is an elevator facility to take you all the way up the dome and have a closer look at the falls and view of the area from above.From the Cloud Forest, we explored the open garden (no more entrance fees) heading to the Meadow to see the white sculpture of the floating infant. Then we walked back and waited for the sunset until the trees of the Supertree Groves were lit and enjoyed the beautiful view. From there, we headed to the dragon fly bridge to reach the Marina Bay Sands in time for the free Light and Water Show (8PM).In hindsight, I would not have paid for the Flower Dome/Cloud Forest, but hey, if you don't mind paying SGD28 for a cool and leisure garden walk, then go ahead. But, it's also fine to just explore the open garden area, and enjoy the night scenery with spectacular lighting."
"The gardens by the bay, gives a preview of humanity future where we would live in beautiful gardens inside a glass bowl. It also gives us a sense of reality that REAL NATURE will be just a thing of the past being inevitable in our failure to change. Passing that thought later, gardens by the bay is a great place to instill awareness of of environmentalism and concerns of helping planet. I do suggest you take take the headphone guide that you can rent before the tour, so you would understand what your looking at."
Go for the free entry at night for the light show. very avatarish. rest is pretty average from a laymen point of view.
"For anyone with even a remote interest in plants and gardening, the Gardens by the Bay offer a brilliant concept that has yet to reach its potential. On the day prior to our visit to the Gardens by the Bay, we had visited the Singapore Botanical Gardens, a more established and, frankly, a more elegant offering in terms of presenting plants in their natural habitat. The Gardens by the Bay are almost like an amusement park, with various little areas of interest (e.g. Chinese garden, Indian garden, Colonial garden, etc.). The openly artificial nature of the exhibits in contrast to the Botanic Gardens (which are surely artificial but in a more subtle way). Perhaps the lesson learned here is to visit the Gardens by the Bay first, but if I were to visit only one (for the first time), I would visit the Botanic Gardens instead. On future visits, though, the Gardens by the Bay have potential (for expansion, new exhibits), particularly considering that we did not visit either of the domes.We skipped the two dome exhibits, which I am going to assume are cornerstones of the Gardens. Partly we may have been a little oversaturated by the previous day's Botanic Garden visit; partly the entry fee for the domes was somewhat expensive.As a tourist attraction, the Gardens offer something for everyone (of all ages - probably more family friendly than the Botanic Gardens). The park is well equipped with restrooms, dining options, shuttle transportation (to just outside the Marina Bay Sands), gift shop, and friendly staff.Despite my average rating, on my next visit to Singapore, I would do more upfront research on the domes to see if they are worthwhile and to see what new exhibits will have been added to the grounds which seemed rather spacious by Singapore standards."
"I have seen other Gardens in other countries, this one did not seemed natural to me.The one at the upper floor is excellent, but not the one on the ground."
"We went to see the tulip show and even though we aren't really into plants or gardening, the gardens were beautiful. We got lots of great photos too.We also enjoyed cloud forest. Their use of space is very innovative and interesting to experience. We had to hurry through some of the displays as we had something else on. We would have preferred to stay longer, there is lots to see and do. I would have liked to have had about 3 hours to see everything comfortably."
"i came here with my boyfriend and it such a romantic place. we came here at noon, the lights on, everything is beautiful"
"Nothing much at all, may be coz i am not in to this kind of places. but the areas is well kept and very nice."
"I'll say up from that the ""Domes"" (ie: Flower Dome, etc) are really a rip-off. You need to pay an entry fee to enter but there's really nothing to see in there. Not impressive at all. The buiding itself, how it was built, the technicalities of how they keep it heated/cooled in there, is amazing. But that's something you can find out on Discovery Channel. Going there won't give you that detail.However, the parks outside (which are free) are very nice for a lovely walk. If you have kids, they will LOVE the playground."
"Go because it has an element of ""wow"" but not to the point where you'd be extremely impressed. It's very crowded on weekends & public holidays... So go during off peak. Be prepared to perspire & get ready for lots of photo taking as the entire ''man-made"" garden has a good landscape. Makes for a nice picturesque panorama"
"GBTB is a just a time-pass attraction. However, I do love the cloud forest and flower dome. Try going at a time where sun isn't right above u. This makes the trip less enjoyable."
"For those who love trees and flowers, This will be your favourite spot.For those who wish to just have a look and feel of the building structure, enjoy its special archi design outside will be good enough for you.There are 2 domes available, I spent about 4-5 hours for the visit."
"If you a want to experience a simulated tundra of different plants from different part of the world, this is the place to go if it is your cup of tea.Credits given to the effort they try to recreate the garden of the worlds and they are some beautiful flowers and plants on exhibit but i prefer to see them in nature."
It is a garden well located around the bay close to the city. Nice relaxing walk either in the morning or evening.
trees trees and trees everywhere that's why it calls a garden lol. take 15 mins or less to walk and move on
"They have very little Choice of Food...bu the location is too good. I would recommend take a few drinks @ the bar on the roof top , enjoy the location and then head to food somewhere else ;)"
"Large gardens, with confusing signage and lack of labels on plants. The free outdoor gardens appear to be better maintained than the flowers and plants in the dome."
"From a man-made garden perspective, this is a top-ranked one but if you're more into nature and natural stuff, this place is not really your cup of tea. There are two conserved areas which are two big dome-shaped glass houses where they house rare plants and species and there's a man-made waterfall inside. I didn't have enough time during my time there and did not personally think it actually worth the price of the entrance ticket (quite pricey) so i didn't go inside the domes. I did go for the tree top walk (again there are some man made tree structures and they put a walk-way connecting the trees where you can walk) which offered a pretty good view on top.Unless you're a local and generally looking for places to stroll by for a walk you'd want to come again. As a visitor, I think once is enough."
"Singapore does man-made attractions really well, and this well-executed, no doubt about it. But the bleached white baby sculpture by a British artist was weird, and the gardens just got a tad repetitious after a while. Good place to go once, but not again."
"Visited the Gardens by the Bay in Singapore in the evening after a busy day. The sight and sound shows were interesting; we enjoyed them. BUT'¦ this attraction closes way too early for Singapore. Ticket sales close at 8.30pm so when we arrived, we were unable to visit the various sections except for the general area. Will have to visit this attraction again on another stay in Singapore."
"To visit the Singapore Botanic Gardens, we spent a whopping $12, which included the MRT both ways, $1 each for the orchid gardens, and 4 Coke Zeros from the vending machine. Fabulous flowers and gardens!!!By way of contrast, admission to Gardens by the Bay is $28 per person plus $5 each for the Super Tree walk, which we greatly enjoyed. The super trees are whimsical, and the walkway provides some interesting photo ops.The whole place seemed manufactured to be a waterfront attraction. The cloud was basically a waterfall plus lots of politically correct climate feel bad stuff.Also we didn't get the whole War of the Roses exhibit, as do many of the flowers were not roses!I had just finished a book on olive oil, so I was excited to see 1000 year old olive trees until I actually saw them......stuck in the dome.And how about the stalagmites and stalactites that had been removed from their place of origin and plopped in a dome?It reminded me of a sad zoo, with plants and formations wrenched from their natural environment. Very plastic and not a good value."
"We went for a walk around here, it was interesting to see the complex but a bit pricey and a long walk from the train station in the sun.We didnt go into the gardens because it was too pricey, and if I remember rightly they had different prices for locals which is racist and I dont support that so just dont go in attractions like that. Not sure if that is still the case."
"Whilst we enjoyed the walk around and the outside gardens were pleasant enough (and free) - I think the dry weather in Singapore over recent months has probably affected them from being their best.The walk that takes you around the sculptures (the huge baby is certainly worth seeing and I loved the giant dragon fly's) and down along the lagoon toward Marina Bay is enjoyable. I wouldn't bother walking the sky-walk, expensive for a few minutes of slightly better views...The cloud dome was impressive, especially the waterfall as you first enter and the range of plants, orchids, ferns etc was enjoyable to see. Some people visiting seemed oblivious to the purpose of the exhibits and saw it as a race to get through it seemed? The views toward the city through the glass dome were quite amazing, especially as the sun started to set.We went to the flower dome as it was getting dark, and although it was worth seeing, it was not as impressive to me (though the ancient olive trees and bottle trees were amazing.....I assume they were real - but hard to be certain!). As it was getting dark, the lighting in here also made the flowers less impressive (to my eyes) as they were a bit hard to see the real colour.All up, an enjoyable experience, though I would think it will improve over time as the gardens get more established. So, average in some parts to very good in others is my rating."
"There are 2 parts of gardens by the bay. The free bits with the giant metal trees and garden are worth seeing. The bits you have to pay for are the domes - 2 of them. Each is $12. 1 of the domes is literally a boring air conditioned landscaped garden. The floor is cemented and there are plenty of pots and fenced areas with various plants inside them. A little like Changi airport.The other dome, called cloud forest is a little more interesting. It has a 6 floor building with water falling from the top to look like a waterfall and the outer walls have plants on them. Inside the building is random stuff and escalators/lifts.The domes are really cold just like everywhere indoors in Singapore."
Felt more built-up than a garden. Too much concrete and structure.Plants selection can be of the more exotic variety.
This botanic gardens is large and very modern. The walk over from Marina Bay Sands is nice and you immediately feel isolated from the city. The grounds are nice to walk among but the main exhibits are crazy expensive. The 2 indoor ecosystems as well as the cable bridge between the artificial tree structures would have been 2x what we were even paying for our accommodation. Just saying.
Visited on day one of a 3 day stop over in Singapore. Very good place to spend a few hours the two pods are worth the visit alone with the sky walk a must. Some great photo opportunities.
"We visited Gardens by the Bay dueing the first day of our visit to singapore. The greenary and flaura fauna around is great , Must try a walk along the singapore river. the tickets are over prized when see the attraction . If you are a flower lover then only visit this flower dome. Must visit cloud dome that is better"
The Flower dome was too cold for enjoyable viewing and the Cloud Forest was very wet and humid from the waterfall at the entrance. I was surprised that all the plants aren't named or the names were placed not correctly so that you be mistaken by the name need the plant. The grounds are very hot with lots of walking exposed to the hot sun and the experience is not well sign posted.
"Seems like its a showcase of plants living together, coming from different parts of the globe, encased within a biosphere to reflect climatic conditions at different latitudes...I think that's the main theme. Which of course has good resonance in our globalised era... However something about it just lacked...I guess, cohesion. Most of the indoor staff seem to come from China, it would have been more cohesive to the storyline if they staff reflected the theme of the distinctively heterogenous (globalised) plantscape. There were several display rooms, one with a video on climate change, which I did not stick around to watch cos it seemed more propaganda-ish than celebratory of the victory of plant-scape, which is what I thought the whole place was about.Entry fees were a bit steep for what it offered , about 20SGD ++.I tried the hawker centre and the food was average. Seriously Singaporean cuisine is much better than this.The gift shop is definitely worth visiting, you even get to 'mint' you own coin. :)Visit sometime in 2013, no I did not record the precise dates."
Sightseeing brochures do not advise ALL ticket sales end at 8pm SHARP....so do not think you can view at 8.45pm for the Night Light display unless you only want to view from the ground.Evening Light display good though - very colourful
to expensive and there is not much to see anyways. The photos are nicer to see than the actual garden. I recommend rather to check out the botanical gardens or the hanging gardens on some highrise buidlings throughout the city.
A lot of the attractions are free to wander around but I was generally underwhelmed by the experience.
"Whilst we were unsure what we would find we were disapointed with the displays and thought entry fees were inflated for what was provided, great structures but whats inside needs to be reviewed"
"I've stayed marina bay sands hotel with ocean view and this garden reminded me of other planet in the universe. Especially, at night, the color of light from three sexy towers was being changed periodically, which was so breathtaking. But when we tried to go there, the only way was through bridge and it was really hard to find the entrance of this bridge. So we had to walk quite a long time even though we've stayed right next hotel. Also roads in this garden were unfortunately just cement. There are many other materials which make better look and Eco friendly. I was not that happy about looking and walking on cement roads in this beautiful garden and forest."
"Might not an ""full-action"" place for younger kids or even teenagers. In my opinion, it's more suitable for grown-ups and older visitors. The Children Gardens, where there's a fish pond - not functioning when we visited it, water game (which are not much - only some fountains and hanged buckets). I wouldn't recommend to visit if you have only couple days."
"Like a lot of the more recent attractions in Singapore there is a lot of show but not much in substance. It's not that there hasn't been a lot of money spent here. It's more that the hype (and expectation) doesn't match the reality. I won't say that you shouldn't visit here when you get tired of shopping, but we had a much better time visiting the Singapore Botanical Gardens. The Botanical Gardens are a little trickier to get to, but are much more worth your effort.If you can, have a look at the ""light show"" at the Gardens by the Bay. It is good but isn't awe inspiring. We love Singapore and have visited there several times, but in our opinion this attraction is not worth another visit."
"Wow, expensive for what you get. $s28 for each building and $S18 to go up the artificial trees. Nice to wander around the park and you can see quite a bit without having to pay the fees. There is a shuttle from the MTR station into the domes which costs $S2."
"Yes, the place is OK and the super-trees and outstanding, however there's not much anything to do here. The light show at night was kinda boring for our taste. OK to watch and wait for it for first timers just for experience. Wear comfortable foot wear when going here coz there will be lots of walking."
"We only did a Skyway walk in the Supertree Grove, and it only took about 10 mins, it was not worth the money, it should be much cheaper. The Garden itself was too hot to walk around, may be more shaded area and seats would help."
"I did not go into the two greenhouses. But everyone raved about this place to me. It's pretty, it's nice, but totally man-made and artificial. I guess it fits into the Asian definition of natural, but it's far from it for Westerners who know better. It's worth seeing, but to get excited and say it's the most beautiful place on Earth is a statement made by people who don't spend much time away from their office. So so. What you would expect next to a casino (which is very impressive BTW)."
"I went with my family to visit this attraction. We decided to venture into both paid observatories (both air-conditioned) since it was our first time there.One observatory had many plants and flowers. Till today, I am still clueless of what I saw in the second observatory except for a simulated waterfall and a 6 floor high suspended walk. Both my kids love it as they are oblivious to heights. I have to admit I am not able to appreciate the plants from different countries there and after a while everything looks about the same. A place for botanist then? I do not think so.There is also a children's park there which was good ... and less taxing in the pocket (i.e. free). I noticed there were many local expatriates there who have learnt the local customs - go for only cheap and good. The gardens itself is free. However, in order to see more, you will have to navigate under the Singapore sun. Now, if only the young plants could just grow a tad faster.The observatories are worth a visit (note: singular) for locals and tourists. You can always visit the gardens anytime and it is less crowded than East Coast Park."
"If it is part of your extend walk or exploration of Singapore River then Gardens By The Bay is great but it is not really worth the cost for a family of 4 to enter. Artificial environments in a tropical environment doesn't make sense to me. We as a family preferred the complete experience of walking along the the Singapore river from Robertson Quay, Clark Quay, The Asian Civilization Museum, The Fullerton , the Esplanade, all the way to the Marina Barge via Gardens By The Bay."
"It just didn't do it for me (nor family). Just seemed to be far too much concrete and walkways compared to plants/gardens. Too contrived. Confess did not go in the domes but really could not wait to escape.Maybe being a tad naive - but was not, for me, either an exotic display of colours i.e. formal, nor wide-open areas with families lazing/playing ball games etc."
It was a pleasure to be there in early evening - as the place was so cool - as compared to what others experience at noon - reading from the posts. The waterfall inside the dome too is really nice. You can have a walk near the Marina Bay Sands and I got the change to watch a giant Nemo illuminated kite during my visit there as it was already after sunset that I left. You can also try to aerial walk which is worth it.
"I found the entrance fee for the 2 conservatories for non-residents too pricey, though (I understood you must pay 28Dollar for both), so I skipped it."
"Gardens by the Bay in Singapore is one of those attractions you will want to see while visiting the city. However, do not expect too much and do not be deceived by its name. It felt more as large cemented spaces with some plants around than actually proper gardens. The gigantic artificial trees which have been there for about a couple of years and which are supposed to be the main attraction, have yet to be covered by vines to the top. It gives the impression that the project has not worked that well. While you stroll around under the hot sun with little shade for protection, be aware of the vehicles taking tourists around. Whenever there is a wide path, there most likely will be a mini-bus driving by. What surprised me is how fast they drive, considering all the children running about. About price, well, the park itself is free, but you pay for all ""extras"": the green houses, the tour to the top of the giant trees, the mini-buses, etc, etc. In the end, it adds up. As for food, I was not too impressed with what there was on offer, but what you will find is the average tourist food typical of touristic attractions anywhere in the world. On bathrooms, there are not many in the middle of the park and these are small. I had to use one of these early in the morning when there were not so many people at the park yet. It had only 2 cubicles: one was for squatting and the other for handicapped people. And it was filthy. Overall, though, I'd say go and check it out. But if you really want to see beautiful, real gardens, go to theSingapore Botanic Gardens. It is absolutely one of the best in the world."
"I was disappointed, The plants were just like all the plants I could see any day. But on the whole it was well done. Walking in the mist was good."
"The gardens were very impressive, but I just melted - and it was not even really hot; just no shade and not enough seats to have a rest, or drinking fountains. Take hats, sunscreen, lots of water and be prepared to wear out your shoes."
"Its a nice looking place, costs to go inside the glass houses. There is a nice area to walk around outside and chill out, but there is nothing else really around the area apart from the Sands"
"The gardens are neat, have great collection of flora from around the world, neatly arranged, manicured gardens, controlled temperature. Its like being in a huge nursery.But the whole purpose of being in the nature is 'natural surroundings', which is lost here."
"Big, but not as impressive as I expected. Probably they are better by night. Still worthy a visit, but don't make it the main target for the day."
Nothing great for someone who has seen better stuff. Very humid.But good location to take lots of pics.
We were a little disappointed with the display and felt that gardens at the airport were much better..I guess we didn't realise that most of the plants were those that we grow at home in Aust.
"If you do visit, make sure it is in the morning to afternoon. We had to wait 30 minutes+ for a taxi at 6pm, amongst a long long line of others who were waiting as well. There is no signal to call a cab, there is no cab coordinator. Once a cab turns up, it is anarchy of people trying to get the cab."
"A nice pleasant stroll from Marina Bay Sands link to Gardens By The Bay. It would have been better, if the Gardens have more flowering plants, rather than just greenery and bushes everywhere. The food mall at this attraction was excellent and offers a wise range of local Singaporean food at reasonable prices."
I think the flower dome is similar to botanical gardens but inside a giant glass dome. The cloud forest can not compare to real waterfalls.
"Impressive structure - but again commercial interests mean there is no one around to provide directions - where to start, which levels to got to, which lifts to take etc. It seems you are left to your own devices and no -one on had to assist. So a very average score for this attraction."
"Flowers and shrubs did not look well cared for. Displays were well-planned though. They close these domes about every 3 weeks for maintainence so I guess we were there at the worst time.We paind for the other dome too but didn't have the time or the strength to ""do"" it. I pushed my husband around in a wheelchair which we had to hire."
To enter the flower dome and cloud forest dome it is very expensive and can be quite boring unless you really like flora and fauna. I finished both domes in less than 40 minutes. They are air conditioned inside so can go during heat of the day.
"We need to walk a lot to reach the destination from the nearest MRT. This exhausted me completely.The set up was nice. Place was clean & well maintained. Since there are no natural mountains & waterfalls in Singapore, the government has taken an initiative to build them within Gardens By The Bay. For most Asians, it doesn't seem attractive as we have many hill stations, mountains and waterfalls within reach. Paying a huge amount to see the same built artificially seems unworthy.Watch tower there, gives a view of the places nearby."
Was not as good as I expected. We could not do the walk in the trees due to a storm and this did spoil the visit. Probably worth going to visit at night when the lights are on
Actually quite difficult to get to it on foot!!! Signposting not brilliant. Interesting super trees and probably should have spent longer. Plenty of walks there and different styles of garden which will improve with maturity
I did not like this attraction because it is(1) unnatural(2) expensive in term of admission fee(3) signs were not good so I had to ask for directions to the MRT from fellow visitorsI admit that I went because it is one of the newest attractions in Spore but was disappointed.
"We took the MRT and got off the Bayfront station in order to get to the gardens. It was quite a walk but the beautiful scenery of the gardens and the Marina Bay Sands are more than enough to make up for it. The Supertrees Grove is the stand out of gardens with tree-like structures called Supertrees that dominate the Gardens' landscape with heights that range between 25 metres (82 ft) and 50 metres (160 ft). The Supertrees are beautiful especially when they light up in the night. Since we got there quite late in the evening, we only managed to visit 1 garden so we picked the Cloud Forest since reviews seems to be more favourable than the Flower Dome. The ticket was S$16 for non-Singapore residents which I thought it was quite expensive. The main attraction of this garden is the 35-metre (115 ft) man made waterfall. We spent a lot of time taking pictures in front of the waterfall but as for the rest of the forest they were kinda bland with mainly tropical plants found all over the earth. Nonetheless, the garden was very well designed with interesting pathways all the way up from the top to different levels of the ""forest"". The last part of garden before exiting was ""5 degrees"" featuring an video show on what will and might happen if the temperate of the planet rises with an average of 5 degrees Celsius due to global warming, which I found it interesting since environmental issues are always quite close to my heart.Overall, Cloud Forest was a cool place to visit, literally cool because of the waterfall which provides cool air all over."
The domes are quite expensive and the Flower Dome is tame; Rain Forest is better but the real forest is not so far away!
A friend took me here on my visit back to Singapore. The place is pretty neat when you go at night because everything is lit up. If you going during the day time there are not much to see and it's too hot anyway. Something to visit while you're in the country.
"The metal trees were different and I liked the variety of lush green palms.It was a nice walk. However, I was hugely disappointed in the Flower Dome which supposedly featured wonderful flowers from all corners of the world.There was nothing in there that I do not grow - or grows in neighbours gardens where I come from in New Zealand. The $16.00 entry fee was not worth the money I paid!I didn't venture into the ""Cloud Dome' after having seen the ""Flower Dome'."
"As a singaporean, i find that local places of interest tickets a bit costly compared to overseas. For that amount of price u probably will expect more things to see and more X factors.There is the cloud forest and the flower dome conservatories you can visit. The cloud forest is a huge greenhouse conservatory with a man-made waterfall and linked pathway leading you up and then down again. Along the way you will see a mini hill of flowers and plants. But if you happen to go on days with many tourists you can;t take good pictures and it will be a bit cramped.As for the flower dome, it showcases different species of flowers. If you are a flower lover you might like it.Personally i think it is just alright as it is all man-made. i think a natural rainforest trail/hike, an african safari tour or a real snow capped mountain in other countries will be more beautiful."
"Quite expensive day for an artificial garden. i would recommend going to the Botanic gardens instead, the orchids are lovely."
Not that much there really. Enjoyed the flower dome better than cloud one. Liked the video on the future at the end of the cloud dome experience. Building is impressive.
Boring place to go! Expensive and boring :( Nothing to do nothing to see...! Wasting of money and time :(
"It's quite pricey for a botanic garden (S$28 for two conservatories if you are a visitor, S$20 for locals). The indoor waterfall is quite impressive, but that's about it. Alternatively, head to the free Botanic Gardens, or McRitchie Reservoir, to sample the nature in Singapore. If you do go, bring something warm to wear inside the greenhouse!"
"If you're into plants then maybe you'll find it more enjoyable, but be warned that it's not the best place to be on a humid day.Not sure i recommend the sky walk. It's only $5 but such a short distance I was disappointed with it."
"Had tickets for Gardens by the Bay as part of a package for attractions in Singapore, when got there one dome closed which agent booking had not bothered to tell us. Worth going and having a look at, need to visit domes in daytime, but worth going to general area (free of charge) at night to see supertree show. If you catch the MRT there is a shuttle for $2 that takes you to main part of park and back, as is a fair walk otherwise."
"I heard this gardens cost Singapore 1 Billion SGD. That is why the entrance for the halls is almost 30 SGD. We did not pay that.But we did a stroll through the gardens, and it was nice. The tall trees illuminated are impressive."
"I agree with one of the reviewers that everything reeks artificial in the garden.The outdoor garden is free except if you want to walk on a bridge high in the air to get a panoramic view of the entire garden, then a small fee is payable.Avoid paying for the cart on the outside of the garden. It is just a short walk into the garden.One can pretty much finish touring the outdoor garden in 30 min.The indoor gardens are better, but there is entrance fee for all.The indoor waterfall is nothing spectacular. One should visit the waterfall in the Jurong Bird Park which is way better.Ladies are advised not to wear skirts for this visit. All walkways in the air have grid-like design, and so is visible to all below.Tip: save the time and money to go to the Bay Sands which is more awesome by far."
"You really need to avoid the outdoor gardens unless you are able to be early riser or looking for something to do in evening. The walk from MRT to entrance to domes is not super far but will certainly make you sweat if you do it at noon.The flower dome was well laid out, plenty of blooms but you would be hard pressed to spend more than 30-45 mins in there. The rain forest was interesting but I couldn't help feeling some of the plants look a little stressed... Brown leafed sections of the trees. I guess they are still feeling their way round what works in this environment and what doesn't. The display of multiple hacked off stalagmites ands stalatites from "" caves all over the world"" really didn't appeal to me as they just looked like dried out white crystalline objects. What a pity they weren't left in their original locations where they had been for thousands of years. Bizarre.So we spent maybe one hour in the domes and for me SGD 56 seemed just a tad expensive. Certainly wouldn't do a re- run. An engineering marvel and perhaps a botanists dream..."
"We love the concept of combining education thru the park.Yet if we are a family of 5, the cost is quite expensive. Also there's a different price between locals and tourists...dont' think it's very fair.Even though we would like to visit again, given the cost of the tickets, it's not very likely.Also, the flowers in the centre of the dome changes according to the theme, Last time we visited, it's Chinese New Year and it was nice. This time, it's Thailand but all flowers were plain where you can see everywhere in the wet market... not very innovative and worthwhile... I even think it's a waste of money and effort!"
The Cloud Forest is a very impressive conservatory with several floor linked by walkways and a stunning waterfall. Unfortunately quite a few of the larger trees are dead and some of the plants are diseased. (I am a gardener so I am picky!) The Crystal room is basically a room where they have hacked some stalagmites and stalagtites from a cave somewhere and plonked them in - not a very good example for kids.
Entry is free to the Gardens unless you want to visit either of they who sci fi looking domes showing flowers in one and a cloud forest in the other. We chose to avoid these and take a shuttle cart guided tour through the gardens (nominal fee) which we followed up on foot. Very relaxing and very pleasant. Bought lunch at a hawker market in the Gardens (you know it's good when staff eat there) and spent an enjoyable afternoon exploring the gardens before heading back to Marina Bay Sands MRT for the train ride home.
"It would be better to go there in the afternoon. The sun can be quite annoying in this modern garden since many of the walking areas have cement platform which reflect sunlight. Flower dome is interesting with so many flowers blooming in pretty colors. But the cloud dome is rather plain for me. The most interesting part is only the waterfall,I like Botanical Garden better, it's more natural and it has fair price. I think it's ridiculous to pay for the audio files to learn about the flowers' names. (Yup, they didn't put any of the flower's name, so when you are walking around, you can be quite busy guessing.)"
I found this destination to only be okay when compared to the botanical gardens. The cloud forest dome was worth the trip to that area. I didn't see the light show so that might have improved my rating.
"It's easy to get here by MRT, and it's a lovely stroll. The gardens outside are free-of-charge, but you need to pay to enter the Cloud Dome, Flower Dome, and the Skywalk amongst the 'Supertrees' that light up at night. There's a waterfall in the Cloud Dome, and it's supposed to showcase the different vegetation found at varying elevations, i.e. you climb up the 'mountain' and see what grows on each level. The flower dome has flowering plants from various countries, and there's usually a big central display. There were also impressive carvings of various birds such as eagles when I went - I actually liked those better than most of the flowers!All in all, it's nice to visit, but a bit pricey for a garden that feels rather artificial."
Unfortunately the entrance to get up on the trees is too expenisive. Nevertheless it is cool to take a look at the free garden area first by then and then by night!
"I found the plant variety repetitive and a little like looking at the variety in my grandmother's backyard (fuchsias, daisies, common types). You pay a considerable amount for this experience so I was expecting wow but got ""lovely"".The eatery service was shocking. Had to drag the disinterested waiter over to be served and we were the last to receive food, even though first seated. Take a cut lunch from 7/11."
"It is a great one time visit to the Gardens and a must for any botanist (i guess). There are many species of plants around and it is quite informative. The tress are splendid to see after dark and are a delight to watch during the light and sound show. You can also climb inside the tree for a fee of SGD 10. The sky walk ( tree connector ) provides a good view.There are couple of domes as well which are a decent visit if u are into plants and stuff. It was not my thing really so I wasnt much impressed. My friends liked it though. I liked the view from the flyer and marina bay sands.Overall, good place, but i wouldnt really recommend if you are not interested in plants, trees or hebrs (?). I would rather enjoy the view from the Marina Bay sands connector or the flyer."
"I thought an evening visit with kids (12 & 9) might be a nice end of day treat. We got there at 730. Told by lady at ticket desk it wasn't worth getting tickets for flower dome or sky walk, so bought tickets for cloud dome. This was lovely and atmospheric even though lighting was very low and interpretation was minimal ( we didn't have audio guide and signs are not very visitor friendly). Still, a nice if slightly expensive experience. We had dinner in decent restaurant - but like Docklands in Melbourne - no one is around and there is no vibe, despite spectacular setting. After dinner wander through Super Trees and gardens pleasant and we enjoyed the lighting and displays. But trouble really set in when we realised we were not going to be able to get a taxi back to our hotel. It's like the Dead Zone! We ended up walking to Marina Bay Sands and waiting in enormous queue - home at midnight!"
"There are still some places in Singapore you can visit without feeling the pinch. The Gardens is one of them.The outdoor gardens are free and nice for a walk when the sun is not scorching hot. As with everything else in Singapore, they are very well maintained.At night, there are two light shows at the Supertree Grove which provides better appreciation of the 'fake' trees - metal structures with real climbing plants compared to seeing them in the daytime. Great for photography. For a fee, you can go up to the sky walkway linking the trees.The two conservatories can be visited for a fee - not cheap. Go for both for a small discount. Best to give them a miss if you don't have much time to truly appreciate the flowers and plants. I managed to squeeze in the Flower Dome before my bus trip home. If you want to photograph flowers, best to have a macro lens.In the evenings, joggers and cyclists can be seen using the space between the gardens and Marina Bay Sands. A nice bit of green lung in the middle of the city.I have not been to the Singapore Botanic Gardens yet but I suspect that place is more organic. Gardens by the Bay though well-kept, feels a bit artificial."
This was a average park. The park prices are a rip off. The glass exhibit was closed on the day me and my wife went and they still wanted full price.
"adjacent to the Marina Reservoir.Gardens by the Bay is an integral part of a strategy by the Singapore government to transform Singapore from a ""Garden City"" to a ""City in a Garden"". The stated aim is to raise the quality of life by enhancing greenery and flora in the city."
It was ok. However it was crowded and the greenhouse domes weren't very interesting. However the waterfall in one of the domes was great! One dome had a small field of flowers and dragonflies. It had heaps of cactus and trees. The other had a waterfall that you can go all the way up and a lift for disabled. The trees that light up looked awesome at night. It was an alright experience but I wouldn't really recommend it.
The gradens by Bay is good like any other garden in singapore. i think the outside garden is not that great unless you pay 28$ for access to conservatories. Lots of asian food options.
"Some of the outdoor gardens were not completed or had very new plantings, so walking around the outdoor gardens lacked the beauty and serenity I associate with a mature botanic garden. It was also very sunny with few shaded areas, so it was hot and humid to walk around. There were also flying insects, so it might be wise to wear repellant. I noticed the groundskeepers were wearing mosquito netting, and dengue fever billboards were posted on our approach to the gardens.The indoor air conditioned gardens were a bit expensive, but nicer than walking around the outdoor areas. If you plan to go, definitely plan to visit the indoor gardens and bring an umbrella for shade for walking the outdoor spaces. Overall, the large scale of the development was not inspiring and lacked intimate gardens with character."
We went there during night time so what we saw are the different lights of the different figures. So we just took some pictures. We also saw some kind of a mini-cultural concert.
"We had an excursion here and it was great for photo opportunities. Most of the time was spent admiring plants and flowers, which got dull after the first 20 mins. I did enjoy the walk through the ""clouds"" though. Can't get that anywhere else except for haze season. :P Not worth the $$$."
the enclosed gardens - flower forest and forest.. are aboslutely worth a visit.. rest of the garden is so so if you have lot of time..but access the sands marina from there is value connection..
Amazing place ! first step on the human made land is a big surprise! OMG this is what human made really ? am so proud of human race. This garden is nice but have to visit in the evening which have a show swithch with marina bays be in a hurry to arrive before becuz show is very fast n unfortunately we miss it ! ;( If you miss show they will still Light color LED but no movements ! this garden have show 2 times please check show time inadvance plan and go ! Compare to botanical garden I love botanic more !
of course you will see these gardens from above if you visit the marina bay complex and it s swimming poolyou have to see it from above to understand more what you will see down
The supertree section is worth watching rest of it is pretty much like any other big botanic garden.
"An interesting place for a wander and nice air con greenhouse with some pretty good views of Marina etcWould not fancy a whole day here but a half day coupled with some food was nice for us.Looks fantastic at night but I was leaving then so not sure if the gardens are open then, seems like indochime was getting plenty people coming for dinner and drinks"
"The scale is impressive. It can be very hot & there is a lot of walking; if you are not used to Singapore's heat and humidity go in early evening. Great views if you can stand the height from the tree walk. The indoor gardens are also interesting (& there is air con). However, I feel that the entire place is verging on being kitsch, so go with an open mind. If you want greenery, go to the Botanic Gardens or Fort Canning."
Didn't really see the point. Obviously designed and built to offset the carbon footprint of Marina Bay Sands precinct it has very little other appeal...
we went as a family and frankly its too overhyped. its just once is a while just because of its concept. the cloud dome is still nice and worth an experience but flower dome is a total bore.i would not recommend you spend $10.00 on it until you are fascinated with plants and flowers.its fate would probably end up the same as singapore flyer and tourist fill find it boring and not worth spending time.
"Found the ""super trees"" very impressive from a distance and was lookiung forward to our visit. On arrival, the flower dome was closed. We also made the mistake of going to ""Satay by the Bay"" during the daytime- this is clearly an attraction for night time only, as there was very few people there at lunchtime and zero ambience.Was quite disappointed to see that a number of stalactites/mites have been removed from nature for a plastic display in the dome. These take millions of years to form... Also had a picture in my mind of the engineers pilfering plants from the Genting Highlands for their project. There is a strong mouldy smell in some places. Found the educational display at the end interesting (though ironic, given the carbon footprint erecting this place must have made)."
"Nice park, with funky designs and nice greenhouses. But everything cost a bomb and after a while it just felt like a money making scam more than a garden/park..."
The garden was okay but guess in a few years it will look more natural.Still nice to walk around and enjoy the special constructions
"Having watched the gardens slowly take shape over a number of years it was great to finally be able to visit the finished product during my visit to Singapore. However, I felt a little disappointed by various aspects of this attraction after my visit. Whilst large and impressive, the gardens felt poorly maintained on closer inspection - both with the plants themselves and also parts of the landscaping/ornamentation. I was actually a little shocked by this considering how well maintained Singapore is in general and considering that the gardens have only been open for about a year. For example, there were lots of large terracotta statues dotted around the gardens with holes and/or broken off ears & tails, etc. and there were even a few dead trees in the Cloud Forest dome. I bought tickets to visit both domes and enjoyed wandering around both but thought they were a little overpriced as I didn't stay long. You can get 10% off the domes' admission price if you show your SIA boarding pass. I really hope they improve their maintenance program - I'd like to revisit in a couple of years to give the gardens & plantings some time to mature."
"These gardens look attractive from a distance and entry to the garden is free. Once inside get ready to empty your pockets to see the attractions such as the tree top walk, flower dome etcThe gardens are easy to get to from the Bayview MRT station or the number 97 bus which stops outside Marina Bay Sands Hotel."
"The name of the garden was so attractive at first but I was a little disappointed after the visit. It is very spacious and I guess for Singaporean, it must be a great spot to hang out with friends, bring in kids for cycling or picnic in the big lawn. However, no matter how much it looks so Great in the Flower Doom and Cloud Forest, it is still look abit too unreal. Maybe I am a traditional visitor and would still prefer the old style of botanic garden. You better prepare at least 3 hours if you like gardening to walk through the whole garden. Don't forget the sun cream and have enough water with you. In a hot day like Singapore, you need the above to keep your journey going."
"Like clean place I feel over charge .need to take the taxi,plus when get there take the tour by bus for 20 mint which explain about the garden if you want to go early morning the weather this very hot ."
"The gardens are a welcome retreat from a bustling city. However, my kids liked hiking and walking in Singapore's Southern Ridges and Chinese Garden parks over the contrived park. For instance, my 8 year old said ""why is this an Indian Garden? It talks about Indian culture instead of the plants!"" There were some educational information about plants in the less visited areas but not enough to make it worthwhile. Canopy walk is literally from exactly one super tree to another and $5 seemed extravagant. Try treetop and canopy trail along the Southern Ridges of Singapore - long paths, free and a true feeling of being one with nature. The day we visited, it was extremely hot - in the hour or two we were there, we did not see a single place to get drinks. Carry some with you."
We went there that we can enjoy the nature; we did but a lot of stuff that is artificial. I mean it's my personal view but I prefer to go somewhere else where I can enjoy the real nature.
"We were expecting a little more from the ""Trees"" and to be able to have good views as it was advertised as a free attraction. However, there is a fee to go up the trees as well as into the conservatories. There is a food court and we stayed and had a burger which was pretty poor tasting and poor value."
"This review is only based on the free Garden area. We didn't go up to the domes as time wasn't on our side. Perhaps on another visit.It was a bit of a let down as there were more more foliage than flowers.Garden was clean, and well set up. Interesting design of the Supertrees. The Garden covers a vast area,and it's easy to tire out. Best to take the shuttle around."
"We were told by our friends that this is the new must-do in Singapore. Having been so impressed by the botanical gardens when I visited Singapore years ago, the Gardens by the Bay was a bit of a let down. I agree with another reviewer's comment: more foliage than floral. Pretty flowers were few and far between. The educational posters in each of the garden areas (e.g Indian, Chinese, Malaysian, Colonial) might have been interesting except they did not seem to be much related to the nature around them. The supertrees definitely stand out -- I'm undecided about if they are really interesting though or just plain ugly. (I have a similar feeling about Shanghai's Oriental Pearl Tower.)The women's bathroom I visited was clean.We opted out of visiting the two domes and supergrove skywalk, and headed to the Marina Bay Sands, where we caught some great views off a 57th floor."
"An intriguing example of man having impacted so greatly on nature that he's had to recreate it. The structures are impressive, the domes interesting but for anyone interested in the plants they house a little disappointing - mainly due to the sparse labelling throughout. Very crowded on a Sunday afternoon and frankly not really engaging enough to warrant the time or money. A shame as I'd been looking forward to it greatly. Perhaps, as other reviewers suggest, it's a garden best seen in the dark!"
"My wife uses a word to describe something that a bit stupid, boring, nothing special and a waste of time. That word is naff and that's what the interior of these buildings are. Naff.The building itself is impressive but under the surface it's not that good which is pretty indicative of Singapore as a whole.The cloud forest is a huge lump of concrete with vegetation growing on the outside of it that you can walk through and around and up and out of etc etc. You you've never seen a flower before of walked around a tall structure then you might be impressed otherwise it's naff. Some nice flowers are growing on it here and there but mostly its just green shrubbery with water vapor misting around it. And that's about it. The whole thing is just one huge water shrouded garden trellis you might grow in your backyard.The flower dome is a much nicer and has a range of flowers from some parts (not everywhere, just some parts) of the world but again, nothing special. It appeared to be a place designed for marriage photos and receptions. (Singapore is exclusively focused on and designed to make money, nothing is free).So if you want a pleasant air conditioned environment to waste a few hours then this place is ok but otherwise don't waste your time and go to country that has a proper flower show."
"Very accessible 'free to enter' park area which is surprisingly large, considering its proximity to the Central Business District. Visitors can cross a link bridge from Marina Bay Sands Integrated Resort to get the the Gardens. Only visited Flower Dome. It must have been quite a feat of engineering, though the final result was fairly underwhelming.Overall, a nice place to spend an afternoon/evening, though perhaps not a must-see."
"I have been to Gardens by the Bay quite a few times since it was opened in June Last Year. In the beginning, it was rather interesting but the flowers were not well preserved after welcoming visitors for a year or so. The Flower Dome does contains exotic plants and flowers but the outside which does not require an entrance fee is not well maintained and the variety of flowers are limited. Everything is organized in an orderly manner and plants and trees are planted in an ""unnatural"" way, so, do not expect to really feel like you are in the actual place."
"Visit only if you are near the MBS after visiting Casino, otherwise don't bother, man-made garden. Hot and humid, you will sweating all over."
"There are two differents exhibits or area, one area is where u can view trees n flowers from different parts of the world. Olive trees, australian plants n flowers, cacti of different varieties.etc. It is airconditioned( something good to get away from the hot humid weather tat we have in singapore) and have different levels of displays. It is a good photographic spot for you to enjoy. Another area id called - snow cloud area, it has a man made mini water falls tat is quite high where u can take the stairs or elevator to enjoy the view from the top. It has a hanging bridge where you can walk in a fog like atmosphere. Best to go in the morning where it is less crowded."
"Their is no doubt that the structure and architectural aspects are incredible however my personal opinion is that unless plants are really your thing most people will find this attraction is a little overrated. Their are two main covered areas ""the Flower Dome"" and "" the Cloud Forest"" , beside those there are some water features and and outdoor mini attractions .First of all try and avoid visiting in the morning as you will not get the benefit of the lighting and the backdrop of the city skyline . During the day the gardens can be a little bland.Second be prepared for a lot of walking especially if you want to see the outdoor attractions. Both the flower garden and the cloud forest can be covered in under 40 minutes walking at a leisurely pace. By the way if you do make it all the way to the Secret Garden at the top level of the cloud forest during the daytime you will be very disappointed as there is hardly anything there. At night the city skyline as a backdrop provides an interesting view. The outdoor attractions will need perhaps 60-90 minutes."
Educational for kids but abit boring for adults unless you are into photography or like nature.Recommends Verandah Contemporary Asian bistro as the food is reasonably priced and delicious. However do more that it closes at 2.30pm for preparation for hi-tea.
"Likes:- The new Satay by the bay has great food and great seating area for young children.- Cloud forest is really cool, a great escape from the hot and humid weather outside.- Easy terrain for strollers, skate scooters- It's really big, there are lots of little gardens which I have yet to discover due to time constraint.Dislikes:Lack of shade - bring your own shadesLots of mozzies - even the mosquito patch doesn't work!Tip: Have a really early dinner before 6pm at Satay by the Bay to get good seats without the queues at the carpark, crowd, waiting and smoke from the satay!"
"The MRT map and the massive Marina Bay must have misled us, but this was one exhausting walk from the Marina Bay Sands and if you are with small children, do them a favor, hire a taxi and go there directly."
"Now this is surreal! Different certainly and an experience to behold. The colours are amazing. The plants varied and interesting if not native to Singapore but the odd touches of hot air balloons and biplanes dotted about are odd. The restaurant was poor - service, quality and choice but the biggest rip-off was the elevator to the walkway for the view. Not special but doesn't detract from the fun of the visit. A more serious bit was the threat to the planet: thought provoking if the facts are correct."
"I asked the person who was selling tickets what she would recommend since I didn't really google the attraction and she recommended ""Clouds."" I believed her. It was a disappointment because it was just some misty atmosphere that looked like a fog. It was very BORING. Every floor was the same. Nothing different. I think the flowers would have been better.The rain was pouring hard so it was not a really good time to be there. Probably if you don't have fog where you live, this will impress you. But not even my nieces were impressed and they live in Asia. I'm sure it was beautiful for those who saw the grandeur of the way it was set up. But I was bored. What is difficult is that I've seen beautiful places and nature and it's a bit difficult to satisfy me now."
"The first thing that i love about this place is the aircon.. Whether ure there at 1PM with a blazing heat from the sun you can still enjoy yourself there..On the ticket counter you can choose how many conservatory that you want to visit, i chose both conservatory with the price of SGD 28 for adult and SGD 15 for child..It was an overall pleasant experience, we can have a look at the falls, crystal mountain, etc and also the educational experience that the place has is also quite good.. The views were great though a bit too artificial to my liking..."
"As a youngster who are not that interested in garderns, i will not recommend to go there. But it has really spectacular view during evening when the trees are all lighted up. If you skip this then you are not missing on anything great. But if you go...treetop walk is a must..that is perhaps the best place in the garden."
The gardens by the bay is a visually impressive structure. With that being said everything to see is on the outside. The gardens themselves cost $23 to get in and are average at best. I recommend just going on the Singapore flyer and taking a picture of this at night. Oh and bring cash all of the restaurants didn't take credit cards.
"We took a ride to gardens by the bay from sentosa. Although this was a nice place, I think it was more foliage than floral. There were flowers there, but I was expecting spectacular. It's really nice and cool in the conservatories. It's worth a visit, but only once. It was also a little costly for the conservatories."
"As Singapore is devoid of all natural beauty this is the next best thing. It's a permanent exhibition of flora from around the world. There are 2 domes, the flower dome & cloud dome & if you only have time to see one the cloud dome was better. There's also the artificial Supertrees that puts on a light show at night. If you are wanting to catch a taxi from there it would be best to walk to the Marina Bay Sands hotel as taxis only go there if they are dropping visitors off."
"Visited the Gardens in early evening. It's good to be there around 6:30 pm that the sun is setting and the Gardens lights are being turned on. This the best enjoyable moment, watching the change of lightings on all the metal tree towers. Since it's only a short distance from the Sands, you always enjoy the Gardens' evening to its fullest before heading back to the night. We did spend time inside (where a fee applies), but a evening outside is good enough."
"This garden is a mockery to beautiful nature and a total rip-off. I enjoyed the mechanics of the buildings more than the garden itself. The entrance fee to the two Garden domes is $28 for tourists and $20 for citizens and PRs. Not bad, but not worth it. The cloud forest dome is ridiculously cold and I had rheumatism in my legs from the artificial cold and humidity. The flower dome is okay and there are many interesting species to see, but they are not set in a very natural setting. If you look at this place as a building with a garden, it's quite enjoyable. If you look at this place as a garden in a building, not so much. For those who prefer a ""sheltered"" nature experience, this is the place for you."
"Flower DomeThis man-made garden somehow reminds me of the world-famous Burchart Garden in Victoria, Canada. It is just amazing how the horticulturists in Singapore are able to set up an indoor garden full of exotic plants and flowers (mostly temperate) in a tropical country. These plants are mostly (if not fully) imported and transplanted from different continents around the world. There is a display of colourful floral arrangements as the centrepiece; you will also see several gigantic baobabs and centennial olive trees. I must say that the Californian Garden looks rather pathetic. Except for some dry and withering California lilacs, there is nothing much representing native Californian plants.Cloud ForestVisit this place if you would like to see some waterfall and tropical plants up-close without hiking up into a real forest.ConclusionThis tourist attraction probably serves its educational purposes well; but if you prefer somewhere spacious for the kids to relax and hang around a little longer, this might not be the right place for you. Visiting the Singapore Botanical Garden in late afternoon is a better bet. I personally prefer the latter as it looks and feels more ""natural"" with its tropical plants on a vast land. Be prepared to pay a hefty price to see these air-conditioned gardens that require constant care and high maintenance."
"Well, I did not know what to expect but not a Disneyesque botanical garden with weird, but strangely beautiful giant artificial trees that resembled Baobabs, and a rain cloud dome. The artificial trees were beautiful and you can actually go on a tree top walk for $5. The view up there is really great and it also gives you a different perspective. I am not sure that I would recommend this place for $28."
"When going to Singapore, Gardens by the bay its a must. Sea food was ok, but the whole experience its whats worth a shot! Amazing artificial gardens welcome you to the restaurant, that even when artifical you feel like in a real forrest.Service was great, prices were good and food ( as almost everything in Singapore) was pretty good....just had better in some other places! ( watch other reviews)"
"It is just a large green house. In other parts of the world you would get this surroundings for free. Price too steep. Well if you are a tourist, wouldn't mind visiting once"
"I did not like this too much . it was something we did as we had time at night. I think if you do the flyer at night, you could have a nice view from there."
"I found the place very commercial, a lot of the plants were dying in the atriums which was sad. It was good to go once but I won't be rushing back, Even though I got a discount because I'm a resident in Singapore, I thought it was pretty expensive."
"If you are in the area and have nothing to do, it's ok to just spend a couple of hours here.And once you enter they charge you for everything like going up, there are some gardens in some shell like looking structures where they are growing plants of all types.Nothing impressive. Only nice thing I found was a good view of the towers across the street..."
"The Gardens By the Bay is a nice place to visit. But I have to say, I was a bit disappointed.The waterfall is great and I liked the water spraying when they generate the tropical environment."
"The now days Singapore got few modern and unique architecture landmark and buildings. Gardens by the Bay, the SuperTree will definitely in the list.It is actually no far from Sands Marina Bays. The best way to visit is from the shopping mall go to the root floor, and from there got link sky bridge to Sands Marina Bays and from there to reach Gardens by the Bays. Since it is straight line, cut short the road. Alternatively you can use subway with all the air con, walk from underground.Only premises here that charge is the indoor tropical forest and flowers dome nearby. if you like tropical forest and flowers can visit."
"The free garden is very standard & because of they are new, it looked barren. I think night visit will be better.I must around SGD 35 to enter the cloud forrest & flower dome.Flower Dome : Quite good, cool air & many photo spotCloud Forest : nothing special, cool air & limited photo spot."
I came for a lazy afternoon to relax. Having previously already spent a lot of money I was interested in laying to go into any of the attractions as I'm not that into flowers and whatnot. But the outside gardens which are free we're tranquil and peaceful. Great place to relax and think in such a busy city
"I think it's a good place to bring old people and kids. For kids, they can learn about plants and climates, and for seniors, they can enjoy the view and the cold breeze especially in the cloud forest.This is a bit expensive, but if you stay on MBS or flight with SQ, you can get 10% discount from the normal ticket."
Not realy into gardening so probably a bit of a waste to show me but spectacular in its own way if you like plants and flowers you will love this
"This park is nice, but it is a bit over-done. If you enjoy a more natural feel, go to Fort Canning or the Botanic Gardens. This is more like a created nature-park. It is definitely beautiful, but I would not make this a must-see visit."
Gardens by the Bay are an interesting engineering feat. The Super Trees are a clever design feature. The gardens arebcery well maintained but a little too clinical for my liking. I prefer a more natural garden setting.The restaurants inside the garden are very good. We also went up to the top of a Super Tree for a drink and to see the view. Expensive but worthwhile.It is free to walk around the garden with entrees fees charged to go onto the orchid dome. My favourite experience was the sculpture of the big baby in the field.Lots of photo opportunities of the Sands hotel from the gardens.
"It felt like you were miles away from the hubbub of the city centre, a different world apart. Great free thing for everyone to do. I found it by accident - I wanted to walk near the waterfront and found lots of posters hanging from street lighting advertising the gardens by the bay. There are a lot of free parts of the garden to look round, but you can also buy tickets for separate areas like the inside botanicals, and for super tree - walk at same height or just below the tall trees and get a different view of the gardens and I presume the surrounding area. My favourite area was the Colonial area where there was info on loads of spices brought over and what influence they had on Singapore like peppercorn (the term peppercorn rent comes from people using peppercorn as a type of currency back in the day, and people used to have sacks of peppercorn in their houses), also learning about what different herbs mean to Chinese medicines and Hinduism.-A couple of nice metalic sculptures around too like giant dragonfly in the water.-Nice surrounding area like the arts and science museum (didn't go in but impressive building from the outside), a fancy shopping mall which enables you to go right up to the top gardens for a small fee, and the helix bridge - the whole area is recently done up"
I salute to their effort in making this garden. But i was not amazed. Views inside the Flower Dome and The Cloud Forest were nice but nothing special for me not worth the fee. Maybe if they could lower down the fee a bit then its ok.
"We stopped in just to get a good look at the ""Avatar trees"" as my friend called them. I thought they were quite interesting and rather pretty. I didn't go into the conservatories, but did think that the trees were worth a quick stop. Not sure I would've bothered if we hadn't been driving, though, as you can see the trees from a distance. One if the prettier sites I visited, actually.We had borrowed a vehicle that day, so be aware they charge parking by the minute. Also, saw lots of cranky kids at the gardens that night. I think parents wanted to see the trees but since it has to be after dark the kids just weren't into it and needed a nap. For little kids, it probably isn't really that interesting!"
"The cloud forest is quite nice, with waterfall and a good educational tour for young children. The plants and the dome is well organized. The Flower Dome is a total waste of time and money."
"We visited the Supertree gardens. They are impressive from far away and up close. But, once we saw them, there wasn't much else to do. We visited during the day. There were some nice paths to wonder, but the attraction was super crowded. I suspect that there might be more going on at night."
The super trees are amazing. A feat of engineering. The skywalk between trees offers great views for 5$. Unfortunately not everyone can afford 28$ for the cloud and flower domes.
"Before I went to Singapore, seeing many reviewers' photos about this metal structures, I thought it was something worth visiting, but after we got close, it really did not grab me as I hope, although I still admire the architure of the structure.The only highlight, I enjoyed inside this park was the full view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and there is this huge stone carved buddha, with a very joyful expression, sitting under the tree close to the entrance of the Garden, which very pleasant to look at.In my humble opinion, this Gardens by the Bay looks so young and things seem to just scatter around in compare to the mature and nicely landscaped Orchid Garden."
"The Cloud Forest was nicely built and it was nice to walk around it. Especially to see the big waterfall. The other part where they had nothing but flowers was a little boring. Would recommend going to see the huge flower displays that are outside, they look nice especially in the evening. I don't think the Cloud Forest was worth as much money as the entrance fee cost."
"Two years ago when we visited the Botanic Gardens, quite away out of Singapore, the Bay Gardens where under construction. In May 2013 we visited the Bay Gardens and whilst all the plantings are not mature the design is very impressive. The 65M waterfall in the Temperate Zone glass house was spectacular. The orchids and flowers here are just as beautiful! Bay Gardens is only 10 minutes by train from Orchard Rd and has a spectacular Casino/Hotel complex with rooftop pool and gardens about 50 floors up just above the station. Plenty of options to fill our day in the area."
"Look, there's no doubt this is as beautiful place to visit, but is the price justified? I'm not sure.If you love looking at gardens or flowers you should definitely stop by here. My Nana would be in heaven,As a couple in our 20s we found that most people here were older or with families and there's a reason for it. Its nice, but its just not that exciting.I think it's worth coming here to look at the free gardens outside, but I wouldn't really recommend this experience to friends."
Singapore is famous for its reclaimed land. This gardens now sits where a few years ago was the see. It is impressive.. But it is not my favorite place in Singapore. It doesn't have the charm of the botanic gardens. Built too much like an attraction park.
"Visit started with lunch at Majestic By The Bay. Reserved the table - they were strict - had to fit into their slots of either 11:30am or 1:30pm, and told that they would hold table for only 5 minutes (this is not very friendly). Had dim sum and dishes - they had 'run out' of chicken by our 11:30am lunch (!). Overall, was a pleasant meal for our 4 adults 3 kids. Lobster porridge was a highlight.Ticketing experience was horrible. After reaching the counter after the queue, was told that I had to show them the ID of all adults (family was having lunch downstairs at the Majestic!)!. Totally inflexible and I had to leave the counter without tickets as I had only my ID with me. I can understand they had 2 prices - a cheaper one for Singaporeans and residents, and a higher price for foreigners - but they have to think of a way to make the ticket purchase experience more friendly. [Had gone to their website for online purchase earlier in the day, but the system did not work.]Flower Dome was not much of a blast for me. Cloud Forest was good - highlight being the waterfall and misty atmosphere.Took an awfully long (and hot) walk to Supertree Dining, but was quite disappointed with the selection there. We had wanted ice cream and coffee - which was not to be found [we settled for Texas Chicken's sundaes]."
"we did not visit the whole place, went by buggy from place close to Sands to the ticket booth. As it was already quite late in the day, we just went to Cloud Forest Dome. We got some reduction as we could show we were flying Singapore Airlines. You enter huge dome with large waterfall which makes for nice pictures. You go up with elevator to top nd then graduallycome down. People scared of heights may have some unease about the walkways winding down. overall nice picture possibilities (also of Sands hotel), but not that much that blew us away. It is amazing what you cna do in Singapore in different areas, and this is definitely an addition to the offer, but we were more impressed by architecture and general concept of the project, than this specific dome."
"It was OK, expensive for what it was. The cloud walk was the best part, however it had a fake feel about it......., to be honest a walk through the Botanic Gardens would be equally as pleasant??Perhaps coming from Qld where rainforests are not new to us took away the wow factor? There were no birds, butterflys....I did hear some taped bird noises....just didn't wow us"
"nice garden, but I have not had time to see everything. The two exhibitions were great, but too expensive"
the Gardens by the Bay are an extraordinary feat of engineering. It does feel like a plant theme park. It does get very hot there as it is much more exposed to the sun than the Botanical Gardens. If you like the quiet and charm of the Botanical Gardens this place will feel alien. It is fascinating to see but I won't be returning for a second visit.
Caught a taxi there as it is a distance from the MRT. We did a shuttle tour which was great but as the gardens are vast we were not sure if there was a shuttle or not that we could get on so we walked. The information desk is so keen on getting people through that they do not explain and we had to search for a map.The gardens are very new and some parts kitsch. In retrospect we should have gone to the more established orchid garden or botanical gardens
It's just like a park with some attractions (that you have to pay). I didn't feel it's worth the money so I just walked around.
Attractions Cloud forest and flower dome are worth visiting; you will get a very good view of singapore flyer and marina bay sands
"The gardens sound wonderful but found the exhibits in the rainforest hall very tired an sickly, not sure whyOtherwise great concept and should be fantastic in a few years as plants develop"
"Went here just to accompanied my husband, who wants to take pictures while the supertrees' lights on.Didn't attract me to visit all the specific gardens around, because where I come from, those plants are just plants that I can see everyday, moreover I don't like the climate, very hot and humid.Tumbs up just for the garden experts who designed Garden's by The Bay, that's just it."
"Gardens by the Bay is a great place to go jogging her for a walk if you're in Singapore, but it's touristic value is not very high.Gardens by the Bay is kind of in the middle of nowhere. That would make sense, since Singapore is an island country and had to dredge up the land from the sea, but at same time, there is an MRT station relatively near. There are wide paths for biking and jogging, which is really helpful in such a cramped city in an urban atmosphere.The two times I've been here, there it has been packed with tourists, but I don't really know why. To get to the jungle bridges connecting the trees, you have to pay for that. That was kind of a letdown, but it would make sense that it sponsored by a bank. :)Overall, Gardens by the Bay is good for a stroll in the city after eating in one of the great food courts!"
"The gardens are yet another piece of beauty in Singapore but with absolutely no meaning, substance. There is shallow depiction of chinese, indonesian, malayan, indian gardens. The Indian map for food is also inaccurate. Well manicured gardens and over the top monstrosities that houses a rainforest. Almost everything is an award winning structure. It speaks volumes of Singapore's attempt to create on their land all that they lack and make money out of it."
The presence of nature all around you is something that entices you in this place. There a slight feel of artificiality in the place but never mind that. There are the two gardens here.The Cloud garden is very breat taking with an entry which has a huge artificial waterfall. The lights are another feature that add value. This garden is a bit cold. The mist from the waterfall also makes this look gorgeous. The walkway from the top is a good walk.The Flower Garden is all about sheer beauty of Flowers and botanic creations from different regions in the world. The place can easily be a romantic get away. The exit gate of this garden directly takes you to the bay side walk which again is very romantic.
I was not very impressed by the gardens. Maybe because they are newly open the plants are quite small and look like it is going to be a great place in couple of years. Nice to see but won't return for next couple of years. For now I prefer Botanic Gardens.
Maybe it is just me... It is hot and not much of recreation. It is just boring. It is also difficult to find a seat for a meal in the restaurant.
"It is understandable that a modern and rich community lacking some real history and sense of the past, needs to show off permanently. Money can make many things and what they did here is impressive indeed. Another tourist attraction a little pseudo educational and Dysneyland style.This said the architecture of the greenhouses is impressive and the trees surreal.To avoid a heathstroke visit at night when they are closed to the public- privately and free of charge - after an excellent dinner at Pollen where you will be actually in the chilly Mediterranean greenhouse."
"This will be a great place in a few years once things grow more.Yes, its worth the look now, there is plenty to see, and some lovely attractions to view, but in a few years it will be great.The entry to the gardens is free, so a cheap wander about is available, however, the attractions inside have an entry fee.The gardens stay open till 2am for night owls to visit, but the attractions close at 9pm with the last entry at 8.30pm. There are places to eat inside the gardens.It was very pleasant wandering about in the cooler evening but would expect it to get very hot on a sunny Singapore day.If staying at MBS the access to the gardens is a little complicated."
"This is a model of sustainability in the somewhat sterile newly built hotel/mall/gardens area of Singapore.Unusual in that there are large metal structures modeled after the rainforest canopy.Very well kept up with appealing gardens and nice views of the bay, hotels.Interesting but not necessarily a ""must see"".Free but some fees for selected venues."
"Given the publicity, many tourist would be rushing to satisfy their curiosity in this huge empty park littled with serveral Giant Super Trees which are the only man-made elements unique in this park. Trees are too small to offer adequate shade as compared to the Botanic Gardens or other parks in the world. There is also hardly any placed to shelter from the rain. However, the best time to imerse in the ambience of lights is during sunset where 2 light-shows accompanies the setting sun. One at 7.45pm and the other an hour later. The Super Tree by Indochine restaurant is worth a visit where one can experience a panoramic view of the city on the 4th level rotating outdoor bar (alas the rollers were not yet functional at the point of my visit in March'13). I probably won't return within a short while till the trees grow bigger :lol)"
"I went here a few months ago in the morning to afternoon with my grandmother. It was a pleasant experience taking pictures everywhere. However when it was lunch time, the food there was really expensive.2 tips, go at night, it is a lot nicer with the lights and all. For the food, i have recently came across this site called Changi recommends and realise they have discounts for food! i will go there again and try out this offer."
It cost over SGD$20 to access the two domes. It is over priced and not worth the money. Outdoor is free but not much to see. Best go at night time as it is too hot during the day!
"We started in the Flower dome and the was the best of the 2 domes in my opinion. We would have been inside the flower dome for 2.5 hours as it is easy to walk around and view the various flowers and so much more from all around the world. It is cool so some people who are sensitive to cool temperature might want to bring a light jacket or sweater. There is a restaurant in the Flower Dome that has $35 hamburgers too rich for my blood! I would recommend to bring a lunch or eat at the Bakerzin which is out in the lobby area between the 2 domes. They have a limited menu but an excellent burger for $18 which seems cheap after the $35 one inside the dome. I mention the food only because you can spend so much time in each dome you are bound to be hungry and there are limited, very limited choices to eat. The Cloud Forest has a water fall as you walk in the door and is can be a bit chilly. This dome takes a good 2 hours to fully enjoy all that is inside. If you go you will enjoy. Signage for where to enter could be improved as we came in by public transportation and had to walk a short distance. Several groups of people including my group went the wrong way at first and had to back track to the entrance."
"This attraction has 3 parts. The best is the basic garden that has plants from all over the world in a kind of biosphere environment. The second is a sort of strange environment which is a mountainous tropical theme and is not as effective. This is not for anyone that is bothered by heights, there are some very exposed narrow walkways. The last we did not go on, but is even worse for those that do not like heights. All in all the Botanical Orchid Garden is a much better bet and it's free."
"Slightly overrated and overprized, however in general nice and funny to see once. However there are some nicer places in Singapore, just go and visit the gardens, it is not needed to go to the payed areas."
After watching better homes and gardens I was very excited to see these garden. I actually didn't watch the episode because I didn't want to be disappointed when I went. But unfortunately I was. The gardens are beautiful but for all the hype a I felt it fell flat. It is my opinion that the gardens lack a personality it felt sterile.
"The most impressive thing here is the futuristic construction; the actual contents are a little underwhelming. Yes, there are plenty of attractive flowers and exotic plants, and a clever reconstruction of a cloud forest, but there is always the nagging doubt as to what is real and what is not. Unusually for Singapore, public transport access is not very convenient, so be prepared to get a taxi, or get hot and sticky."
I prefer visiting at night because at night more cooling and lighting look beautiful compare visit in the morning. if you don't mind hot weather actually still not so bad. The food there expensive and not really taste fantasy. sorry hope no offence.
"Singapore is a small city so you can't expect a lot of scenic views (even if they are artificially set up). In my opinion the place is too crowded hence I couldn't enjoy having a peaceful stroll in the park or taking photos. It may be because at the time I visited the place it had just been opened, so tourists flooded to the garden.It is within waking distance from Marina Bay Sands and there are two main green houses apart from the usual park. I paid $40 for two entrances and the houses inside are quite nice. One house has a lot of flowers (from all over the world) and the other has a mountain structure where you can walk up high and have a bird-eye view.It could have been a more enjoyable visit if there had not been too many visitors."
"As the title says, avoid the mid-day (about 11am-3pm) depending on weather conditions, its a great break away from the casino and urbane shopping area.Singapore trying to be a ""City in the Garden"" or the other way round ""Garden in a City"" (could not make up its mind) always tries. But GBB is a very rushed development by the same ministry that runs the country's asthetic infrastructures and its many parks.This is a basically man made garden that is south of the CBD and the new MBS or MBFC (Marina Bay Financial Centre) and the whole plot sits on reclaimed land, just beside the sea!There are two huge garden theme domes, and each has its unique features. Entry to either of these domes are payable, about $12 each, $20/pax for going for both.I gave an average rating because if you really like gardens, Singapore's Botanical Gardens with rich history and natural blooms, beats GBB hands down!! Everything is so man-made and concrete here, but it will improve over the years!!Go to its official website and everything is there - http://www.gardensbythebay.com.sg/en/home.htmlThanks for reading!!"
I actually got a creepy feeling here...kind of sci-fi...would skip this attraction on my next visit to Singapore.
"Nice design, but prepare for the heat if you plan to walk around outside. Gardens are still getting established and it's not as dense and lush as some of the older gardens in Singapore."
"We visited the gardens in February this year, our initial thoughts were that the gardens felt like a theme park with wide walkways and overly manicured gardens. It felt very man made. That been said it was an interesting place to visit and still very beautiful.Visitors coming via MRT (Bayfront MRT station) must walk for approx 15-20mins before arriving at the ticketing area of the conservatory.There are two air-conditioned conservatory ""Flower Dome"" and ""Cloud Forest""We were impressed by the Cloud Forest but less impressed by the Flower DomeThe Flower Dome includes gardens from around the world. There is a big function hall to rent we commented that if you planned to get married in Singapore that would be a very beautiful place to hold your wedding reception.Cloud Forest: this conservatory took inspiration from Southeast Asia's lush rainforest. You are welcomed by a five story waterfall, you then take a lift to the top floor and slowly make your way down the walkways exiting at the bottom. The hanging walkway is great for taking photos. On the lower level is the ""theatre"" offering free show about global warming and the effect on nature. The temperature inside this cloud forest is cooler with higher humidity than the flower dome.From the domes if you exit at the back and take the elevators down you can walk up to a newly developed hawker centre and have satay - much cheaper than the food outlets in the gardens and a bit more real."
"The garden is new and the plants just need a bit of time to establish.The enclosures are fantastic, and beautiful display and collection of plants."
"try the skyway,great view to see mbs and singapore flyer .. the park is big,so make sure got more time here"
"Singapore is always on the move and this attraction is relatively new, with the site still being developed. It did not have the ""wow"" factor for us and perhaps is over-priced. Better to go to the Botanic Gardens."
"the gardens look interesting from the outside, especially from marina bay sands at night. but when we visited in the daytime we didnt think there was anything special about the place. the idea of the huge trees is cool. but you end up walking in the sun most of the time: until now there is not much shade (the plants they planted to cover the ceilings are still growing) and the park is too artificial for my taste."
"artificial, as is with most things in Singapore.The flower dome reminded me (very much) of Butchart Gardens on Vancouver Island.As you enter the cloud forest, there is the huge waterfall. If you look up, you will also see the pipes/vents (quite hideous, although they tried to paint it green to camouflage it). I do think that the vines and creepers will eventually cover them, but they didn't look very nice when I was there the last time.On the plus side, it's a great idea - I'm all for gardens and greenery and nature. And you do get to see a wide variety of flora in one place.They also have a audio guide, so that can be quite educational.It's nice and cool (even cold, at times - although ""cold"" is relative, I know)."
Its all about nature and its facts. if you love that then its for u. Do get a headset that will guide you through the tour
"We had high expectations on the Gardens by the Bay after seeing the Marina Bay Sands and its surroundings. The Gardens are somewhat nice, but seem incomplete, like if they need a couple more years of growing plants all over the place to look really organic. The vast concrete walkways disturb the picture of a botanic garden, and the supertrees are more scaffold than plant. Everything looks promising, but not yet convincing - also the link between the plants and the information that is provided on several panels seems missing (yet). We did not enter the domes, because they did not seem worth the high price."
"We walked from bayfront mrt toward the garden by the bay... The garden is big and spacious.The landscape layout is great, with dragonfly pond, super trees and the side way along the domes..The lighting in the night is dim and can be diffcult see the paveway at night..the lighting along the pond can be brighter...i also noticed the lift, near the supertree leading the mrt seem to be the commonly used way . Hope to have a slope at the same area to ease the use of lift . The lift is slow and packed with people...The flower dome is spacious and nice and cool and clean.. Not pack, we can roam around easily and take our time to appreciate the flowers.but the quanity of flowers are not a lot ... well maybe my timing is after chinese new year, the decoration and flowers has died...The cloud dome waterfall is wonderful, very wet and the mist effect was interesting for my kids.. they enjoyed very much ... the treetop was ok .nothing much to see in the dome while at the top but you can see the singapore sights outside the dome..."
"hot, so you better prepare umbrella before going there. I wnet there about 9 but it was already hot. or go there in the evening.the garden is beautiful, take some hour to explore this place"
"Gardens by the Bay is very impressive in the educational aspect as well as design, but I didn't feel it was very good value for money at over SGD50 for two people.Maybe it's because I live in Australia and we have really fantastic Botanical Gardens for free, the Flower Dome seemed somewhat disappointing. Split out into different countries/regions, the plants were put together somewhat haphazardly (some just in pots clumped together) and they weren't very well signposted. Still, it was very clever the way the dome was designed to cater for different climates of the various regions. We visited before Chinese New Year, and Year of The Snake decorations were scattered around the garden, which was very nice.The Cloud Dome was nice, even though my first impressions of the man-made waterfall was that it looked like a couple of drainpipes over a carpark! But, when we started to explore, it was interesting to see the different levels of a forest canopy and the walkways were fun.What I especially liked were the environmental education activities and information. It would be good to take children there so they could learn about sustainability. It was also a really nice cool place to visit on a hot day.I did find the super trees outside to be really impressive, although we didn't do the skywalk.All in all, it's a nice place to visit."
"Beautifull designed gardens, you can visit them by walking over the bridge, also taking te little train to go aroung. See those nice trees on cellpower. The best is to go up the Marina Bay Hotel and see the garden from the rooftop!"
"Singapore does things as well as any one can but this attraction is not really worth the time spent there. Great architecture, probably a really good idea but unless you come from sea level in the tropics you will have seen many of the exhibits is a botanical garden somewhere in the world."
"Please allocate around 3 hours if you plan to visit both the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest, the 2 conservatories which charge admission. If you only have time for 1, the Cloud Forest is more natural. There are water coolers at the entrance. The plus points are both conservatories are fully air conditioned, and sheltered from rain. Take a cap along if you would like to shield yourself from the sun from the mrt station to the conservatories as the path is not covered. The palms and fir do not seem to be doing so well (same as the possums in the Night Safari) outside their natural habitat as much as one tries to simulates the environment. The flower garden is quite colorful in the flower dome. The waterfall in the Cloud Forest is quite impressive when you enter the conservatory. The Secret Garden display is quite nicely done informing visitors how the gardens are maintained. The admission prices is quite steep compared to the free entry lovely Botanical Gardens which has thriving plants. Maybe someone should look into the information put up in the Indian garden exhibit, it seems to be not quite right. Once you exit from one conservatory, you cannot go back inside so plan your time there carefully i.e. eat before you go in."
"Other than the Cloud Forest Dome, I was disappointed with this attraction. The various gardens (Colonial, Malay, Chinese etc) were either unfinished or uninspiring. Perhaps when the garden is more mature, it will be worthwhile for a visit. If you have time for one garden in Singapore, I would pick the Botanical Garden over this any time."
we only went to the supertrees and cloud forest because flower dome is closed on maintenance. lack of plants variety but the architecture is very amazing. fantastic view and frames to the singapore flyer and marina bay sands. the other area seems hasn't been complete yet.
"Getting There:Take Circle line Mrt to BayFront from Promenade or From Marinabay take the Bayfront link, one stop away. You can ask for a MRT map from any of the stations, free of charge from the ticket counter. In Bayfront MRT station: This station is connected to the B1 of Marina Bay Sands, Integrated Resort Hotel, so you can choose to exit to your right and walk the long tunnel to Garden By the Bay.Take bus 133, from Bugis or 106 from Dhobyghaut alight at Marina Bay Sands Bus stop. Turn to your left, you will find elevator and take to level 6, called Lion bridge and proceed to your left to garden by the bay. You will pass through the MBS hotel and exit out towards the garden.By Walk: If you are walking from the Promenade, cross the road opp Ritz Carlton and take up the Helix bridge, its spiral in nature and an engineering class. Get down on your left hand side staircase and walk towards the Garden by the Bay. Of all the routes, shortest walk to Information counter and Ticket booth at garden by the bay is through the boardwalk near the Helix bridge.In the Garden: Through MRT Tunnel or Lion Bridge, you will come across the Dragon Fly Lake. There are 2 sculptures at the water which is quite stunning. Spend some time for photographs and you can also have a peek through mounted cameras. Unique thing is, whatever you aim at, there is already a description of what you are looking at, on the screen. Take the Dragonfly bridge over the lake, and there is an Information counter. Take brochures and also glance at videos of how things are done and made at Garden by the bay. Friendly staffs will assist to your queries. You can also get some drinks and ice cream from the golf buggy, thats parked on route to the Chinese garden. Chinese garden symbolizes with the garden tradition of chinese culture. With pebble laden foot path and some sculptures that soar high as 10 feet with trees and plants. Cross further into Indian garden. The floor is hexagonal design with intricate lines, trees and terracota horses, that are unique symbol of indian civilization. There are some info about the gardens near the counters as well.. Exit and turn to your left is the Information Counter. For those who choose to walk via the Helix Bridge towards GTB, walk straight to the super domes and take escalator to level 1, you will reach Information Counter. There is also a Malay garden, that symbolizes the Malay culture located near to the super grove trees opp food courtWhat It Offers?: two conservatories, that is home to tropical plants and trees. Entry fee is imposed. Senior citizen and children concession are available. The flower Dome, has a Michelin chef star rated restaurant located inside. Entry fee to the OCBC Skywalk, a suspension bridge between super grove trees, that offers you 360 degree view of the garden, river and marina bay sands. For elderly people and pregnant ladies, use the garden cruiser to get you around the gardens. Its 5$ per person.Restaurants: There are lot of private restaurants in and around information counter, which are bit pricey. We preferred to goto the food court located near the OCBC Skywalk. From the Info counter, walk straight towards the taxi stand and turn right near the small conceirge to the elevators. There is collection of western food, traditional chinese food, pizza and pasta shop, coffe shop. Prices are average and choices limited.Garden Signatures: Everywhere you walk and see, you will find varieties of orchids smiling at you, some fruit trees, rows of sugarcanes near the drangon fly lake, the Artificial super grove trees are quite tall, with orchids, flowers and climbers, covering them like second skin with sprinklers sticking out. Its quite a sight to see, when sprinklers work, during early morning hours. Opposite the Skywalk you will find 2 sets of lion heads on the wall, with water flowing through their mouths, exactly to the gap on the floor below. The boardwalks near the lake is quite relaxing. The Gift shop at Garens are very unique. I have never seen such collection of jewelleries, souvenir's, tea's (yes, they taste good and try the demo), handicrafts and memorabilia's at affordable prices. Recently, the restaurant is open on top of the supergrove tree near to the dragon fly lake. There is a small beach setting near to the river side, closer to the Marina Bay Sands area, which looks different to the garden theme.Best Time: Before 9 am in the morning or after 3 pm in the afternoon. On a cloudy day, can even go as early as 10 am. Advisable not to go after 10 am on a hot sunny day, specially if you are a newbee and dont know the routes well, you will be cursing just to find the Information counter walking a long way in hot sun, as there are no sunshades along the footpath anywhere in the garden. Wear comfortable flat shoes or flip flops, ladies avoid high heeled shoes, as you will be carrying them in your hands after some time. Keep umbrellas with you. note rest rooms are near the Info counter at landing of dragon fly bridge and then at the Main information counter, and at the food court. Please carry a water bottle in hand, as there are no water taps located along the path. You can also take taxi from the taxi driveway located adjacent to the information counter. On weekends, its quite crowded, so stroll towards the helix bridge near Marina Bay Sands and after you cross the first set of Ayer rajah highway bridge, there is a small lane to Tower 3 driveway of the MBS hotel and you get a taxi there easily.Pros of the Garden: Unique flora settings, super grove trees, lush & different varieties of flowers and plants, good scenic and photograpic places. The theme and the logo dragonfly will be seen everywhere, including well maintained rest rooms.Cons: pricey restaurants, signanges along the routes needs precised informations (E.g -walk to information counter/ticket booth 1 km ), Maps along the path to guide you. No Water taps along the foot path, rest room availability at other location.Verdict: A must place for people with passion towards the nature. For locals, well you can try different aspect lesuirely at various times, since there is no entry fee or time restriction as garden is open 22 hrs everyday. For Tourists, if it fits your time and schedule, DONT MISS IT."
"I guess it is still under construction, which is why the Gardens by the Bay seem more like an artificial concrete structure rather than a plant garden. The gardens were not special, there were mosquitoes everywhere, and the whole place was hot and humid. Perhaps it would help if they added more shaded areas where people can sit and rest while strolling. The super trees were interesting but nothing special. The views were nice, though. Adding more flowering plants and more rest areas would make the place nicer to visit, in my opinion."
Didnt find the experience as edutaining as advertised . Though big trees are fascinating site to watch but that is where it all ends.
After seeing the Botanic Gardens we were really excited to go to Gardens by the Bay. What a disappointment. The plants just didn't look that healthy and for the price it wasn't worth it.
"do try to visit this place at night, when the Supertrees are lit up in full splendour. strolls on the paved walkways make for romantic dates, and the view of the Singapore skyline is also fabulous."
"I'm not one for heights and unfortunately most of the cloud forest is spent walking around and down a walkway very high up (about 6 stories). The walkway has grill mesh on either side so you can see the ground under your feet. The waterfall inside is fantastic. The Flower Dome was ok, some of the plants looked a bit sick."
"Gardens By The Bay, being one of the newer additions to the attractions in Singapore, captures the government's effort in further maintaining Singapore's title as a ""Garden City"". The garden itself is free entry however, you will have to pay a fee of SGD$28 standard admission to the two indoor conservatory domes - Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. In addition, the OCBC Skyway cost SGD$5 per adult in order to enter. The entrance ticket to the two domes are rather expensive in my opinion, but your trip will definitely not be complete without exploring the domes!Personally prefer the Cloud Forest (moist) as compared to Flower Dome (dry), based on individual preferences. The main feature of the Cloud Forest will have to be the waterfall area, in addition, the domes are a good place to escape from the heat at the gardens since temperature are kept cooling in the dome. On the other hand, Flower Dome pales as compared to the Cloud Forest. It has interesting flower displays though which will change accordingly to seasons.If you're intending to make a trip to the Gardens By The Bay, remember to wear light clothings especially if you're planning to go there in the afternoon! The heat can get unbearable at times. Of course, I would suggest going during the evening time as it will be much more cooling and the view will be more magnificent with the lightings as well.."
"Overall I was disappointed and I wouldn't recommend it until you have seen other Singapore attractions.I have been to Singapore a number of times and the zoo and bird park are my favourite places and I have been to each several times.I wanted to see something different.The photos of Gardens by the Bay look impressive.I knew it was going to storm and the fact there are two enormous glasshouses undercover swayed me to visit this attraction.It is newish and still under development, the outside gardens are not finished.To save time and energy we caught taxis to and from the Gardens from our hotel (York Hotel).The entrry fee is expensive , 28SGD to visit both domes.There is a 10% discount if you hold Singapore Airlines or Silkair boarding passes.It is cheaper for Singapore residents.The Cloud Forest was good and worth seeing.There were lots of beautiful plants, a waterfall and an interesting display of stalactites you could inspect very close up.Men were cleaning the glass dome and watching them abseil was an added interest.The Flower Dome was a big disappointment.They have an excellent, large selection of cacti for those interested in cacti.Some old,knarled olive trees were interesting.There were some roses, not at their best and a Christmas display featuring poinsettias, also past its best. As an Australian, the large range of native Australian plants did not interest me.We did a quick walk around the outside gardens which are not yet established.Maybe I will go back in a few years time.There were some huge petrified tree trunks that were interesting.The light show was a disappointment although the music was quite nice and reminded us of the movie Avatar.Overall, I wouldn't recommend it but it is an attraction that can be visited in the rain."
"We walked from the Singapore Flyer to Gardens By The Bay hoping to see beautiful orchids but were disappointed. The Cloud Pavilion was much better than the Flower Pavilion. Getting away from the place at closing time in the rain was also rather difficult. The queue for taxis was enormous. We walked down to the road, caught a local bus and then train. The locals were wonderfully helpful in getting us sorted with the public transport."
"Gardens by the Bay....just a short walk to marina bay sands. The surrounding gardens are free of charge...you could do your picnic or sightseeing here...to enter the 2 giant iconic buildings: Flower Dome & Cloud Forest, you have to pay. The ticket is rather pricey and for foreigners, you have to buy both, can not just choose one. Flower Dome is a place where there are plants...that basically it. Nothing much to see...sorry to say, since I am not a big fun of plants. For Cloud Forest, not so bad, when entering the area, the waterfalls will be the 1st thing we see, this Cloud Forest is more interesting...the area is cool and had a number of nice pictures spots. We will be like doing a little hiking and see the nice views surrounding. The construction of the buildings are amazing...very nice architecture. We visited the Gardens during the day, climbed to the Super Tree..extra charge around SGD3/person. Conclusion...one visit is enough."
"Mostly undercover. Nice for a casual walk around and trees are linked by high walk bridge. Nice area and good use of reclaimed land but wouldn't put at top of the list of things to do in Singapore. Dont waste time with going to Indochine Supertree restaurant, just enjoy the gardens"
"Nice place to stroll around in the evenings, but can get quite warm/humid during the day. The outdoor park is free of charge, whereas the indoors (""Flower Dome"" and ""Cloud Forest"") have a fee, however, should be visited."
"The conservatories are expensive and considering there needs to be several more years for them to reach their growth, do not be disappointed, but ins saying that the gardens are going to be spectacular in the future and the skywalk is amazing and a must do, however Singapore needs to stop charging so much!!!"
"Its definitely worth a visit even if you are not a nature lover. There is a lot of things to ""see"" and could easily occupy an entire day - you could pick and chose which ones to visit. Most of the areas are free and you could stroll in and out. Two attractions are paid: The Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. Buy tickets online - 10% cheaper till some time in Jan 2013. Check before you go. Cloud Forest is a must go and is a wonderful experience - even more so if you didnt know what it was and strolled in. Its the thing to see in the gardens. Flower Dome was disappointing. The photos seemed to overstate the vibrancy and colors and we expected a ""field of colors"" but saw trickles.Super tree grove is also engaging in its concept and design and the little bridge walk is refreshing with awesome views of the Marina Bay Sands and Singapore flyer."
"Gardens by the Bay came highly recommended to us on our recent visit to Singapore. Perhaps we visited the wrong time in the day - we went in the morning and I heard it is better at night - it was disappointing. The setting is very futuristic. If the movie Bladerunner featured a garden, it would look like this. In fact, there is a scene from Serenity that looked just like it. Novel and interesting perhaps, but it doesn't stir the soul. Or, I should say, it stirs the soul wrong. The word cold comes to mind. The other beef I had with this garden was that the signs were confusing. If you have time for only one garden in Singapore, go to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. There you can see real, old growth trees (rather than the interesting but monstrous fake tree). There, you can imagine what the island used to look like. The Botanic Gardens is charming. And it felt authentic."
"We were interested to see this place however were somewhat disappointed in the variety of flowers and plants. We expected quite a bit of colour and vibrancy. I guess we have some amazing gardensin Australia, so I may have been comparing. If you are from Singapore , or other parts of the world with limited garden areas, this attraction would be stunning for you. The fake waterfall, while large in structure, was not particularly exciting for us as in Australia we have real waterfalls which are bigger and far more beautiful. We have local garden nurseries which are more spectacular. I did however appreciate the climate education and awareness campaign going on there and I think this could be a really exciting approach if taken further. In the meantime, perhaps the designers could consider highlighting the beautiful varieties of orchids, so common in this part of Asia. We were disappointed that they weren't throughout the exhibits.I think in a year or two this place could be quite spectacular once things have grown to potential and once they harness what the actual purpose of the attraction is."
"This is a nice green area for an urban centre to enjoy, but if you are from areas with decent parks this is not particularly interesting - other than the man made elements. Of the two biospheres that you pay to enter, the cloud forest is not like a cloud forest at all. The other one had some really cool baobabs and cacti. If you're interested from a botanical standpoint, go to the botanic gardens instead."
"I organized a trip for a bus load of 40 pax to the Gardens By The Bay. The 2 domes were nothing to rave about as what we did was just follow the crowd and walked along the one way path. There were hardly any colorful flowers, just plants and plants. Nothing for us to be excited about taking photos with.I arranged the bus to pick us after 8pm as I wanted my group to stay for the 7:45pm light display.The music and announcement came on and we all strained our neck and waited for the lights to come on.... The music continued for another 10 mins, but nothing else happened. The whole thing ended as abruptly as it started. I told my group who were wondering what we have missed, that something was not right. I called the customer service office which was said to be opened till 9 pm but no one answered my call. I wanted to know what is happening, but I got no answer. We waited hoping there would be some form of apology of announcement, but none came. As the bus was waiting, we left disappointed. I especially felt let down as I was the organizer to the trip and was telling my group about the light display, but that never happened.I wrote in to express my disappointment and I got a reply saying there was some technical problem and also the PA system was down. What about the call I couldn't through? Why no officials came to tell the waiting crowd? I told them luckily we were locals that could afford the time to make another trip although we might not. Imagine the tourists who made the trip and do not know what had happened thinking that that was all there is to the much advertised Light Display."
"We had some time to kill and decided to stop by the two domes we kept seeing as we traversed the island. What's great about it is that it is a very well designed and maintained attraction. All man made and impressive when one thinks about the logistics to bring in the plants from all over the world. The domes are air-conditioned and that on its own is also quite an amazing feat of engineering. Having said that, I think I was impressed for all of 15 seconds as I entered the first dome and then I was quickly looking for a way to walk though it all fast.If you are into plants and gardening, you'll love it. My mum did because she has green fingers. For the rest of us, it got boring pretty quickly. It could be a very educational experience if you take your time and choose to make it so. If you're considering taking your family there you might want to think about what everyone might make of it. It isn't something all would appreciate. Sorry I don't share the enthusiasm of other reviewers.Not a place I'd visit more than once if I can help it."
Good scenery in the morning especially with the sunny weather in Singapore. Lots and lots of greenery! Night time also alright - very beautiful lights twinkling in the dark. Nicely crafted chairs e.g. crocodile chairs and many well-designed items around for lots of photography.
Interesting concept and structures but too extensive an area for the few key attractions. Couldn't help feeling a bit of a waste of space. SuperTrees looked better when lit at night. Ticket prices to attractions are a little expensive.
This is a fantastic attraction but why should overseas visitors pay more than twice local entry fee. Blatant racial/national discrimination.
Not that spectacularbut it does serve very fantastic views of marina bay sands from inside. visit cloud dome as well
"Rather too much concrete for my liking. Also, the admission fees for overseas visitors are hugely more expensive than those paid by locals. This is not good and must change immediately."
"I was very intrigued by the view from the top of Marina Bay, but there's really not much there. Don't get me wrong, it's nice, but I thought the perspective from the bow of the Marina Bay was much better."
"We live in Singapore and went to see what all the commotion was about.If you ignore the irony of the concept itself, the Gardens is actually a 'modern marvel', as History channel would say.The domes are the real draw; I was quite awed at the landscaping of the Cloud Dome.If you are easily thrilled by heights, you can walk on the skybridge for a free.Whatever it is, this is truly a tourist 'trap' especially if you come from a place with real actual gardens."
Be warned if you visit Gardens by the Bay in the evening. The attraction itself is fantastic but... We wanted to catch a taxi back to our hotel after enjoying our visit to the gardens. We stood in line for almost half an hour without making any progress before deciding to walk back. Every taxi was ON CALL which means they can charge extra. Taxis were pulling up ON CALL and people were climbing in without any names or references appearing to be exchanged. We made use of the helpful (?) notice nearby and kept calling the various companies to book a taxi. All were engaged. I don't know what the solution is. How would we know which taxi was for us even if we had managed to book one? The locals we spoke to in the queue weren't happy with the situation either. The Gardens by the Bay are lovely and worth visiting but my husband's birthday treat wasn't the enjoyable experience I had hoped it would be thanks to the shambles with the taxis and our long walk back. Perhaps someone in the know could make it very clear how to avoid these problems so that tourists are forewarned in future.
"I would give higher rate for this place if I didn't pay to visit both domes.I struggled a bit whether to visit the domes in my planning stage but was encouraged by quite a few friends who have been there before quoting this is must-see places. So I paid sg$23 for both domes( it's discounted tickets through local travel agent, official price is $28 but $20 for SG permanent residents).To be frank, though the dome is designed very user-friend but really not much to see inside, I didn't see much flower blossom in flower dome, nor rare species of flowers. Forrest dome is designed well and get u a bit surprise also shared lots of environmental knowledge. The man-made waterfall is a bit rare indoor. So if u have to visit one dome, I would suggest Forrest dome.Garden itself is not large but well designed and maintained. Very easier for all ppl walk. OCBC skywalk looks cool but when I was there, it was closed due to drizzle.Transportation is very convenient, just took Circle line and drop at bay front station for around 5min lovely walk with oversight of MBS and the garden before u arrive. Also it's easy and close walk to MBS (2min) and esplanade.You got great location in the garden to take shot for MBS and SG flyer. And it's free if no domes or skywalk."
"Unfortunately the waterfall attraction was closed due to maintenance and we picked the worse time of the day to go. We decided to go just before lunch and it was a scorcher!.Couldn't handle the heat and unfortunately had to cut our trip short and head back to the pool at our hotel.Definitely well worth a visit but i'd suggest you'd go later in the afternoon, plus you'll take some amazing & beautiful photos at night."
Had many plants but the flowering plants were rather common. Was expecting to see more flowers which cannot be seen locally.
Beware of the utility vehicles buzzing around the park on the pedestrian footpaths. My son almost got ran over and the people in the vehicle yelled at us to look out and get out of the way. You would think that any vehicles driving on a footpath would yield to pedestrians - not here. Watch your kids. This is a bad case of road rage at a family park.
It is only new and I had heard a lot about it but was a bit disappointed when I visited. For the entry price I thought it could have been better.
"There are a lot of types for a garden, like Indian garden- Chinese garden, etc. I am not a fan of gardens and plants anyway, I want to go here because I want to change the way I think about them. Unfortunately, nothing happened :(But if you like gardens, I bet you'll love this place.Enter the Domes to get the best experience of this place."
"There is nothing like this in the world. Whether you like it or not is a matter of personal taste. My most frequent thought was 'How much did all this cost?' and 'Why?' rather than 'How beautiful this is'.I was however rather overcome (almost literally) by the route we took to get there. On our map there seemed to be a way from the Sands Hotel shopping complex across the motorway, and indeed there is. You start from about 4 floors up. There is a sign to the Gardens pointing up a long escalator. You arrive at a landing faced by another very long escalator over about an 30 meter drop. Nothing on either side but space. Now I'm not the greatest lover of heights so I looked for a way down again. There isn't one. No down escalator and no lift. You have to go up this very scary one. With my wife's help I made it.You end up on a very windy roof (the wind had blown the sign posts over) but at least there was a lift. Having been through so much we decided to press on and crossed the motorway bridge. On the far side there are some long escalators back down again. However after my wife did a reconnaissance we found a lift to ground level. Phew! Now the gardens have a number of extremely vertiginous walkways so perhaps this is their way of sorting the visitors out!Having got to this point I was determined to find a different way back and the answer is the MRT. The entrance to the new MRT 'Bayfront' station (CE1) is at the park ground level.So if you wish to go there on a less scary route take the train.Hope this help somebody."
"We went there as a family on a recommendation - not quite sure what we expected, but certainly more flowers and colors. Its well made, interesting enough, but didnt quite catch my imagination .."
"It isnt that its a bad attraction. Its just overated! We wanted to visit the two domes - flower dome and cloud forest. The flower dome is decidedly average and the cloud forest....well the landscapers need to finish the job by covering up the concrete and the centre piece of the dome with plants so you dont see the people waiting for the elevators. The waterfall is average.Is it worth $40 ($48 if you dont live in Spore) for 2 people, no not really."
"It was an above average attraction. It is basically just a very well organized garden. The location is great of course, just opposite the Bay Sands Hotel. If you are not too much into botany as a professional or amateur, you'll find the place a drag.. but its free! Some of the detailing on the plant zones are interesting. The cubes (paid entry) is strictly your choice. I guess most people pay to enter simply because they figure they've come all the way, so what the heck! We visited the Cloud/Rain cube and it was interesting, but not outstanding. Ah yes, you get a 10% discount if you have your Singapore Airline boarding card counterfoil"
"Was ok and somewhat interesting, but not ""top flight"" attraaction for out of towners. Easy to get to, driving or by taxi."
"I went here with my family recently to take a walk. Found the free garden to be nice, but pales in comparison to Botanic Gardens which I feel is more beautiful. It was very hot and the restaurants were far from the ticket counter. The garden dome is pretty, but I wanted more flowers from around the world like Sakura blossoms."
This is great green area right in the heart of the city. If you love Plants a most see and the Towering Tree structures look futuristic from a distance and up close. Lots of walking to the park and around the Park . The two big glass domed conservatories are a must see . Bring your cameras.
"The lights at night are pretty, they are synchronized to music and I find the concrete tree area much better at night, the catwalk is much cooler then too. A bit sad as the whole place used to be a jungle but here I was enjoying a concrete version of it in the city. The indoor rain forest, well, I could say the same. it is nice to visit and good for photos with the Marina bay sands in the background so long as you do not think too deeply about the reality."
"As these gardens have just been opened they are very young. Even so they are still worth visiting. Take a hat, good shoes and water. Until there is more foliage cover you are quite exposed to the sun. Wil be great in 2-3 years."
"Halfway round the Cloud Forest, I was struck by the realisation that I was inside not a biodome, but a metaphor for Singapore itself. The interior of the Gardens By The Bay are a sterile, carefully managed environment which allows for no mess, no fuss, no dirt, no animals, just plants, carefully arranged and illuminated. The overall effect isn't so much to be awed by nature, as to feel like you're lost in a shopping mall that specialises in plants and is strangely devoid of cash registers.On the positive side, it's much cooler than outside, but really, air conditioning shouldn't be a reason for visiting somewhere. There's lots of plants, but there's a real paucity of informational signs (apart from the possibly ironic ""Secret Garden This Way"") so unless you're an assiduous botanist, you won't know what you're looking at. (Or you should have paid another $4 for the audio tour.) There's just a real lack of character.There's also a lot of slippery surfaces, because of the high humidity (provided by misters and the enormous waterfall) which mean somebody is bound to slip and hurt themselves sooner or later. Be careful how you tread.Outside is a bit better. There was an enormous queue for the sky walk when we arrived (7pm on a Sunday evening) but the outer gardens are quite pleasant to walk through at ground level - you don't really need to elevate yourself that much. Although you can go up one of the 'supertrees' and have dinner, looking down on hoi polloi beneath you, it again seems quite unnecessary; gardens should be about encountering nature, not looking down on it.The gift shop is (unintentionally?) hilarious, shelf upon shelf of tasteless knick-knacks and geegaws made out of gold, nothing whatsoever to do with gardens (unless an enormous gold carp on a piece of wood is some horticultural reference I didn't get); I assume it's there to cater to somebody who got lost in the Marina Bay Shoppes and staggered down to the Gardens, then panicked because they weren't in a soulless mercantile environment.So, in short, go to the gardens and walk around, but skip paying the entrance money (and queuing for a long time) for the domes - they're better viewed from outside than in."
"Given the amount of money spent on developing Gardens by the Bay I expected a little more. The conservatoriums are very nice, but more could have been done. The ticket line is too long. Given the heat and the fact this is in Singapore where everything works, the queue should take much less than the 25 minutes it took me. In a few years when the super trees grow more plants they will no doubt be stunning. Make sure yiu go after 430 PM to avoid the heat"
"Nothing very special there. Conservatories & garden is not very extrodinary for the price you pay!!Sky walk is ok, you get good view.even light show is just so-so."
"Living in Singapore for a few months now, I had the opportunity to stroll through the gardens to meet the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Very well manicured, it seems the gardens are almost more about the architecture than the plants themselves. I enjoyed the culture-themed areas (Indian Gardens, Chinese Gardens, etc.) for what they were - bland and informational.However, I was pretty disappointed. It seems the hype these gardens conjured lies in the two domes - which require payment before entry.Go to the Botanic Gardens - the entire thing is free (save for the tiny Orchid garden, which in itself is a paltry $5) and its more about the plants and less about the constructed surfaces they grow upon."
"If you are not looking for an authentic nature experience but rather something safe and clean close to the city center, this is the place for you. A fairly nice walk."
"The gardens are well done and well maintained and free. However, if you want to get onto the sky bridge, you have to pay some 8SGD. Go in the evening, since it gets very hot during the day and there is no shade cover, so can get very tiring."
"This is clearly a new destination with young plants. We tried to get the tour, but after walking to the other side of the park to catch the second to last tour of the day, we were told it was sold out as was the last tour of the day. Disappointing."
"This is the latest attraction in Singapore and one of the places to go if you love all things flora. I only had time to check out the Chinese, Indian and Malay outdoor gardens and the 2 conservatories.The outdoor gardens are beautifully landscaped. What I find rather lacking is the number of plants in each garden and also insufficient signs (of plant name, location, and descriptions). The same thing with the 2 conservatories - lovely place especially the Rainforest. Yet again, the lack of signs.Facilities are adequate. Number of choices of eateries too. Bring hats and umbrellas and plenty of hydration if you are taking public transports there. The trees' canopies have yet to reach the size for adequate sun screening :)I look forward to visit GBTB again when the phase 2 is completed."
"I did a lot of research on the internet on this Garden by The Bay.It seemed very interested with all the promotion, attractions, etc.I came there in the evening with my children.Tell them a lot that we would enjoy and see many exciting and interesting things.It was Tuesday evening. The site seemed very deserted, very few people there.I tried to find out what makes it so famous.We walked around, tried to find any interesting things that some people talking about.Alas, since the lack of information ,directions and signage, there was really almost nothing to do and see.It was just an ordinary giant garden with some of giant iron tree and closed.Still not believing that I just found something after walking quite far, I was wondering around again.Really, there was hardly nothing to enjoy and see. Walking so long made us all sweating for nothing.Just a little tip, beware of what you are expecting for, you might not find it."
"Though variety of flowers is not great, you can feel that the hosts are very considerate. They provide ample FREE rest rooms that are clean (basic need for any human), unlike some countries where rest rooms at attractions are rare; those at public places like transit / train stations are not free & can cost up to USD$2/entry; free water cooler; plenty of places to sit & rest. The directional signs need to be improved though. Admission fee is reasonable considering that it is so well kept - clean, cool & very neat !!"
"Being Singapore, heat and humidity is a concern, especially if you will be in direct sunlight.The Supertrees are indeed eye catching, they provide a fresh perspective of the Singapore landscape, a huge contrast to the Singapore Flyer in the background and also the MBS Tri-towers.Gardens have four Singapore ethnics gardens, a feel of how each ethnics group gardens will be.We will recommend people to come by sunset or at night to see the lights lit the trees and surrounding architectures.It wasn't too bad a place to spent a few hours, just too bad that it has not complete building the whole park."
"Very impressive to look at, but we didn't make it all the way there after a very hot walk from the MRT. You can still get a great view on the way back through the hotel on the elevated walkway."
"Some things are worth the money, and some things aren't. $S60 for entry into the flower dome and cloud forest is steep and hardly worth it, unless you are particularly into flora. The bridge linking the supertrees at $5 is a steal and offers a fantastic view of the Marina Bay Sands."
"Good value but a long walk (in the heat) from the MRT (underground). Inside the dome was lovely and cool.We visited the Flower Dome which had not been open very long and to be honest it showed, Some of the plants were not at all established and I think some were dying (they should have been removed). The labelling of the plants was variable. Some of the displays were almost at eye level so difficult to view.We then visited the Cloud Dome and to be honest I could not work out what it was all about. It seemed to be an impressive inside tall waterfall surrounded by plants. As the plants were high in the air it was not clear that they were and they clearly needed more time to get established. The other main part of the dome was a display was about global warming that I am not sure fitted in with a large air-conditioned building,"
"I guess we were expecting more, but we found this a bit disappointing. Tickets for the enclosures (cloud forest and flower dome) were pricey and probably not worth it. Plus, a lot of the plants haven't really grown out yet. I wouldn't rush to visit..."
if you want to keep cool- visit this air conditioned wonderland! the artificial or man made gardens are ok. nice to get away from the heat and shopping. relaxing time and grat for people of all ages.
Went to garden by the bay....good place to visit....Cloud forest was a good experience also flower gardens were good too....but lots of walking takes a toll on the body...next time i would like to visit @ night time..
"massive eco project full of info about the planet etc.if youve been to the eden project dont waste your money, as it is expensive to enter and thats just the start of it! we could have spent all day there but we had enough after one hour. not recomended."
"I enjoyed the glass-houses and thought it has a very good selection of exotic plants. What will happen when some of the tress grow tall and hit the glass roofs : }?The open areas (free) however are too built up. The pathways are wide but all tiled up. There are enclosures for tress, which also act as seatings for tourists, and these are also concrete. I much prefer to the Botanic Gardens, where there are paths and fields and streams - more natural and gives less of an urban feel.Also a little expensive."
"Singapore is basicallya hot place. I happened to be there on a hot day, or I should say extremely hot day, The place rarely have shelters, you will need to bring brolly/hats and water if you do not want to fall sick after this trip.There is a cafe (Cant remember the name) near the 2 chargeable dome, which is the only place that you can choose to rest if you don't mind paying for a drink. other than that, stay looking for shelters.Maybe the weather is too hot, the plants seems to be drying up."
"This is an interesting use of land, basically a big garden with several manmade ""trees"" as the highlight. We were underwhelmed by the light show as they could've made it more upbeat, but if you're checking out the Marina Bay Sands, you might as well drop by the Gardens. Just do so at night, or get baked!"
"I think the Gardens by the bay will be a lot better once all the plants are mature enough. However, it was a nice relaxing evening stroll after a busy day in the city"
"The garden opened a few months ago. To my opinion, it shows as many plants look still young and the flower / plant beds are not lushed yet - some looking even like nursery stock.A lot of asphalt, concrete, man-made buildings do not allow me to feel completely like in a real garden.The hothouses are really impressive buildings; I really like when the sails are opening to cover the glass when the sun glares. However their entrance fee (20 dollars per adult if local resident, 28 for visitors) is really too expensive and not completely worth it.The exhibits regarding climate change are childish, unclear, full of false truths and to my opinion counter-productive to a good education in environment care (to which I am in favour of in general).I would recommand a quick tour to look at the city center from the garden but to reserve the paying visit to the Orchid Garden and to allow for longer time in the Botanic Gardens than here, if you're really keen on plants and gardens that look a little like nature."
"The gardens are huge but seem to be repetitive, one area looks pretty much like another and no food court is available ehich is not great if your on a budget and want to eat there"
"I went here to have a look at the new establishment thinking it would be something very different and interesting. When arriving it looked interesting, I got my map of the gardens and started to walk around. The gardens where informative however not overally different from any others that I have been to.The charge to get into the domes was outrageous (Aug 2012 was S$28) - there was no way I was paying to see plants.I assume this would be much more enjoyed by green thumbs, however it was dissapointing for me as an average person with average interest in see gardens whilst traveling."
"I visited Gardens by the Bay the week after it officially opened. I was looking forward to my visit as I had had a preview of the Flower Dome during the World Orchid Conference last December, and had been impressed with what I saw there. However I was somewhat disappointed because my interest is in tropical plants, and the Flower Dome had only Mediterranean plants on display. (I guess all the tropical orchids I had seen in there in December had only been placed there as a special display). The Flower Dome is certainly a respite from Singapore's humidity (it was constructed to replicate a warm, dry Mediterranean climate, and there are some very colorful displays of flowers, but didn't hold my interest for very long.I found the Cloud Forest cooled conservatory more interesting, but it feels much more like ""work in progress"" than the Flower Dome. This conservatory features tropical plants from the highland regions of the tropics. I also found some parts of the Cloud Forest conservatory a bit ""touristy"" but could be educational for visiting parties of school children. I don't believe that crystals have any magic properties, so that part I found a bit tacky.Considering that there is no charge to visit Singapore's magnificent botanic gardens on the north side of the city, I considered the $28 charge to visit the two conservatories a bit steep. And I was annoyed that tourists have to pay more. Having visited gardens in many countries around the world, I believe there should be one standard admission charge because these charges add a lot to the cost of a holiday. A season pass can be offered to local residents who wish to visit often. I can understand why tourist attractions in the poorer developing countries may have charge locals less, but SIngapore is such a wealthy country that a good proportion of the locals would be earning more than those visiting! And tourists over 60 should be aware that the senior citizen rate only applies to locals. Even though there is a senior citizen rate listed for tourists, it is $28 - the same as the standard tourist rate! (Why bother to list it separately?)""Work in progress"" would also be a good way to describe the free gardens outside of the conservatories and the steel ""Supertrees"" (which I assume will eventually have creepers growing right to the top). In a few years time they may be worth visiting in their own right, but at the moment the area outside of the conservatories is not on a par with the main botanic gardens.Facilities are generally good in and around Gardens by the Bay. It's a fairly long walk from the nearest MRT station in the heat, so older people may prefer to take a taxi there. The restrooms are clean and there are several food outlets. The coffee shop next to the souvenir shop has good food but is not cheap. Skip their coffee though and get one when you return to the Marina Bay shops. Their menu shows a nice Italian latte with good crema in a china cup, but what you get is a flat white coffee in a paper cup. When I was there one customers was loudly complaining that the photo on the menu was misleading and demanding that they serve her coffee in a china cup. The manager was telling her they couldn't do that because they didn't have any china cups!I've given Gardens by the Bay an 'Average' rating because it is really not yet at the stage where I would rate it as 'Very Good'. Average is not really the right description for this multi-million dollar development - probably better to call it ""Getting there slowly and may be worthy of a Very Good rating in a few years"". However, if you are interested in plants/gardens and you are not likely to return to Singapore for a few years, then I would still recommend a visit whilst you can despite its current shortcomings."
"been there only for a while, we re way too late. its already dark when we re in the garden. only watch the light show, the show is just average, nothin special so we leave early, not waiting until the show finished. i believe the indoor garden we amazing, will come back later somewhere next year."
"Garden by the bay - more like a big PARK area where u can go for a stroll in evening with the view of MBS( marina bay sands casino). The sky bridge is only a short distance walk that cost S$5 per pax , which I think is not worth. The two DOMES may be a good visit for those who love trees and plants, for the only interesting part is the HUGE man made waterfall within a greenhouse. And the top height have a MINI suspension bridge. Tourists entrance fee cost abt S$30 per pax. Any parts of Malaysia forest or Cameron highland, can really get to feel n touch of the nature for FREE, unless you only can spend a day or two in Singapore, properly this is a place to come after a fun air condition RIDE In flyer or for those who do not like to shop and gambles in MBS , may walk over to have some food in a park area. FANS of Singapore and Malaysia food lovers should try out the SUPERTREE foodcourt like the rendang chicken rice , Singapore laksa , char kway teow(fried noodles with cookles and seafood)."
"Yes, it is good but there was still a lot of building work going on when I went. Lots of trees and plants from all over the world. A nice place to walk round and relax. The plants need a year or so to get established before it reaches its true potential but worth a visit."
There is no doubt that Singapore will have another great tourist spot with Gardens by the Bay. The complex is huge with great gardens and structures. Unfortunately it is still partly under construction and when we went there one of the conservatories was also close for maintenance.We will probably check it again after a year when it has been completed 100% to see some locations that were not ready yer.
"Being the latest tourist attraction in Singapore, this garden is definitely a place tourist should not miss. You can walk around the garden for free or pay a small entrance fee to the Conservatory or Skyway. The lighted giant trees were simply beautiful with the nice backdrop of the marina sands. In addition, the free music and lights show at 7:45pm, daily were simply splendid and worth our visit!"
"Visited this new attraction. For a Botanical Garden it is a bit sterile and contrived, but given time could become rather lush and perhaps even garden like. As is the case with most attractions in Singapore it is very clean and structured.It really does have a Jurassic Park feeling without the animals...Of the two conservatories, the Cloud is the best, although there is a nice bar called Pollen in the Flower Dome.It is a nice place to visit on a hot day since it is air conditioned... which is nice but strange for a botanical garden.."
"Got my first glimpse of this attraction when departing the airport for my hotel. It's definitely eye-catching and intriguing, those tall Supertree towers and the puffy giant glass domes. Nothing else like those trees in the Singapore skyline, nor any other skyline. I visited just as the sun was setting so that I could see the Bay South gardens all aglow when night fell, as other reviewers have described. Aside from the supertrees and a couple of nice photo spots, there's not that much to set this garden apart from others. Lots of well landscaped greenery, but most nice parks have that. There also wasn't as much lighting as I thought there would be... perhaps some of the features were being renovated? In fact, once it grew dark, you couldn't see any of the garden except for the tall supertrees. The Garden Rhapsody light show happens at 7:45 and 8:45pm; basically, the trees take turns twinkling and blinking various shades set to music and narration. If you happened to have paid $5 to be up on the Skywalk at that time, hang out there and catch the show from above. Also a great place to see the Singapore skyline. The Cloud Forest dome was closed during this visit so I can't comment on it. The ticket seller also told us that the Flower Dome would be too dark to enjoy the flowers inside, so unfortunately, I can't comment on that either."
"These Supertrees take most of the limelight when they advertised the Singapore's Garden by the bay. But actually, its not that ""super"" at all. They played symphony on certain hours, but im not impressed coz the supertree's lights doesn't ""dance"" with the music. oh well, but at least the 2 domes make our visit worthwhile. My favorite is The Cloud Forest... the falls and the orchids makes my day... the FLower Dome is so so... with the entrance of $12 each or $20 for 2 domes and $5 for the Skywalk.... i can say its expensive. Singapore's Botanic Garden will still be my favorite."
"This attraction had just opened and maybe there were some adjustments to be made. There is a walkway high up between the "":trees"" which you must buy tickets for before 7.30 pm- which was only just after dark and we missed it. the lights get turned off at about 9pm so overall, get there on dusk to get the full effect. The illuminated ""trees' are not as spectacular as I'd hoped and the show ending so early was a disappointment."
"You pay for either entry to one or two domes - in my view the flower garden was not that interesting... The garden in the sky was quite fascinating and worth the moneyThe outside garden is free, but still not grown in...I would recommend to go to the botanic garden or for a stroll at fort Canning which is a much more original setting"
"The place is great no question about it, the problem is we came in at the peak of the sun and boy it was so hot that it took away the beauty of the place.We said that will go back during dusk but alas just did not have the time to visit but we said that will come back on our next trip to Singapore."
"Probably, I have too much expectations on this so called mega projects...... Whatever it is, the super trees are looking good in pictures....The music and light show is kind of disappointing.... Lack of ""umph""."
"I went to this newly opened garden on a Sunday and found it swamped, especially to purchase tickets. I gave up and left to return on a weekday. Again, on a Tuesday, just to buy the tickets to enter the domes you have to wait in line 30 minutes. Ridiculous! They need to have more counters open (only 2 on the day I went) or get modern and open self-service kiosks that would make the whole experience less frustrating. It's a real pity that this system is in place because the grounds and domes are quite enjoyable! Also, be aware you cannot buy tickets for the trees or the electric cart tours at this gate, rather ""over there"".Recommend for children, obviously, but inside the two domes it's cool and not too noisy, and I think the elderly visitors really enjoyed that. A great experience once I stopped raging about the admission."
"The place is still work in progress. The outer garden is free but you would not enjoy walking in the open air under the hot sun with all the ongoing construction going on at the surrounding area.So in order to fully appreciate the place gotta pay $ 28 to enter the aircondition conservatories - Flower Dome and Cloud Forest. By the way, the tickets are for multipler entries.Ticketing - Inefficient and hopelessly unorganized. Poor crowd management with only 2 counters open for day ticket. Some people eventually gave up after waiting for too long. When we were there, we noticed strangely that all caucasian were approached by a caucasian staff in uniform to skip the Q to purchase their ticket in a special room. When some Asian tourist asked him , he said for those who pay cash no need to Q . I was just wondering why he assume only the caucasion is paying cash and the rest of us was not offered the same privilege.For foreigner, there is no discount for senior citizen and no separate ticket available for the 2 conservatories ...Flower Dome - Plant lover would love this place which feature plants, trees and flowers from all over the world. Some of the tree were probably uprooted from its country of origin and replanted ...without any leaves or branches. I hope the trees will survive.The Cloud Forest - man made waterfall and plant (mainly fern) stuck on the wall. Not very realistic. Don't expect to see much orchid or pitcher plant as advertised. The Crystal mountain was a joke !The sky walk - $5 per adult. If you are afraid of height, skip this. Nice to go after dark to see the background comprises of Marina Sands Bay and Flyer. Don't go during peak hour as the staff will usher you and rush you through the walk to allow the second batch of people to come up.Food - strongly advise to bring your own food. The eateries were obviously not prepared to handle crowd. We ordered 2 Nasi Lemak with tea which we thought would be fast but it took forever to arrive. They were quick to take our order, slow to serve and even slower to give us our bill. The taste was average but cost us $ 30Transport - We hang around till 9pm so we decided to take a cab . There was a long Q at the taxi stand and believe it or not not even one single cab present ! Eventually everyone were forced to call a cab. It was just unbelievable not to have any cab around at the latest attraction in town.This place is worth a visit as it is unique but unlikely to go again due to the long Q, average and pricey food and separate admission charges."
"Undoubtedly the Cinderella of Singapore Tourist Attractions. Few Singaporeans think much of the Gardens except its free admission, humongous grounds and a place to hideaway from corporate noise.Yet this is, to me, the real Jewel of Singapore. Aesthestically the crown jewel of Singapore's Garden City heritage. Ecologically, it encompasses the best of ornamental botany with the latest in sustainable environmental breakthroughs. (Look underneath the Super Trees)A walk through the Gardens quietens the weary soul and revitalizes your spirit. This is one attraction you don't want to go in a group and certainly not in a coach.Go with someone dear to you. Allow for a whole evening if you can. Take in paranoia of Singapore City as well as the balmy air of the sea.Must visit the two domes. The few dollars for admission is worth it. And yes the nightly musical light shows are astounding."
"Singapore is full of tourist attractions and activities, one can spend over 10 days in Singapore and still miss out on a few good things.""Gardens by the Bay"" is no doubt a beautiful place and one can enjoy the scenic beauty of the same. But the main question arises is it really worth your time and money.This is kind of a picnic place and if you just want to complete a checklist then you can try this place else avoid it. In my opinion this place can be avoided and you will not miss something major in Singapore."
Has done well in terms of crowd control at the attraction. Staff are polite and friendly. venue is cozy and clean but rather disappointed by the condition of sakura. most of the flowers have withered.
"Definitely not worth the money. Plants are pretty but not enough of them and no names of the plant species. Indoor facility is too cold. For a much better experience I'd go back to the Botanic Garden instead. Beautiful garden, lots of native species and it's free"
"What a weird place. Daffs next to dahlia, just does not make any sense at all. Compared to the eden project in the uk this is I'll conceived."
This place is extremely overrated! The cloud forest was nice. The flower dome was disappointing. The tickets are expensive and since it was raining and we were crunched for time we decided to get the buggy from the ticket area to the entrance - separate charge for that. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Just roam around the free gardens outside and leave the ticketed areas. If you really want to just do the cloud forest and skip the flower dome completely.
"For the price of admission to the various attractions within the park, I don't think it was worth. Everything was a bit underwhelming. Maybe just a walk in the park would be a better choice. You can walk around the bay which is pleasant."
"The garden itself is quite fine, although by far inferior to the Botanic Garden of Singapore. It is also much more crowded, because all tourists go there if they have 1 or 2 days in Singapore, and there are many ligth bulbs. The flower dome was AWFUL. Too many people, Christmas plastic trees with plastic decorations. I say it again: Go the the Botanic Garden instead!"
Too many people inside the flower dome. And in every step of the way you'll feel sorry for obstructing others from taking selfie/photos.
"Payed 28$ for Cloud and flowers dome + 8 for the tree top walk, to pay in another thicket place. Tree top is 200m at 20m hight. You get a great view of sand bay hotel, that's all. Flower dome is useless and cloud not much more. On one hour you can have finished. If it's raining , since it's covered, could be an option."
"First of all, we loved the waterfall, exhibition and documentation in the cloud forest. The trees and lightshow at night are also stunning. BUT:They show you a documentary about climate change in the Cloud Forest, which makes you think about your own contribution to save the planet (great!) and at the same time you find a Mc Donald's (?!) in the middle of the park, a gift shop full of stuff wrapped in plastic with loads of unnecessary souvenirs and the Flower Dome is filled with christmas decorations out of plastic (artificial snow in between the flowers). It's ironic, sad, stupid and so much else... Who worked on this concept? In the end it's only about profit, entertainment and fullfilling the visitors needs to shop and make pictures. Would be so great, if they'd have taken their own concept serious and would support local businesses f.e. - keep their carbon footprint in mind. See for yourself. I am sure that this project had a big budget, so they should have been able to do better or should at least try to make it better in the future. Nice try, but try harder. I hope there will be some changes."
Not really a well developed gardens. Sparse. Have to pay to go into specific areas. Bit of a gimic. If you want to see gardens go to the botanic gardens instead otherwise save this for night light views.
"its nice. great setup. beautifully done. but once is enough. lots of attractions/facilities were closed. cloud forest closed, kids water play park closed. abit of a hassle to get around. shuttle train only works to and fro the main attraction. its kinda pricey too. so just go once to experience it for yourself. or just google photos and save your energy and money for something more useful or practical like a nice dinner."
"Really wasn't a fan, found it very over crowded. A stupid process for the sky walk I had purchased tix at 5.50 I asked ref girl if I Ching get an allocated time she said no you don't need a time can go whenever, I said we wanted to go at 7.30 she said yes fine just come when ready, so we line up yo be told no you need to get an allocated time which was now only available after 8pm..... with 2 kids in tow we couldn't hang around in the large crowds so asked for a refund which took another 40mins! The show was quiet underwhelming"
"We didn't spend much time in the outdoor portions, so perhaps that might be better. But the two pay-for-access gardens (flowers and cloud forest) are not worth your time or money. Incredibly crowded with essentially a one-way path through, particularly in the cloud forest. Too many people, and the plants are all rather jumbled with no sense of scientific order allowing for a true learning experience. Suggest (weather permitting) you head to the free Bontanical Gardens..."
Garden by the way has some of the best plants covered across and give an experience of sky walk... people who loves to see different plans would like this and definitely not every one will like l. Has the water fall which is an attraction and you can click pictures. I personally did not like this as had to wait for almost 1 hours to get the lift to claim up.... neither me nor my kids find this place to be.
"We came to see the Garden Rhapsody sound & light show. We'd looked forward to it for some time, arrived in Singapore & made a special trip to the Gardens to see the evening show. Unfortunately we arrived to find that the area where the Garden Rhapsody is held, had been fenced off, with a Christmas display inside - only accessible if you paid for entry. When the Garden Rhapsody is usually a free event, we were bitterly disappointed. We had no interest in seeing the Christmas display & weren't willing to pay to get inside so that we could see a usually free event."
All the photos online make it look very vibrant and exciting however in reality there's just a lot of green and the entire place is full of people taking selfies making it hardwork to walk around
"I thought the Cloud Dome and Flower Dome were really disappointing. Very underwhelming, fake and lame. The 'mist show' in the cloud dome was very lame. The tree-like structures were nice though, and the music - light show was quite good fun. But I was really expecting so much more, overall. But plenty of people seem to love it, so what do I know!"
It's ok not a bad place only that it is kind of a rip off for tourists in the sense tourists and non residences are forced to purchased both the waterfall and flower garden and cannot purchase just the waterfall. The flower garden wasn't that impressive and both attractions adds up and ended up a little expensive for what it's worth . Hey said only residence can purchase just one attraction ....this started a few mi the ago . Stick it to the tourists :(Funny thing is the airport just opened up a mall at the terminal with a beautiful waterfall better than the one at the garden !
"Lots of low end noisy Asian tourists dumped by the truck load (well... Gardens by the bay is free after all). Crazy heat / humidity (no fans / ventilation). Day time is of low interest, best time to come is for the 7.45PM ""show"". The light is good for pictures. The show is impressive for the first 30s but then the remaining 14 minutes is just same: poorly picked classical music mixed with a light show on the fake trees. If you have kids they will like it. I did not. If you are well-traveled around the world, you will have seen a lot better shows / set-ups elsewhere. It seems targeted to regional tourists who leave their country for the first time. Come for a pic and leave before everyone else rushes out. MAD taxi lines to leave the place so walk to Marina Bay Sands to increase your taxi chances. 8' walk."
"The gardens themselves are very pretty but the light show was nothing special and the Domes so overcrowded and ""Disney-like"" that I would not recommend them for the price.The Botanical Gardens are much better."
The roses were minimal and almost dying on the last third day of the season. This is not a good representation of the flower dome.
We visited Floral Fantastly. Noticed that many or almost half of the flowers were withering..Also visited the Flower Dome. Many of the roses were withering too. Wonder if they take stock & replenish their display. The Californian gardens that require visitors to climb a flight of stairs up just to see a very small section was also not nicely done up.We r a family of young & seniors.
"We visited both the ""Flower Dome"" and ""Cloud Forest"" because everyone told us to do so. Overall it was somewhere between ridiculous and embarrassing. The ""Flower Dome"" is a pseudo French rose garden with complete with plastic puttos and paper machee ruins. The roses are way to densly planted in tropical style. The ""Cloud Forest"" treats the unsuspecting visitor to an elevator ride to the top of a concrete construction, where they can then walk down between ferns, orchids, and LED lighting. In all fairness, some people seemed to love it, but my partner and I much preferred the more natural Botanic Garden. Btw... it was a bit expensive."
This review is based on the night time light show.People and kids gather around each tree and lie down looking up for the kids light show. Made for young children's. Nothing special.
"We had heard so much about Gardens by the Bay and we enjoyed the (free) gardens, but found the two domes (for which you pay admission) to be a huge disappointment. It was way too crowded with families and individuals blocking walking paths while trying to take photos. The domes are open until 9pm, but I would strongly advise against going after dark. It was difficult to see some of the plantings and, again, super crowded. We ended up going in the evening because the day we first tried to go, only one dome was open so we wandered the free parts of Gardens by the Bay. I'm glad we ended up seeing the domes, but would not go back. If you are limited on time or money, I would skip the domes. Enjoy the free surrounding gardens or enjoy the fantastic, much more beautiful Singapore Botanic Gardens. I would definitely go back to the Botanic Gardens multiple times, but not the domes at Gardens by the Bay."
"It was rather small and it was very crowded, even though they limited the number of people going in. However, I went on a Sunday at 1pm, so if you were to go on a weekday morning it might not be that crowded. It would be better if its bigger because you can finish the place in 15 minutes (excluding the 4D experience)."
"Check their web site and you'll see a list of the major attractions that were and are closed in May & June, which is when we were in Singapore, and so looking forward to seeing them. They make a huge deal about having the world's tallest indoor waterfall, but that doesn't do any good when the thing is closed for a couple months. Why close so many at the same time?"
"Disappointing. Representatives working there, untrained in the way they spoke, dressed and body language. Example, 4D auditorium, after asking the audience if any of us had symptoms cited in the introductory video, the rep said along the lines ""In that case, I will allow (or permit) you to enter..."". GBTB, with huge investments in architecture, should spend on taking queues from theme parks in the US. For $24 bucks, I did not think it was value for money."
"It's a great reclamation project and I understand why the residents of some of Asia's biggest concert jungles would find it impressive, but I found the gardens rather depressing. Stiffly organised and littered with high priced attractions it left me cold. The best thing we did here was eat at satay by the bay, interesting, reasonable prices and good seafood."
I hope this place has been designed for locals to see the plants/flowers in cold climatic regions. Indoor AC temperature maintained grown Tulips and other species of plants/flowers. Didn't feel it was worth a visit having traveled from UK and already been to Keukonhof tulip gardens.
"My husband and i were in the flower and the cloud forest. We enjoyed very much the 2 places : architecture, plants, flowers, signage, design...Also the last 2 rooms in the theatre of the could forest: videos about human pollution / destruction/ exploitation.. (sponsored by ST engenering)...That was perfect to end with the kind of message... you can think about Â« what can i do for a better eco world ? Â»But just after the Â« reviews electronic kiosks Â» you arrive in a GIFT SHOP : world of plastic, where you can buy orchidea flower emprisoned in resin...Furthermore, the bar just outside will provide you single plastic box for your hotdog"
"The name says it all , if you are plant lover and than this is it for you. perhaps a place to safe guard nature for future generations but not worth the money."
"Really disappointed to be honest. Ticket pricing is complicated but I recommend you get the ""bus"" return ticket included as well as entry to the flower dome, sky walk and rainforest. Staff were very grumpy and not helpful. It was extremely crowded (dangerously so) so you could not stop to take many photos or see the exhibits. All very rushed as you need to follow the crowds (there seems to be one way to walk around it's like Ikea on a weekend...hellish)Would not return as I say maybe it's incredible when it's quiet but staff told us it never is quiet so don't waste your money. Take photos from outside it's just as impressive"
"Impressed with the vegetation, the design of the whole park but not so on the management. Signboard/ information board is very confusing right from the main entrance- you have no idea where is the direction from one attraction to another. The OCBC tree top walks started with a complete disaster- the staff will pass you a poorly printed card to show you the time to come back for your slot- no indication given after that. Walked to the lift area and no one was ready at that area. Visitors literally walked in to the lift and get up to the top, get down after walked through the bridge. Someone should have stand-by at the entry and exit at least."
Ok so you got to see the Super trees in Gardens by the bay. Everyone visiting Singapore do. Entry to the gardens is free but everything els that you can do here is crazy expensive. Walking the skyway must be the biggest rip-off in Singapore.Instead head over to the Botanic Garden (also free if you avoid the orchid garden) or maybe the Chinese and Japanese garden (also free) and take in the atmosphere here. Ten times better than this tourist trap.
"Very disappointing. Not much to see and confusing about what is available to see. Heard afterwards there is a good laser light show at certain times in the evenings, but did not see this advertised.All the restaurants are very touristy and overpriced for tourists."
"Great architecture A bit Clinically, no real nature. gardens, no animals. Artificial trees instead of Rainforests."
"I had high expectations but the Sakura Matsuri was pretty underwhelming. I was expecting there to be more cherry blossoms but the exhibit turned out to be sparsely populated. It's a comfort that the flower dome and cloud forest conservatories are airconditioned.I took a ride share car going to Gardens but thought I could take the MRT coming back. Big mistake. 15 minute walk under the hot sun with very little shade, appears they provide a shuttle to get to Bayfront MRT though it looked like there was a fee.Probably good to visit once off but if their special exhibits are anything like the Sakura Matsuri then I wouldn't bother coming back."
Nothing spectacular and very crowded. Even the nightly show at the Super Trees Grove are not that entertaining. I left the 2 domes early because of the excessive crowd.
09 JUNE 2019 ï¼25x standard child entrance ticket (students under 12yoå°äº12å²)5x standard adult entrance ticket (students over 12yoè¶è¿12å²)3x standard adult entrance ticket (teachers)1x Singapore Resident entrance ticket (teacher)
Not impressed- to be honest I think the free gardens outside are far superior. Was way to expensive for what it was... the only good thing was that it was much much cooler which was a relief in the heat. If you have limited time- I'd recommend skipping this. Just looked a little messy to me and the main interest was the window washers who were scattered around the building like spider man.
"Perveived as a 'must visit' in Singapore, but I can't see why. The artificial trees are impressive, but don't waste your money on the two domes. They're full of tourists taking video & selfies and generally information poor..."
Dont know why its in the top 10 list everywhere. There's nothing spectacular at this place. Just a bunch of man made trees with artificial lighting glowing on them.Didn't like it.
"We visited the gardens on Christmas evening and it was seriously crowded to the extent that it was impossible to take a photo, or buy a ticket to the two inside attractions ( flowers and butterflies gardens), the queue was so long and so slow. Yet, at night, it's amazing, the lights and how it's reflected on the trees, plants and flowers. It's worth visiting, but during non- rush seasons and hours..."
"There are some really great bits and the grand circle of trees is amazing, but as I've found with a few activities it's somewhat ruined by crowds of rude, ignorant, pushy, queue jumping tourists.Make sure if you're going via MRT go via Bayfront and ignore whatever googlemaps tells you- we ended up at the marina, which may have technically been shorter / quicker but is walking across and along a lot of busy roads.Problem with the MRT is once the light show is over, you have the vast majority of people in there all trying to leave via one relatively small stairway to get back to the MRT and it's just carnage. Then it's still quite a long way to reach the train. Surprising for Singapore to have something that isn't more accessible, but doesn't stop the crowds.Admittedly we went on a Saturday evening so maybe busier than other days.Avoid the McDonald's unless you want to be shoved in every direction and wait an eternity for your food to be made.The two greenhouses are impressive for about 3 minutes each. Then you're just looking at trees and flowers in a big greenhouse, again surrounded by rude pushy people."
All has been written about these gardens. Is there always the way to say there nothing to see ? And however it's my point of view : some artificial trees... a bridge in the air... a lot of marketing ... Prefer the Mac Ritchie trail with the tree top walk which is real !!!
Flower Dome - The flowers do not seem to be well taken care of. Should have more emphasis on flowers rather than TSUM TSUM theme.Cloud Forest - There should be wider walking space for elders whom are slow in walking and sometimes need to sit (seats) and rest in between walks. There should be safety net in case of falls.
Great Architecture. Surprised to see the plants needs a bit more tenderness and refreshing.Worth the price just to walk in for the aircon.
"There has to be a total revamp Programme on both the forest n flower dome , the flowers are really pale in comparison to our Singapore Botanic and the Forest dome has that totally unmaintained condition with mossess and algae all over the walls . Both domes seems so worn out and dead.. there is no feeling of vibrancy the moment u enter the premises. I don't feel wow by the sight :("
"Im sorry but we were dissapointed with the gardens by the bay. The place is beautiful but we felt bored as we roam around its premises, it is too expensive and quite exhausting. The flowers etc. is not that special even the light show is not that amazing. I suggest that you should go to Sentosa Island instead of coming here. Do not waste your money with just a plain big garden."
It was a disappointment . nothing much to do. minimal flowering and no info on display to know about flowers and plants. People on duty also have no info. Training them with info on the plants might do some good. Miracle garden in Dubai is far better and id much more value for money
Disappointed with what the place had to offer for the price paid for the ticket. Long walk in the mid afternoon sun to reach the dome exhausted my bones and mood. What did I gain from the visit was the question I asked myself and sadly the answer was 'absolutely nothing'.
"I recently visited the cloud forest for the third time last saturday but was very disappointed as the waiting times were upwards of 30 minutes and it was a huge waste of time for my family and I to be queueing. The last time i visited the cloud forest, a few months ago, the waiting times were still manageable and i only had to wait for 5-10 minutes at the most. I'm not sure what has changed, maybe it was more crowded than before but i also realised that previously i could have taken the staircase up to the top level and although it was quite a climb, it actually helped to cut down on the queue times. However, when i visited on saturday, i asked the staff but there was no stairs available for visitors to use, and i had to choice but to wait in line if i wanted to have a full experience of the cloud forest. I also had half to mind to just exit and be done with it. After the cloud forest, we went to visit the ocbc skyway however, the queue time was even more absurd, with the staff saying i has to queue up for more than a hour just to go up. If you're in a rush, i recommend going to the botanic gardens instead! There are no waiting times and better yet, it's free!"
"I like the concept and the design, it was amazing but the atmosphere was unbelievable crowded. How can you enjoy a green garden with that many people?"
The walkways at the basement of Flower Dome were extremely crowded. The Forest Cloud dome had a long line of people waiting to take the lift up. I won't want to go again in the near future.
"I went with my family before national day to gardens by the bay. The smell inside the glass house made me run out of it. Even the trees made you feel what you are looking in singapore, the real nature. I'm very much upset with the price they are charging for visit, when we can grow such plants at home."
"The last time we visited, there were a myriad different species of flowers from many different countries, making it a very worthwhile visit due to the wide variety of beautiful flowers. However, this time round, they were mostly local variety of orchids being inserted into set pieces of balconies, interior spaces etc. If there is any wow factor in this, it'll be 'Wow, have I wasted my time.'You have been warned."
"Look, I get that there's not a lot to do in Sinapore so they created these gardens. And it's fine to walk around there. And the 15-minute light show was worth 7 minutes of my time. But we paid 16 Sing to get into the ""Cloud Forest"" which was a complete and utter waste of money. Man-made waterfalls, and lots of plants, both real and fake, and absolutely nothing worth seeing.My advice: Do the free stuff, skip the pay stuff."
"visited the Singapore Garden Festival at Gardens by the bay yesterday. it was a lovely and wonderful display of international flower cum landscape competition. fantastic and organised management of buggy transportation of different stops. overall was a delightful experience.the only Downside was the hillstreet coffee shop which we visited for the first time. ordered nasi lemak, chicken rice set and chendol. food standard was of average. chicken rice was nothing compared to stalls elsewhere in the food court selling the same thing. the chicken prolly was overcooked as the meat was quite tough. condiments e.g. chilli can be improved. as the place is a tourist attraction, may I suggest the hillstreet coffee shop management to look into the food standard..considered the price customer paid for..which is slightly higher than elsewhere.another observation we had..was a staff was shouting at a group of 3 young gals..gesturing to them a certain section was off limits to patron. maybe it will be more appropriate to approach the gals gently..directing them to the appointed table available instead.the above suggestions..i sincerely hope the coffee shop management will seriously look into it."
"We visited during the morning on a Monday only to find out that one of the conservatories was closed for maintenance. Based on the information I received this happens Monday and Tuesday - Monday the Cloud Forest is closed and on Tuesday the Flower Dome is closed. Thus being there on a Monday, open for us to see was the flower dome, I was less than impressed after seeing the National Orchid Garden on the previous day - Yes it was nice to be in cool place but the garden as such was 100% Disney, not at all worth the $14 per person spent.The Supertree grove was kind of cool and futuristic but probably much more exciting to visit in the evening.Unfortunately left the place less than impressed."
"I'm not sure how to rate this but really, it's an exaggeration. Yes the plants were beautiful. Yes the waterfalls is nice. Yes the other parts of this side of Singapore is nice but the hype is an overkill.Maybe because it's not really the garden per se that is enticing people all over to go gaga over this garden. Maybe it's the ingenuity of the Singaporeans it self.The price is just way too much outrageous for such a place."
Enjoyable walk around the gardens and trees. Weather was looking unpredictable so was a quick visit.
Was there with my mum and my grandmother. There were so many people and a staff just pushed my grandmother over until she fell. I confronted her (i think her name starts with an
Not much flowers and mostly are greens ' wonder why it is called a flower dome when greens are more than the flowers. Some flowers were been damaged by visitors that its stalks had snapped and fell on the ground. Had seen a kid plucked a flower and was holding it. Some of the plants' leaves are turning brown and looks dry at the cactus area ' seems like these plants were not been maintained well anymore. Was not a good visit this time compared to the tulips mania and cherry blossom. Pretty sad with the visit to see that most of the plants were not in good shape anymore.
"There are not too much to see in Singapur, so they buid this Gardens to have something to show.... but still not worth making a trip here and pay the high cost of the entrance..."
It was very crowded and tiring..Can much do without seeing itAlso no exit signs providedPoor management
all the flowers were in poor condition temperature was high too over crowded nothing special waste of time and money
"After paying $58 for 2 tickets to the domes we were expecting to be really wow'd.We went to the flower dome first and we were just so disappointed. It was rammed with tourists, selfie sticks and pushy people trying to get that perfect Instagram photo. Despite the many signs saying not to to touch the flowers and plants, so many were broken and dead from people sitting on ledges where they trail and grabbing roses for pictures. I just didn't get the attraction.. the dome is impressive and many of the plants are really beautiful, however the organisation and displays were nothing out of this world. We wandered for 20 mins or so then just had to leave.We had high hopes for cloud forest and were hoping for the trip to be salvaged! Not the case unfortunately. The queue for the dome stretched for what seemed like miles. After about a 20 minute wait we were in, and then told it was a minimum 1 hour wait to go to the top! (I should mention we went at 6pm which is perhaps peak time so that people can can catch the light show, even still, it was really terrible crowd control.) We got in, the 'mountain' is cool to look at I guess, although I couldn't get past it being a man made structure and not really sure what I was supposed to be marvelling at. Again the queuing and noise and selfies just ruined whatever nice experience we could have had.We didn't bother waiting the hour to get to the top, not sure what is up there but if it's just views of the city I'm sure there is better vantage points from elsewhere.All in all, we didn't enjoy the experience and can't really understand the hype. $28 each is WAY too much.The positives were the area is nice and the tree grove area was cool.Unless your a huge plant enthusiast or have a big budget to work off, I would give it a miss."
I went on 12 May and it was a tulips season and plants mostly in bad shape and tulips were all over bloom. Cloud forest waiting time took too long.
"The exterior looks quite impressive, while the variety of plants is commendable. The tulip display at the Flower Dome is pretty nice.But service here is horrible. Some try, but many others seem tired, irritable, and in some cases, quite cold. In open, public areas of a garden (with no exotic plant species around), my toddler was stopped from playing bubbles because 'others may be sensitive to it'. At the cloud forest, another toddler was not allowed to enter because she was drinking milk from a tiny uht packet (staff said if she was drinking from a milk bottle it was ok). If the fear was of littering, it could be better managed with bins - many of the tourists had brought in all sorts of food and drinks in their bags anyway, and often paused to consume them.Another pet peeve as an Asian, and even more so as a Singaporean - some service staff seem to favor Caucasian visitors more, which in this day and age, is ridiculous.Finally, as a safety issue, the pedestrian/jogging track behind the two domes often had speeding escooters and bicycles entering the track when the vehicle lane had the tour buggy/team on it. And seeing how many visitors kinda saw the area as an enclosed space, it was quite understandable that some stray into the vehicle and bicycle lanes, and may not be aware of the escooters and bicycles coming at them at full speed from behind. Some policing or better demarcation should be made.All-in-all, a disappointing visit."
"Made the long-ish trip to Gardens by the Bay at the end of the day, just before the light show was set to begin. It's a bit ridiculous to be honest, just giant metal scaffolds shaped like trees that light up to songs. It's a like a Vegas attraction. The show I saw was called Journey through Asia, and they played four Chinese songs and one Indian song, so I suppose Japan, Thailand, etc., don't exist for the purposes of this absurd attraction. If you are staying in the area, check it out I suppose, but the Botanical gardens are far more interesting. Three stars of five because there really isn't much to do in Singapore in general, and it appears to have been expensive to construct. This would be one star if it was in Tokyo"
"Compared to our first visit a few years ago, this time around we were disappointed especially with the flower dome where it was just teeming with tourists! Too much & too many! You couldnt enjoy the flowers anymore because people just kept pushing. I had high hopes for the Sakura blossoms but was grossly disappointed. Management should think about how to properly manage crowds."
Plenty of walking. Good place to get some fresh air and exercise away from the air conditioning and restuarants.
"The poor rating is mostly related to absolutely atrocious crowd control, bordering on a safety hazard for guests and staff. The Cloud Forest was manageable, however the Flower Dome was so packed, it was unpleasant to say the least. There was no clear route guides to steer guests in the a general direction with resultant pandemonium. Some parts risked a stampede, it was that crowded!To be fair, the exhibits and domes are beautiful, though not much of the flower dome could be enjoyed."
"Was not sure what was interesting so bought tickets via Klook which were entry to the Cloud and Flowers Dome.my advise is to save yr money and skip them as they were not worth the time. It was just exhibits of flowers, plants, the indoor waterfall and that was it. Nothing great at all, was truly disappointed. It was better to just walk around the park for photos at no cost, enjoy the water play and playground if you have kids and eat at the many cafes or Satay by the Bay food court."
"No doubt a great place but in my view ... the Botanics are better. We visited the Flower Dome and the Cloud Dome at $28 per person - the Flower Dome was a great collection of various flowers all in flower-pots, hardly a natural display and very busy: the cloud Dome was more interesting but again quite limited with the mountain clouds more a sprinkler system. Quite interesting but overpriced.Maybe better at night but during the day the botanics are better."
"The day I was there, a corporate family day was taking place, and there were throngs of employees and their kids carrying balloons and wearing the same T-shirts, jamming the walkways and creating long lines to get in and out as they preened for selfies. Couldn't get near the waterfall or walkway. I felt I was the only person who paid to be there that day. The small sign when I came in to pay said, ""Today is Singel Family Day,"" when it should have read, ""Mobs of people inside. Hopelessly oversold!""But, that's just one day. More interestingly, I felt like most of the plants on display here were just kind of familiar basic rainforest plants and flowers - the kind of stuff you see at Home Depot plant department - planted alongside concrete walkways. And then the fake giant sparkly pumpkins for fall. Bordering on tacky and the plants all were the kind that you see at every botanical garden/conservatory if you're in Cincinnati or Chicago or Milwaukee or wherever. You'd do much better going to the Botanic Gardens in Singapore.Buildings are cool in a Disney-esque sort of way. It would be fun to have a few Singapore Slings and run there around one evening if you had the place to yourself."
I could have saved both time and money by not going to the domes which was boring for both the kids and me. The waterfall in cloud dome is far too small to inspire awe. The only saving grace was the super trees and the absolutely awesome light and sound show there at night.
"Nice place to fill in some time, I visited on a cool day. I have heard it is unbearable in the heat. Could improve bathroom facilities and eating options. These were disappointing."
"The architecture is great but the overall impression is of incongruous planting , no real theme, and ironically for all the green hype lots of plastic animals and staligmites. I think the plants looked like a poorly run garden centre, bedding plants shoved in amongst other unlikely neighbours. some of the growth was the ivy I have been trying to remove from my own garden.they need to see the Eden Project in the UK and learn from that."
"I was there on the 13/1/18 and it was my 2nd trip. Unlike the first trip that left me wanting to visit again, it was so disappointing to see withering flowers in Flower Dome. Cloud Forest is as impressive though."
The places that are free are pretty boring to walk through and the other areas such as the domes and sky bridge walk have an individual ticket; which I suppose is just Singapore.
Christmas decorations this year were not fantastic and the cleaner service at the lavatories were horrible.
"We got to GBTB via Bayfront mrt on Christmas Eve. I got tickets online for Christmas wonderland and 2 conservatories. Naturally I would enter via the entrance situated nearest to the mrt but I was denied entry in the basis that my ticket needed to be redeemable only at a booth situated at the flower dome (which was a 15 Min walk) before I was able to enter Christmas wonderland. I had young children and elderly in tow and the walk was impossible, essentially I had no choice but to pay for the shuttle. I asked for some flexibility to enter Christmas wonderland and walk through it to the flower dome as I was already at the Christmas wonderland entrance but was told that's I couldn't because GBTB had no control over it as they partnered with presumably some other operator for Christmas wonderland. I don't understand why there is only one booth for redemption of tickets inconveniently located at flower dome. They should have made it more user friendly - surely it would have made sense to have a booth located near the mrt. It does not matter to the consumer whether the both was run by GBTB or another operator, the organisers should work together to create a seamless experience for visitors. Worse still, it was Christmas Eve and yet the shuttle ended at 9pm. I had to take the long walk back to the mrt which was difficult for young children and elderly. This also does not make sense especially when public transport is encouraged."
"We can't understand why we have to pay to enter the 'Wonderful '. Quite disappointed that it was a normal market with many food stall, that so. It should add stall for Christmas deco, Street performance."
"Many people went to this place on December holiday which created long que to enter both domes and restaurant.We just spent less than 15 minutes on each dome as we were not happy with the crowd.I visited flower dome few month ago to see tulip flower and it was much more interesting than current exhibition , with less visitor also."
"If you like to have a walk in natural forest than you won't like it, like us. The rain forest is nice prepared. But for 28$ per person it's quite expensive for this place"
"As a visitor to Singapore, I did not know that there were 2 separate domes/conservatories, and that they require separate tickets. The website did not make this known, and neither did it say what the ""Christmas Wonderfland"" consisted of. The Chrismas Wonderland turned out to be utter crap, and everything in there required buying further tickets. The Gardens staff themselves were confused by the ticket types and even let us into domes we did not pay for. Very bizarre and confusing experience for everyone!"
"Not as good as my last visit many years ago. Many of the plants in the flower dome looks lifeless. Dehydrated feel. Furthermore ticketing system is too environmental unfriendly. 1 pc of A4 size per visitor, imagine 10 in the group 10 A4 size. Should start to invest in the QR code scanning system. We're talking about nature, yet we start to help in the destroying of nature even before our visit. Wrote to the Management, but received chap and contradicting answer.Anyway my visit is family with older folk. Pls put that in the sort of visit too."
"The program is not old aged aided. There is only one small entrance and it was long queue. My mum was on wheel chair and it is difficult to push her thru. At the end, I forgo to go in to the xmas wonderland. Worst there is only one entrance if you bought the package deal. Trying to go thru the satay by the bay entrance but was stopped as I need to go to the the flower dome first to redeem the wonderland ticket. So inflexible, rigid and not user friendly. Why can't we enter using the online ticket since it was already stated there. Pls consider all these issues and feedback so that your customer will have a more pleasant trip during this festive season. Another point, the wheel chair rental is till 9pm instead of the closing time, why?? why there is no Family with old people selection below?"
"Skip this and spend more time at the botanical gardens. It offered a good view of the casino, but apart from that was a waste of time."
"You have to buy ticket of 28 SGD per person to visit The Cloud Garden and Flower dom. They are to artificial. It is like education place for student come and get to know about the plantation. It is not gaden at all as it can not combined tropical garden with stell structure....I have been in Chinese and Japanese gardens in Singapore. It is much worth to visit, not the Garden by the BayHowever I appreciate the SG Government efforts to make Singapore to be attractive with more and more sightseeng spots but Garden by the Bay is not worth to visitThere is not enough restaurants or eating places to eat and relax. It is like place with full backpackers visitors"
"Gardens by the bay is big and expansive. It tries very hard to be different and be smart.But at the end of the day, it's a manicured garden, with very expensive glasshouses (albeit architecturally very cool).You can't help think that it's overpriced and directed at touristsIt didn't do anything to inspire me"
My mum is very exciting able to take photo with Santa Claus in Flower Dome. Very disappointed is the Flower dome does not maintain the flowers well as come to 17 Dec all the flowers not flash at all. The wonder Land not much evens. There is nothing special or outstanding this year.
The place is too crowded. Somehow it kills your mood to appreciate the flowers and taking good photos.
The Christmas Carnival is a major flop! There is nothing much for adults and I found it kinda boring. The view is great. What you pay for the ticket it's not worth at all.
"Not much to see at Flower Dome for Xmas decoration., after 6pm went at Christmas Wonderland but kids was not enjoyed as it was raining and aside paying the entrance fee. it is another $$$ to spend for all the rides and games. After all, its not worth the money...."
"It is supposed to be a fun fair thing but most of the items end at 1030pm. The staff actually cut the timing 15mins earlier...therefore we missed quite a few excitment. Moreover, Santa Clause at Flower Dome also have timing."
"I was staying in the Marina Sand Bay and also for other people entrance to the gardens during the day time and night is free. They were promoting a Christmas light show around the super tree in what they called it Christmas Village. The entrance is 8 Dollar per person ( kids or adults), you had to pay extra to walk on the sky walk or visit inside the super tree. The light show itself was really a joke! few minutes of Christmas popular songs with the trees lighting on and off in different colors. It does not worth the money at all. Enjoy the garden and avoid entrance to the Christmas village"
Im not one to spend alot of time seeing these sites so I may be a bit cynical when it comes to these tourist attractions..... and i do not mind walking but when its 30 degrees and 80 percent humidity.... the longvealk takes it tollI guess i just dont see the attraction in this one.
Flower dome didn't have anything. Just pumpkins...my guest had come for the first time . We were eager to show this mainly as we know it was really good . We were disappointed.
Visited this attraction on a short Singapore stay.I didn't know what to expect but was slightly disappointed with what we saw.We were in and out within an hour.
This place is completely over hyped and the fact that you have to pay a bomb according to me to enter the main attractions of this garden is not worth it...The Auto Rider car was the only good experiance
I like nature but this place was quite artificial. For the money they charge the experience is mediocre.
Do not take this the worng way. I think Singapore need more green areas. Thus the garden is a step in the right direction. If you see if from afar it is beautiful. Visiting the garden it is not that intersting.
"After reading some of the prior reviews, I was excited to see this attraction during a 24-hour layover in Singapore. At $24.00 (SGD) a ticket, it wasn't the most overpriced activity in Singapore and it seemed like a fun way to enjoy an afternoon in the air-conditioning. However, I would suggest you take that $24.00 and use it to buy a cocktail on top of the Marina Bay Sands and skip the crowds and chaos that are contained in these two glass domes. Inside, there are beautiful specimens of plants ' everything from Orchids to Baobab trees; there are also some beautiful pieces of sculpture placed throughout the two arboretums. However, the sad part is that one cannot actually enjoy any of these things because the crowds of people are nearly unbearable! The endless sea of selfie sticks and myriad of people who all seem to be experiencing their first pumpkin makes for a human traffic jam that won't soon be forgotten. Furthermore, many of the attractions require a queue line that most participants don't seem to understand or care about and no staff members care to enforce.If here for a short time, I would actually IMPLPORE you to skip this venue ' you won't be missing out!"
Was at garden by the bay with kids. Due to my kid curiosity with the plants and he like to feel the plants on display. We hard hard time preventing him from touching it but your staff keep on reminding us to preventing my boy from touching even she know that I am pulling him away from the display. And she keep on following us till we left the display area. I guess garden by the bay will not be our choice to outing for a long time.
Brought 2 foreign friends to visit on 2 separate occasions. Not much difference. My foreign friend said she will only visit Garden By The Bay once as there was nothing much to see. I fully agree!
"Looks well appointed.Spread over a large space.But nothing to write home about.28 sgd to get in.I did not like, would not go. Not recommended...Bhagwan"
The sky trees have been a massive flop as the vines did not survive. The place is very contrived however the two atriums are interesting buildings... although again the waterfall and climate one is looking really tired... lots of mosses and altitude plants did not survive. Best thing about the whole place is Pollen Restaurant in the flower dome - overpriced and poor service like most of Singapore but a good escape from the silliness of this contrived place.
6 floors of spores. Cold to temperate weather. Circular building with lifts and some eateries. Bring your cameras
"Had been looking forward to this but have to say I was terribly disappointed. People everywhere went through both domes no comparison to the botanical gardens in Singapore or even at home in Brisbane. Crowded narrow walkways people taking photos, selfie sticks, prams & noise. Didn't stay long."
"Like in other parts of Singapore, I didn't really feel the soul of these gardens. It's way too structured, overorganised and man-made that it's almost impossible to relax and enjoy.Although, credit goes fro educational side of it."
Your looking at man made island with towers surrounding it. If you are from North America it will not impress you at all.I mean it's not what I was expecting.
"I visited this 'attraction' expecting lush and green and relaxing. My experience was none of these things. This is about gigantic, I mean really humungusly huge plant life, and exhibits which have been put together in a very contrived way. Most of the 'attractions' are enclosed in two massive air conditioned cage-like domes. Outside the domes it is very hot, and involves a lot of walking, and encountering some awful concrete pylons that hold the whole thing together. And after a while, large as it was, being inside a dome I had the feeling of being trapped, and of needing to escape what felt like a rather terrible zoo, but where the exhibits are plants not animals.Tip: if you must go here then go during the week. In the weekends, the cafeterias, the domes, Maccas, the gift shop are flooded with locals."
There is expensive cost of ticket and havent got nothing to bring memorise to home country . But still i recommend for the whom to visit
The idea was novel 10-15 years ago possibly. The place felt extremely artificial and the flora collection is more ordinary
Go earlyTaxi services are bad.You will not get a cab out from there.Food was overpriced and bad.Tickets are pricey.It's basically a very big greenhouse with various plants..Really not worth the time and money there.
"Hopefully ur can improve more of flowers and some decorations inside, special when we go to cloud forest more disappointed, nothing to see and am not sure will visit second time and will inform all friend if got come to garden by the bay do not enter inside, wasted time and money, not same at all. Anyway i got experience."
"Bit disappointed with the experience. Paid to go into the Flower Dome and expected a mass of flowers. Yes there were some, but we expected more.We saw the light show, which was good.it was extremely humid in there, as you have a lot of fauna around and no air.Pick your timing, so you can enjoy it more than we did."
Visited twice. Once in April during tulips theme and another during blue flowers in May. Tulips was good but blue flowers theme is the worst of all! Wilting flowers and flowers from past theme tulips and i can only probably see less than 5% blue flowers theme. Left aft 15mins. Super awful and wasting my time.
Overpriced & plant variety lacking. Better off going to plant nursery near Macritchie reservoir!! It's such a small place and all the plants are grown in a fake place.
"That's an industrial concept of a garden. The trees are actually some iron structures, and there is asphalt everywhere. Never seen a garden without grass and plants... Artificial and fake. Waterfall comes out of a faucet?"
The place was lovely but the maps and signs were useless.Some of the trees had signs that were faded.Lots of construction going around too ! Much to our dissappintment the Flower dome was closed.
"We spend a rainy afternoon here. Very fast we realized that the gardens did not live up to our expectations.We had just seen the right jungle, so we might be hard to impress.The lights are impressive at nights, but better seen from the distance."
"My friends and I came here during the hot season in Singapore. We love the Flower Dome, plenty of varieties of flowers and plants. We went into the Cloud Forest to cool down. The water mist which fell on us was such a relief on our hot skin. Don't forget to see the Supertree Grove - simply amazing with lighting and music. Fantastic!"
"View stunning, no one to greet you and find you a seat on the terrace , service sloppy and very long , food too expensive but I guess you have to pay for the view..."
There is a beautiful cherry blossom display on at the moment. If it wasn't for that then we would have been extremely disappointed. Not worth the visit and it's not centrally located either
It is amazing to have the possibility to visit the vegetal species more representative of the world in a single place!The one question is : how mediterranean and tropical plants can grow with an internse conditioned air as it is present in the garden?Final evaluation: Impressive the architecture of the garden but in Italy I've seen better places...sorry
"If you will see artificial botanics, you will be right here. Otherways, take the MRT to the Botanic Gardens, gthere you might see real nature"
"A piece of man- made nature. Why do they need this in their generous climate and region. Just go to your neighbour country and enjoy the real nature.A lot of Asia tourists, they are enjoying making pictures with the background of a fake waterfall. Is not worth going and not at all the price."
"I had requested for a stroller for my infant in the information counter. I was told no availability, was asked to check in the visitor facilities section. Upon reaching there, the lady kindly obliged to help get a stroller reserved, apparently there was only 3in total, but this required my infant to be brought all the way to the visitor center to verify, and then for me to walk all the way back to information desk AGAIN to pick up. What's worse... The park is open till 9pm, but u expect dropping off stroller by 8.30 else u will retain passport/NRIC. this is absurd, atleast allow visitor to retain till closing time. We ended up seeing nothing that day since skywalk was closed and the light show was at 8.30 and we had to return the stroller by then. Basically i would advise... Have more strollers pls.. And extend time. Other attractions in Singapore are way ahead in terms of this facility.. It's very very useful.. Charge more if u have to, but have more."
Found this place to be too unreal. Much preferred the Botanic Gardens. Though free to enter you had to pay to go into the special domes- expensive and not worth it.
"Some lovely flower displays, but many look like they are in need of Green Fingers. It must be a big job to maintain such a collection, but some displays looked worse for ware! Did not really get the large crowds, nothing here to justify the high entrance fee. A cool place on a hot day, but a COLD one when we were there on a rainy day! Cannot recommend! Unless someone else is paying :)))"
"Last year came here is free, this year to charge a little disappointed, but also eight Singapore dollars, to go when the lights are bad side"
"We planned to take a walk from the subway. However, it is not worth to go. Just like a garden with a lot of decorations.....However, it is ok to take a look in case you plan to go to the Sands etc....."
"If you visit Singapore, this is a must place to see. My personal excitement is however limited. I am in general not so much a friend of too artificially looking places. And this is definitely one. But if you are in Singapore you have to accept that a large portion of the city is tons of sand and ground brought in from other places and thus this huge and, so I have to confess, nicely planned green part of the city is just part of the game."
"Compared to some of the garden I've been to, such as the Keukenhof gardens in Holland, Gardens by the Bay lacked the wow factor. It was interesting to see plants from around the world but we didn't find the experience worth the ticket price. We spent S$200 here and wish we'd spent our time elsewhere."
"Full of fake nature with not well done jobs which keep deteriorating and fixing.I know the concept is not bad but most of constructions are not well done and cheep job.I like the children's play area but they open only a short time and they do not even allow children to climb trees. Apparently, climbing trees in Singapore is not normal children's activities and staff rush and run to stop children.They also would not maintain the facility well so many things are broken. All staffs are only there to keep the rules and not play with children or fixing places as it needs.Still, it is huge area and many places to wonder around which is good by bicycles and Rollerblade.Connections to the each sections are not really easy to understand and easy to get lost even with the help of the map.Domes are huge but I found it is sad to see that they bring natural nature which they cannot well maintain and able to see the damages... such as Huge stalactites specifically. I love nature so I wish they did not cut and damage nature in such way.Although many of Singapore people might like the Electric tree's sounds and light performances but I just could not enjoy it at all. I wished they play more like classical music and soothing way of spend night.Well, if you go once, that would be enough..."
"Visited the gardens by the bay, some ok things to see, however $28 per adult for a walk around some trees and plants is a bit too far!"
"We had high expectation for gardens by the bay, but unfortunately it turned to be disappointment. What it gives compared to entry fee it is clear mismatch."
"Was hoping to visit the OCBC Skyway, which I missed the last time, only to find out that you would need to pay extra for the Christmas Wonderland section in order to access the skyway (and of course you would need to pay the normal cost for the skyway as well). The Christmas Wonderland starts at 3:30 p.m. everyday and it closes off a large part of the garden. Despite being there at 14:50, I was not allowed in and was told to get back at 15:30. The entry fee was not much, only SGD $4 (at the time we visited), but the way they stopped entry far earlier than necessary, it just made me very disappointed."
"Visitors to GBTB this festive season, please take note: Gardens is holding their Christmas Wonderland event now. This means most of the park is actually closed off to public access after 3pm. You won't be able to watch Garden Rhapsody or take the skywalk at night without buying the admission tickets.From their website:""Public has free access to Supertree Grove and Meadow before 3pm. Please note that visitors are required to purchase Christmas Wonderland tickets to access Supertree Grove and Meadow from 3.30pm to 11pm from 2 Dec 2016 to 1 Jan 2017.""The tickets are sneakily priced to increase as it gets closer to Christmas. Currently they are going at $8...that's $8 to enter an area that was previously FREE. When we visited, a number of people were caught unawares. Tickets are also not sold at the door, so you HAVE to buy them online. Even though it says to print, you can just flash the QR code on your mobile.What's going on at Christmas Wonderland? They have a carnival with games stalls (starts at $4 for a fishing game) and some kiddy rides ($6 per ride), an ice skating rink ($18 per pax), snow playground ($16 per pax), musical performances on select nights, a festive market selling food, drinks, crafts and restaurants. There are also some light sculptures, the Luminarie, which were quite stunning but I could not fully appreciate this time round due to the pricey tickets. Oh, and fake snow.Even the Merry Medley display at the Flower Dome was quite lacklustre. It was very monotonous.Access to the Flower Dome, Cloud Forest and Children's Garden are as per normal. But be prepared for a detour if you are entering from Bayfront MRT or parking at the Meadows."
"When we talk about garden in the west, we think flowers and nature. To reach this garden, you walk from a concrete MRT tunnel to a man made concrete landscape with concrete walks, metal structures and totally planned and artificial looking walks. Granted, the whole structure is on reclaimed land and as such a major engineering accomplishment, but not since Louis XIV did we see the idea of human dominance over nature executed in such a thought through manner. The function of the garden is, at best, postmoderne, decontextualized from its urban context. Neither commercial, nor living, nor cultural aspects are integrated parts of this project. Art for art's sake but postmodernism is a thing of the past-so is the idea of this desert by the sea"
"We wished we didn't waste $56 here. Not worth it. The cloud dome was much better than the flower one. But still not worth it. Singapore is good for food and shopping. I've visited five times and now seen every tourist attraction there is to see. I'd recommend sticking to food and shopping. I've been spoilt by space and nature my whole life. This was artificial and felt like I was back at an airport. It was a hot walk over to Marina Bay Sands from Gardens by the Bay - we were soaked by the time we got there. Everyone we asked told us to walk and that getting a taxi wasn't worth it. Instead we had to buy new shirts at the mall- notably much more expensive than a taxi.We visited around 1-2pm and did not see the night lights. It's probably better at night, but I still question the price for what it is.It was also recommended that we visit Satay by the bay for affordable local delights. It appeared to be an overpriced hawkers market. Also quite a hot walk during the day.The whole thing felt like a tourist trap. But there are indeed many good reviews. I wish I'd paid more attention to the not so good ones!!"
Everything about this venue says artificial and tacky. Do not waste your money paying to enter The Cloud Forest or The Flower Dome. For the real thing go to the Botanical Gardens and pay $1 to see the Orchid Garden.
"When to flower dome crowded, a staff tear the wrong side of my ticket.When ask her about it, her reply ""I am just a part timer"".Saw a grey shirt guy, complain.Got brush off with ""Sorry, thank you"".Well done. Worst visit for all the local attraction I went to."
price is a ripoff. 2 domes with flowers 1 dome was full of dcandinavian christmas flowers and 500 kimd of cactus not really a scoop for a dane.other was tropical green flowers looked great but to charge this amount for this i find harsh. had higher expectations. changi airport have stunning decor for free so was expecting more.
Nothing much really. It's average garden. Maybe like 8th out of 10 things to do if you have nothing to do
"This is essentially a mountain of concrete covered with some plants and a waterfall. Manufactured tourism and quite soul-less. They also only show the cost of 2 a attraction pass for tourists (the flower dome is the other one) and only if you ask, they tell you the price of a single attraction."
Not impressed. No guides. Thought there would be more to see. Dancing light show was not worth the wait. I am trying as positive as possible.
"Another highly regarded attraction close to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel/Casino/Shopping complex? Having just spent a very pleasant morning to mid afternoon at the Singapore Botanical Gardens for free, we could not fathom why the entry charge here was $28 per person. A quick review of their promotional literature gave no justification for that spend so we opted out."
Everything was the same as their pictures on the internet ... and that's all. Nothing more or less. The trees are unique but incompatible with the surrounding. Packed with tourists and family with kids esp on holiday. That means it's not a place to relax but good for taking photo or quick hang out.
Went with my family and I think this place is overhyped. Both Flower Dome and Cloud Forest were not that great. Me and my wife were very much disappointed and thought we wasted our money. We visited Singapore Botanical Garden in the morning and later in the day we visited this place and it is nothing in front of Botanical Garden and would suggest people not to waste time and money here instead directly enter Botanical Garden and National Orchid Garden. Entering Botanical Garden is free and S$5 for National Orchid Garden.The best thing which we enjoyed here was the night show at Supertree grove. A must visit and I don't think you have to pay anything for that. Its just outside Flower Dome and Cloud Forest entrance.
If you want a nice view from a rooftop bar its a good place to be. Unfortunately the food does not live up to the expectations. The building and the rooms including the restrooms are a bit run down and should be renovated. Its really a pity since the location is really nice. The service is pretty good though and you feel welcomed.
This is a beautiful park to visit. The light show at night is better seen from a distance. A very pleasant place to visit and have a picnic.
"Unless you're into flowers and gardening plus surrounded by all tourist, then you will enjoy the place."
"Men made disaster, it feels very artificial non inspiring garden. Some areas has a nice view of the lake and canal. Everything is highly over priced to our opinion (We did the Flower Dome and the garden bus tour). The flower dome might be a state of the art structure but the inside garden and flowers are pretty poor. For #1 attraction in Singapore its a great disappointment for us."
"actuallay nothing to see besides the water falls (artificial), some flowers are fake built with legos"
"Though it took me years to finally head to the Gardens by the Bay (even with all my extensive years of visiting to Singapore); I finally mustered the motivation to go. In 2016.To be honest, it's nice and all but would I recommend people to go there? No not really.My experience was as follows; as with anything in life ""first impressions count"" and they did very clearly on this excursion... the staff were friendly enough, but were they engaging? No not at all. They just looked like it was just a job to them and weren't really interested about the patrons or try to get to know people visiting. They looked bored and would rather be somewhere else; even some attitudes that were very obvious that I noticed from staff in The Cloud Forest, which came through their tones when directing people. From the time I bought a $3 pass for the shuttle and throughout my 2-3hours I spent at the Gardens, it was clear the staff didn't really want to be there! Sad really.Though a lot of different things to try within, which means extra money so if you don't mind spending $40-50 on one outing then by all means; but there were probably only two things that I would recommend to try if you do go there:1. The Cloud Forest (which has the man made waterfall).2. The Indochine Restaurant (located in the Super-tree Grove).Some hot tips:If your a foreigner, then make sure you get a local friend/ family/ buddy to purchase tickets for the Cloud Forest on your behalf so much cheaper; otherwise you will be paying through the nose!Rather then do the OCBC walkway, especially if your looking for a view; instead pay $18 to go up to Indochine Restaurant which you get a free drink as well air-con with sights.This is especially compared to paying $8 for the walkway which is only from one tree to another (should have connected 2-3 trees to make a decent walkway). Also it can be quite windy on the walkway and no covering from the sun which is quite intense up there too.Now I may have possibly given a higher rating for this review if I had a chance to ride the Auto-Rider; but that was a flop as it only operates from 11am to 1pm daily which is pretty poor too.Overall I'm kind of glad it took me so long to finally to check out the Gardens by the Bay; as I really didn't miss out on much.Consolation prize:If your a couple then maybe worth going to visit as a romantic excursion, apart from that I would actually recommend you spend your money at Sentosa which is far more worth it!"
These gardens have a theme park feel to themDriven around on little trains to fake trees and gaudy lightsThe domes held interest but were again very fakeBotanic gardens are much better for garden lovers
The walkway linking the shops (from level 4) to the gardens by the bay is a nice fresh air walkway.... BUT.... the walkway is dangerous and lacking maintenance.While walking there yesterday a plank flew up and hit my mother in the leg sending her to the ground.We noticed many planks that have already been replaced and more that also need fixing.PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN WALKING ALONG THERE.
"I was expecting that Gardens by the Bay would be an magical place. But, as always, then the truth hits; I didn't find this place so magical; too many tourists with their smartphones and kidds. I'm still glad I went, now I don't have to go again. Oh and, the purple waterfall in Cloud Forest was nice!"
"Nothing really worth shouting. And with the current weather in Singapore, drink more water before setting off."
"Will only recommend if you are a plant-lover if not it might be boring to you. The two domes are in air-conditioned, so better to bring along a jacket. It pretty much just show case the different plants and don't expect any interesting activities there.Get the tickets for the two domes first and only get the OCBC skyway ticket when you are about to go to the skyway just in case the weather turns bad and there is no refund of tickets.I would actually recommend you to go for the segway at the marina bay sand (not the sentosa) as it will include a mini tour around the marina bay sand and the satay club beside gardens by the bay."
"Walking so far from Bayfront MRT Station, if you don't want to walk to far you must paid around s$3 for shuttle service to the main enterance of cloud forest and flower dome. Good place to visit if you like flower or any plants."
"Holiday camp mass tourism feeling in this overpriced hotel and bar.Not a ""classy"" establishment at all !"
"Not a fan of this place. Maybe it's better for kids as it tries to be somewhat educational, but it is too artificial. You have to pay to enter the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest - the latter has a nice indoor waterfall feature. If you want to visit a beautiful garden, go to the Botanic Garden instead, that is wonderful, and well worth paying to enter the Orchid Garden there."
"Try visiting in the late afternoon. If too humid hard to stay longer and enjoy as there is not much shade. Go on days when there is special events on will be more interesting. Most plants are young. If you opt for the entry that need payment to the special garden, you maybe able to experience more.There is limited food option if you are not too fuzzy. Otherwise, you may walk across to Marina Bay Sands with mote shopping and food options in an air con environment."
It probably is a once in Singapore to visit place. Unfortunately nothing amazing or interesting provided to western & continental visitors outside the South East Asia.
Did not find the place exciting or unique. Not worth the entry ticket price. The attempt to create huge trees using article props was commendable.
"A long walk for the elderly, not suitable so take the tram, which requires a fee. Flower Dome: Too artificial, too small. And expensive. Outside, lacklustre. Super tree is a one visit wonder. U know, this is Singapore, so everything is in tiny version."
This place is all but natural. It's too artificial. You feel like in a kindergarten as far as the environment is concerned.
"Was looking forward to this visit due to the many adverts promoting the place and good reviews from visitors but alas very disappointed at it's artificiality.Two giant airconditioned domes house a jumbled collection of flowers , many in pots , some look freshly transplanted and a man made waterfall in a metal structure with green plants on it and a metal walkway through it form the other attraction. All fake and stylised. I have to agree with the other reviewer that I had to laugh, this is not a garden, this is a garden centre. There are signs and posters promoting eco sustainability and green consciousness but I wonder if they have forgotten how much electricity is used by the many giant airconditioners to maintain the artificial temperature all year round. Perhaps that is why they need to charge an exorbitant fee of S$28!To be fair, there are structured open air lawns outside but no dogs or bicycles are allowed and I suppose if you live in a city of high rise buildings and have never experienced a real garden or seen flowers and plants growing naturally in their real environment, then perhaps a garden centre introduces you to flowers and plants you will otherwise not be able to see and allow you to take many selfies .Otherwise this is a pointless waste of time and money."
"I enjoyed the garden as it has thounsand types of flowers. But the visitor was too crazy. For next specific flower, maybe you might want to split to 2 or 3 sections of special flowers (in this case: tulips)"
Wasn't blown away by this place although we didn't go to any of the areas you had to pay extra for. In my opinion the botanic gardens are much more enjoyable and a lot quieter and peaceful.Didn't find the light show impressive either.Only positive is we caught a nice red sky from the sunset.
"Gardens by the Bay restaurant belongs to Indochine Group. In their Club St. outlet, they serve the very best Laab Kay (spicy chicken)salad and nam Kao (rice paper rolls) in town. At the Garden by the Bay outlet do NOT pick these dishes. Very Disappointing. Mike MA Mr owner pliizzzz do something about it."
"The gardens are beautiful and worth a visit. My advice would be to go for opening if possible to try and avoid the crowds.Despite many signs saying don't touch the plants or go on plant beds the amount of people pulling plants towards them to get a selfie was truly staggering. The damage was really apparent in the tulip beds. There are plenty of staff to observe, who predominantly look like bored teenagers and I did not see one of them do anything about this.The gardens advertise an audio tour which I was looking forward to, to find out a bit more. When I went to the visitor centre to pay for this I was asked for photo id.I did not have any and the staff member seamed genuinely surprised I wasn't carrying my passport around (who does?) Despite offering to leave a credit card or a large deposit I was not allowed to purchase a 4 dollar audio guide and all staff could do were quote terms and conditions at me, which is poor customer service in itself. Having travelled around the world this is the first time I have been asked for photo id. to purchase an audio guide in ANY attraction. The best part is they are advertising this audio tour at every point in both conservatories.I then tried to join a free guided tour to find out a bit more. It was a large group and a young man with a very quiet voice and no microphone was guiding the group. I could hear very little and what I heard was that he sounded largely disinterested, so I gave up after 2 minutes.This is well worth seeing, well planned and executed but take your passport if you want an audio guide and try and avoid crowds and selfie sticks!"
"We visited at night, with the lights on and there is a narrative story in English with the lights effect ... The place not crowded .. Have a good view of Marina Bay Sands"
Unless you are completely infatuated by flowers then I wouldn't bother paying the entrance fee.It was nice being inside the cool air-conditioning but I walked around both areas within one hour.
"Not bad not really nice. I prefer the real botanic garden in Singapore. This one is something like sterile, dead on the basis of animal live."
Beautiful but glasshouse entrance too expensive.Go there after 4pm because noon is too hot and humid.
"If you have a beautiful natural scenery back home, don't bother to come. It such a strange feeling to have a garden but surrounded by concrete and tall building. Only those grew up in concrete jungle would enjoy a little greenery..."
Maybe because is it rated #1 attraction in Singapore I was expecting more. It's ok but for flowers the botanical garden is much better.
"The stroll through the various gardens was definitely worth a visit. The gardens showcased various gardens such as the Malay, Chinese Gardens, large lake & fountains. However, the domes were quite a disappointment. The displays inside the dome were not well kept nor well presented. The flowers were sparce and obviously had seen better days! Many of the shrubs showed signs of neglect with brown foliage & dying branches.(The advertising brochures show a different display to the actual). There is a large waterfall with walkway towering behind the falls which takes you through a tropical rainforest display. The admission cost to visit both domes is expensive and definitely not worth the visit."
"everything is costly - the tickets, food, etc... and nothing really attractive to look at... the service is mediocre too with some staffs not able to speak english... it's the same as sentosa.. try to go other places... the zoo and bird park is much more fun.."
We didn't really enjoy this at all. Expected much better but nothing new to see here really so felt very disappointed. Some of the trees were impressive but felt that it was a waste of time and money.
Visited a couple of days ago. It was good to get out of the rain and it was lovely and cool but not much variation in the plants. The trees were good to see but seen better in other places so was disappointed sorry to say
"The gardens are undeniably spectacular, especially the indoor waterfall in the cloud forest dome and the sky-walk among the super-trees. However, the information boards don't tell you much about the plants. OK so I did not take the audio tour which doubtless provides more, but you should not have to do this to understand what you are seeing. Much of the information on the boards and the videos was generic platitudes on climate change rather than anything that enabled you to understand the plants you are looking at and the ecosystems in which they thrive. The whole feel of the place is more like a theme park rather than somewhere you can actually learn something. As a themepark or simply somewhere to amuse the kids its great. As a botanical gardens its a disaster."
"A very poorly run attraction. Was sent from Information Desk to wrong line, waited to reach front and then sent to another desk to purchase tickets on their shuttle for a two minute ride. Could have walked if Information people had provided good directions. The Flower Dome was filled with leftover Christmas decorations and flowers were less than exciting. There were some camellias, fuchsias and roses in bloom but certainly not worth the price. Cloud Forest better, but crowded. Tried to see the metal sculpture trees, but long lines to go to the top. Gret promotional marketing, but does not meet one's expectations."
"If you are not into artificially created nature or don't awe at names of exotic plants and flowers, this place is definitely not for you."
"I read many good reviews about supertree show but I was quite disappointed. Nothing special than pictures..I think the view outside of gardens by the bay (ex. MBS, Bayfront MRT station..) prefer to inside view."
"This is the major attraction in Singapore, yet it is dramatically overrated in my opinion. We have been twice once in the day and once at night for the light show. Day visit was boring to be honest and the light show, was anything but, it was quite literally a few colour changes on some large trees, very basic stuff really."
"As much as everything about the gardens by the bay being beautiful during this time of the year, it was also very crowded and a terrible disarray. The place was not very well lit, presumably to maintain the natural essence of the garden. There was zero crowd control. And it seemed like everyone was trying to get down & up this one poor staircase that led to the Christmas decorations or to exit. There were people carrying strollers up/down the staircase because the elevator had a long queue. Didn't see any sign boards to show visitors alternative route in and out the area. The directory/map, if you can find them at all in this madness, was useful. We managed to find a different but longer route back to the Bayfront station. In summary, love the place but visit during a non-peak period to truly enjoy. It's a park not a market."
Great place for families with kids but we went around Xmas time and it was very crowded. Long lines for taxis...took us two hours to get out.
We had beenin 2014 and this time we were disappointed as the music was very commercial all disney themes and the show only went fo 10 minutes .It was hardly worth battling the crowd and sitting on the floor for
"As a landscape architect the Gardens by the Bay were one of my principal reasons for visiting Singapore. However I found that they reminded me of the ill-fated garden festival sites that took place in the 1980/90s in the UK: lots of 'event spaces' squeezed into an area: a sense of impermanence and no overall unity. It's more of a family theme park than an actual garden. Lots of concrete, tarmac and metal poles. The theme gardens in the main do not represent the themes stated but just have some information boards on that theme. The Cloud Dome is impressive but is essentially a hollow concrete cone covered with plants; again with its statues it's more like a theme ride (which is fine for kids). The Flower Dome was partly given over to a rather cheesy Xmas grotto. Overall fine for family day out with an element of environmental education, but not for the serious garden enthusiast who would be much better off visiting the Botanical Gardens."
"Singapore dreams of a white Xmas but will never get one, but the music is running non stop, in November!Xmas Kitsch was everywhere in the garden, spoilt evrything, the Chinese were crazy about it and couldn`t stop photographing and getting in everybodies way.Don`t bother going there because the Botanical Gardens beat it by miles."
"There are many lighting decorations and yes, it's beautiful after nightfall, but other than that, any natural lover will find it boring or even disgusting by staring at those fabricated-designed plants, totally NO SENSE of NATURE."
"bad experience. Seems like they have issues communicating internally. brought a relative on a wheelchair with a helper and when I asked the counter staff how many tickets were required, they said 2. but when i stopped at the entrance to the dome, they shouted at me to stop as the tickets were wrong.such a disgrace GBTB."
Even though they came up with some technologies to foresee clean water and all this place feels a bit like an attraction parc. The flower dome wasn't to spectaculair compared to the other one which is nicer.
"What do you do in a country that doesn't have much to do? Visit a vertical garden!Yes, they've figured nice ways to grow plants in a really small place and the variety of plants is nice, I wouldn't keep it on the list of things I would visit Singapore for.But if you're there and have time to kill.. Well :-)"
It's nice if you're okay with manufactured nature.I personally prefer the Botanics. More natural and a integral part of Singapore's heritage.
"It's only ok, you may have a feeling of too artificial since things are too well organized and with a few giant fake plam lighting tree.may amazed in the first minute but then will easily feel nothing much else soonThere are 2 domes that you can go inside but honestly I think it's over price. Plants insider the flower garden is better than the other one, so if you really want to try, pick that flower one instead of the waterfall one.However I do recommend this place at late night timing if you want a walk and maybe a small group of friends to hang out. It's open till early am. But I won't recommend it in the day time.And don't even try the overhead bridge. What's the point??"
"Super hot and bad landscaping for the flower dome!! I don't know what they are trying to showcase to someone who is not an architect or worse, someone who is a landscape designer. shame though, seems like they spent a lot of money in the process of making this."
"Overall it was an anticipated visit. I came to see the Tulips!My only qualms was the rain came and I was cut off from enjoying the walk under the super trees (I was stuck in cloud forest area due to the rain).Oh and when I was waiting for a cab at a cab area with no special railing / queuing rows (people just line up in a line) and as the people infront of me (a whole group of them) suddenly went out from the queuing line to get into their cab, an Indian employee of the garden, wearing yellow-coloured safety vest, shouted loudly and kind-of rudely called me to say I should walk up to the top of the line because he said the queuing line starts there. I know he meant good but my cab was also almost there - a bit far off, though, but if not for the drizzling situation I would have run away from the line, too. My point here is he shouldn't have shouted. He could have talked nicely. Because of him, it made my visit to the Gardens a very bad experience!"
"Gardens By The Bay is easily one of the top ""must go"" attractions in Singapore, right next to Marina Bay Sands. Most of the park is free and walking through different parts of the garden using a map is both convenient and lovely. The only entrance fees that are necessary is if you choose to go up the OCBC skyway, Cloud Forest (dome) and the Flower Dome (dome). To get the double pass for both domes, its $29SGD, although highly worth it if you don't go to Singapore regularly.At any part of the garden, it will be well maintained and work will be done everyday throughout the park.There are eateries near the main entrance there and even a Maccas, but bringing a bottle of water would be handy.Also, at the Supertree Grove, I highly recommend being there for the light show (Garden Rhapsody) that starts everyday at 7:45, 8:45 and 9:30."
Took my mum who enjoyed it. Not for me as I find type of thing boring. If you like looking at plants and flowers the botanical gardens are better and free
"We did not enjoy it as much as we did with the Botanic Garden. Garden by the Bay feels far too synthetic and ""showy"". Also far toi many visitors!!"
"We went to Garden By The Bay on Singapore's National Day, that turned out to be a big mistake! He place was way too much crowded and it was even hard to walk! However we went in and started taking pictures. Then we went to Cloud Forest, i loved this place! There were amazing tress and plants which mesmerized me, but the most attractive was the waterfall which was giving cool breeze around. It took around 20mins to complete the cloud forest tour and then we went to Flower Dome. This place is full of flowers, different kinds of flowers which many never heard of.We had real trouble in having lunch because all the places were packed and huge que everywhere! We were hungry but nothing to do, joined the que and after about 15mins we gave orders.I'm pretty sure that this place is not as crowded everyday, any other day visiting this place would be great!"
Not my cup of tea. It is too hot to walk around on a sunny day and quite easy to get temporarily lost inspite of the signage. Bt it is an unusual experience and popular with some of my friends.
Fascinating if you're going as a family with kids. We didn't really enjoy this much. We had gone at night and some of the artificial gnarly trees look plain scary.Super trees were awesome though!
"Take the Eden Project, UK, mix withe the Australian Outback, add a dash of Far North Queensland and mix with a slice of New Zealand and you have the Singapore equivalent. Interesting, but no WOW factor for us. Skywalk not operating due to thunderstorms. Pricey attraction, seniors card not acceptable."
It was a nice light with different colors show and started around 19.45h. Because it's free entrance I appreciate it but it was not that spectaculair.
"Impressive architecture but ultimately disappointing gardens which fail to represent the local cultural heritage with gardens themed around European fairy tales and a fake "" rainforest"" walk. Feels artificial and shallow."
"The place has been well landscaped, but don't be fooled by the word ""garden"" - this is more like a theme park. Poorly signposted, so not easy to find your way around, and don't even think about going there during a particular holiday or festival as it is too busy. For real gardens, look to the Botanic Gardens near Orchard Road instead."
"May be my expectations were high with positive reviews. And also I am sure much work have been put into this. But, I find the gardens all rather fake eg. The big trees are actually towers inspiring to be the former - the same theme goes with with everything; the mountain, waterfall and various continents. The sculptures are very nice though"
Not really the best attraction in Singapore. The variety of plants is interesting but I don't think it worth's a visit. The light show outside was better.
its waste of time and money...no need to visit it from inside..can see its beauty at night from outside or from hotel marina bay sands
"Contrary to what others think, Gardens by the Bay, in my opinion, has nothing much to offer. Everything in the domes are imported from other countries. It seems to be an exhibition of flowers rather than a garden. As with everything in Singapore, this is man-made, just a tourist trap. Just after the opening of the gardens the flowers looked decent, but after a year or two they are not as attractive, perhaps due to poor maintenance, especially in the exterior without the entrance fee. There is no need to make a special visit unless this modern and man made garden really interests you"
"SuperTree is uniquely beautiful. Stick with cocktails on the roof and skip the really skipable food. We had a great time, but I felt badly that my host paid so much for less than forgettable food. You will have a great time with drinks and then MOVE ON!"
"Confusing, small and boring. Confusing as we used the map to see everything and couldn't find the chinese garden. No signs pointing in the right direction. Finally when we had a walk on the sky path, we saw where to go. My g/f got food poisoning from the satay stand."
"I never even made it inside the two terrarium houses! Don't go on a weekend. There is only one ticket office (and it's rather expensive to tour the whole thing). Hundreds of visitors queued up with only two ticket sellers. Not at all well planned, considering this is Singapore.I explored the entire extensive outdoor area and found it mostly unremarkable save for a section with very large anamorphic bushes (ala 'The Shining'). It would, however, be a cool place (and big enough) to jog or rollerblade and evidently it is permitted there.i advise the Botanic Gardens instead but maybe if you book tix online or thru a hotel concierge, the terrariums are worthwhile.I will give them a miss next time though."
Worthwhile going if you love plants. But simply very artificial. Convenient to go and walk around. Take 3 to 4 hours to complete.Going in the late afternoon and see the night show at 7:45pm before you go for dinner.The evening light show is good.
Nothing much to shout out. It is just like botanical garden but in an air con room. 1-2 attractions are free and the rest is payable. Felt like a scam. Restaurants are killers in price.
The lights display in the evening was super. But the food was not that great. Portions were small and quite pricey.
"Singapore apparently spent vast sums on the development of this area and I really wanted to like it. However, I found the trees and the domes on reclaimed land just a clinical, artificial backdrop for selfie-taking visitors. It just made me miss real nature even more. If you are a visitor though - do visit! It is kind of compelling with its weird, expensive artificiality with a world after the apocalypse feel. The trees look amazing at night and the view from Indochine is spectacular. However, in the long term, this doesn't feed the soul at all - it is a one shot deal for me."
"Went there for the first time, didnt go to the flower dome as I heard the flowers were mostly dead, I felt it was a little waste of my time and if I had an option to return, I wont.. It was alittle boring"
"I don't work in the forestry / nursery industry but am an ardent fan of all big flower shows in Singapore n abroad. This 2015 ""Tulipmania"" festival at Gardens By The Bay is a huge letdown. Whoever are in the design team clearly has little love for tulips or even flowers. Yes I see tulips ( not many though) but where is the delight, the magic ? Charm ? While the conceptualisation of a ""fairytale"" tulip show creates anticipation, it is all a lot of smoke n mirrors : there is hardly any small or medium tulip floral arrangements or amongst flowers in the flower dome (except for the entrance after the doors open) n even at the ""Meadow"", where big displays are, the candy house is so fake coz it is made of cardboard. How much does it take to build a real timber house ? C'mon design team, you can do better :D The quality of the displays is ""C"" grade( n I am being kind here) . There seems a mismatch in the proportions : the candy house is so big n the doll display next to it is not synchronised. The displays r so stiff they don't even warrant a pause or a picture. Frankly I won't take my visiting relatives or foreign friends to 2015 tuilpmania. It is embarrassing . Please do a better job next year . Where is the Singaporean spirit - ""either do it well or don't do it"" ? For the first time, I find it humiliating this is a Singaporean flower show"
"My husband and I headed to Gardens by the Bay after my Mother in Law visited it and enjoyed it. I was aware she was most pleased by it being cool, as she had been struggling with the local heat, however I had hoped there were other plus points. Sadly not. We went at the weekend, and the place was packed with people meandering along the paths, their only attention on the plants was to select them for the prettiest selfie back drop. Seriously, it was astounding. In order to try and get away from the narcissism we found ourselves just continually trying to find somewhere to enjoy the nature, but alas it was impossible with the crowds. The design of the place is so sanitised: concrete everywhere and nothing that says garden to me. I guess this is all relative, and for Singaporeans Gardens by the Bay is an abundance of wildlife! But for us Europeans gagging for a little nature and horticultural inspiration, it was a huge disappointment."
I wasn't impressed with this dome at all. It was cold and not very interesting. If I had to do it over again I'd only do the could forest.
"It's a well laid out garden, although more signages would be nice. More shady trees along the walkway would be more awesome. The charges to access the conservatories however, are prohibitive and I chose not to go in into either one. The garden is getting quite dated however and you can tell from the facilities as well as the paths and plants."
The domes are interesting by the price is too high and the flora is lacking. Go to the botanical gardens if you want the real thing.
"I am sure there is tons of money poured into build this. But let's face it, Singapore does not have a skyline compare with other countries like NYC, Hong Kong, Boston, so even if you go up to the walkway, there is nothing much to see. The ""garden"" is not as big as expected but the good thing is you can walk through the garden to Sands hotel and shopping center. I went there twice but no taxi either time. So don't think you can get a taxi from there to anywhere. And twice is more than enough"
"have seen much better. the flower area is so fake. if in Singapore, this is definitely one to skip! in addition, too many people"
"This is not a typical garden full of greenery, birds and other wildlife as one can expect.The place is rather fake with too much of concrete floors and not much way to escape... No birds in the greenhouses for example.The waterfall is a scream, all fake, with a lot of concrete again, coming right from a sci-fi movie.The A/C is very cold, especially at the waterfall.Did not manage to go onto the treetop walk as it was closed because of a drizzle.Lucky I did not pay the enormous fee for the visit as it was an organised business trip."
"I love Singapore and I love it that there is a lot of green space, public art and fun things to do for the local and the tourist. This place is great green space but the 2 Domes are expensive and they just seem to be giant dioramas erected to pry a dollar out of the tourist pocket. The cloud dome for me was the better of the two. It is ironic however that the journey through it ends with a lecture about global warming - a lecture given on a massive screen in an air conditioned concrete structure built on reclaimed land housing enormous artificial trees that are ablaze with electric light every night."
A large park with couples of man-made tall trees. Two chilly-houses for flora display are in the gardens. Probably they are good. I didn't go to the chilly-houses but the remaining parts are suitable for people who stay in Singapore for a long while and is a good place just to walk. Not good for people with a tight schedule.
"Flower garden was disappointed because:room temperature was so cold,many kind of flowers were normal (i.e. we can see them usually) for Japanese,I wanted to see many kind of tropical and subtropic flowers."
"After watching and waiting for three years to get to visit this wonderful attraction I have come away in tears. Everything was as spectacular as I had imagined. We purchased our tickets for the little electric buggy to take us around the park and to give us an overview of the whole area. We were told ""only two stops"" so when you get off here at the two pavilions you are picked up again around there. All very good but after being driven around in circles and then walking around in circles within the two towers when we came out to again catch our buggy there was no sign to say catch buggy here, just a sign pointing which way to go fromthe buggy. So we started walking in the direction of the sign only to find that there was no pick up spot as we walked and several of the buggies passed us by we waved our tickets to say we have paid but they refused to stop again saying ""only two pick up spots"". It was 35o hot & sunny, my husband and I are in our late 60s and no idea which way was out. So we spent several hours walking round and round trying to find where we should be to pick up a taxi to get back to our hotel. We were not the only ones along the route trying to get a lift, many elderly groups were also along the way. I would suggest a large sign that states ""BUGGY STOP HERE"" Then everyone would know just where they had to wait to get back on the buggy..what was going to be my most sort after event in Singapore ended up being just horrible and I ended up hot, sweaty, angry and in tears."
"Cold inside. Much a do about nothing. It really did not live up to my expectations. Lots of trees and plants, but so what? Better take a trip to Botanical Garden."
This is one of the most disappointing attractions in Singapore so far. It's a poorly-constructed hotchpotch of messy ideas thrown together and lacks character.The mainland staff at the gift shop were loud and vulgar. Everything here is clearly overpriced. Also shocking were the stalagmites/tites on display. These natural wonders take millions of years to form and shouldn't be cut down for entertainment value. Too bad.
Well all i can say it is overraed but for singapore i think it is good to have so much greenery but nothing to rave about average
"This is a good place to take kids for some water play and walk around some gardens with about a million other people. You can enjoy some average food sitting on some reclaimed land in a man-made creation which includes some fake trees which are slowly being covered with real creeping plants. This is the problem with Singapore - there is really nothing on offer for the tourist. Shopping is expensive, food quality has dropped, there are too many people, there is almost nothing of the authentic Asian experience left."
"Very hot, very concretey, botanic gardens are much better. Too built and not enough of a garden feel. Cloud done was closed when we were but flower done was open. It was ok but botanic gardens are the place to go."
"Not too impressed, as we felt the whole experience was quite artificial... not somewhere I would visit again"
A steel pipe pouring water for a waterfall in the gardens... a tourist trap and rather disappointing.
"The gardens are nice but given the cost of each dome, we felt that they were not good value. You even have to pay for a shuttle from the MRT station to the main entrance.Worth a visit but will not be rushing back."
"The area is big, all man made gardens, entry to 2 domes is expensive and there is not much inside you can walk around in under 1 hour for both domes and you are done, outside tree tops are nice but nothing to write about."
I thought Gardens by the Bay is really beautiful but was not impressed when I'm already there. Went with my partner around 5-7 in the evening and there are a lot of bugs and insects biting while taking pictures. Better bring some insect repellent if you have sensitive skin.
The domes are pretty lame expecially the flower dome where exhibits change regularly be bringing in new potted plants. And rearranging them following teh festive occasions. Pretty tacky at times. The air Conditioning is a good respite from the afternoon heat.
These are artificial 'gardens' in glass houses giving an entirely superficial quality - much hyped by locals and tourists
"If you're looking to escape the mayhem of Singapore's busy streets then this is a great place to come and relax for a few hours to meander around... but I was pretty underwhelmed by the overall experience (although the educational units were interesting even though they felt a bit budget"") - and I was overwhelmed by the price. In comparison to the many other wonderful places Singapore has to offer, I think there are better (e.g. the must-visit Botanical Gardens) but this is also next to the Marina Bay Sands so a good break from shopping/exploring etc and you can go watch the sun go down on the Skywalk afterwards..."
"If you're from Malaysia, Indonesia, or maybe any other tropical country..this garden is not really one to visit for you. For instant, you're a tourist on a flight transfer and have couple of hours to spare to see Singapore, then just skip this Garden of your itinerary.First, the location of the Garden from MRT is very far, unlike what they say in pamphlet or any other Singapore brochure. Then, the Garden itself is big. but the array of flowers and plants are not so beautiful or interesting. To me, its more of a garden for the people of Singapore itself to see and wander around, since they're always too busy to get a holiday and visit a proper gardens in other countries. I've been to gold coast aussie, the garden and parks there is more vibrant, beautiful & attractive. Just to prove a point, the day I made a visit here, they put on a free Chinese movie on a big screen for the people of the republic to see and enjoy!! I mean...for real??Apart from that, there are a number of restaurant here. Many are not halal and the only halal restaurant is Texas Chicken!! (IN A BEAUTIFUL MARINA GARDEN). But there is a satay by the garden food place thingy, but I have to warn you, it is sooo far away from where all the action is...Ohh, another thing is the canopy walk or whatever they call it. They charge SD8 for a walk up there among the big pillars in a hanging bridge. The thing is, the walk is only 5 or 10 meter long!!! and they charged you for it!!!Anyway, for me, its a big misdirection to people if they make this place a must for all tourists as I don't think its a must, unlike Orchard Road or Mustafa..but then again, its just a humble opinion."
"Nice engineering to showcase. I appreciate the investment and spawning of expertise to engage scientists and engineers. Otherwise, to a tourist, it offers little, other than probably enjoying a good jog or walk in and around the lake and park."
"The two main attractions were the flower dome and cloud forest - a ticket for these was $28, which was ridiculous when you compare them to the Night Safari ($35) and Bird Park ($20), which have much more to do and see. It was impossible to spend more than an hour at the two domes.The flower dome was really bad - there was a Christmas fruit display but after Christmas a lot of the fruit was rotting (e.g. strawberries were black and mushy).The price needs to be reduced by at least $10 for this to be ok value for money."
"I found Gardens by the Bay an impressive mass of asphalt and concrete (you can watch the photos I posted), the outdoors are dotted by ugly decorations and the whole thing looks environmentally unsustainable from my point of view. The Greenhouses cost 28 billion a year, more than half a billion a week. Other 29 billions are required for the outer gardens. And the final result? A lot of asphalted roads and empty concrete walls, gardens looking very artificial with none or poor explanations.The super-trees show was ok, though very short, I suggest not to pay to go on the Skywalk, you can lie down at the bottom of the trees and see the wind moving the leaves, whereas from the top you will have to stand and watch closer how ugly the concrete trees are (beside having to pay a 10 $ fee)."
"This new attraction is definitely a good place to miss, unless you needed to kill 2-3 hours of your time before another event. Unnatural and unimpressive, the two maim attraction is so commercialised, that it does not resemble a garden!"
"Gardens By The Bay is an audacious project but it's all wrong, IMHO. The Singapore government spent billions of dollars on 'greenifying' a construction site and now charges tourists exorbitant fees to visit it, but is planning to drive a new 8-lane highway through an historic heritage site and area of natural beauty, and sink a new MRT line right through the middle of the Central Catchment Nature Reserve - something isn't quite right, there. Don't go to Gardens By The Bay - go to Bukit Brown before it's destroyed, and go to the Nature Reserve before it's lost."
"Strangely artificial place. Large metal trees where supposedly a spectacular light show was worth watching. Goes on at 2030 h for 15 minutes, but was very disappointing. Not worth waiting for."
"We are in our 60's and disabled to some degree, in their directions they do not mention the 1400 metre walk from the Bayfront station to their shuttle service. Nor does their information warn you that, if there is a thunder storm about the shuttle service stops operation ! This is Singapore ! Thunderstorm, what's the chance of that ? They lost our $"
"Go to the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and look down on the gardens and save your money.Anywhere that charges you S$11.50 for a very small cup of coffee is a blatant rip off which is what I was charged in the Flower Dome. Frankly, the flowers look tired and the variety VERY disappointing."
"Nice views but the gardens are not impressive. Very expensive, but you can just visit the outside gardens which are free but don't have much to show."
There really is not much to see here. Everything feels so artificial and the plants are not very exotic.
Other than seeing a couple of large structure that are supposed to look like trees there is not much to do here.
"This must be a treat for Singaporeans who do not travel and thus have not seen real plants in their natural blooms. Tourists will not be keen to travel all the way to Singapore to see transported from their home countries, in an unnatural, artificially propped up environment."
"First of all, I don't understand why it is so special....... I mean, didn't you see a nice natural park before? The most uncomfortable thing that I found is.....the garden is over-planned and made with over perfection that gave me an artificial feeling.....and this so called natural garden is right beside the crazy Marina Bay hotel that made the garden even more artificial (I don't understand what people found in this 3 towered stupid hotel....petronas Twin tower of KL has much better view, architectural design, style and creativity than this one).Maybe my expectation was different..... but to me, it was a complete turn off.I wont go back there again...... no way!"
I do not know why there is such rave reviews as anyone who know gardening can see that the gardens have been thrown together and that many of the plants especially planted outside are very stressed and were not trimmed properly at all.If it had healthy plants properly trimmed it would be outstanding. I think they wanted to try to hard.Any way walking around gave us plenty of exercise which was great.The sun was not baking down so it was not bad even though we were definitely hot at the end.What they have tried to do with the land is incredible. They came close but fell short in our opinion.
1. Found the place to be very artificial in its setup2. My colleagues from other countries liked it3. No shed from garden to restaurant.....difficult when rains4. Staff a little unpleasant......untypical of singapore
"For the cost of admission into the various attractions this place is just not worth it. We love Botanical gardens and this was such a disappointment as there are almost no special trees, bushes, plants and flowers. I find more interesting specimens in my own garden!!. A great place for Singaporeans to escape their apartments but as a garden for visiting and delighting in wonderful plants and trees it was ordinary"
"Hot day, very little grass, grumpy security guards that told us scooters were unwelcome and directed us out of the park to the dam at the end of the reservoir. This was followed by highly overpriced coffees and bottled water.Avoid."
"I visited both the Cloud Forest and the Flower Dome, and I didn't like either. They feel weirdly empty and artificial. The Flower Dome was really nothing special, the only section I liked was the Desert section. I went during the Tulipmania. It was totally overcrowded with tacky (German?) music coming out of speakers between the flowers. Aweful.Even though it's not advertised you can also buy tickets for one conservatory only, if you are not resident of Singapore."
"It simply didn't impress me. It felt a bit contrived. The ""supertrees"" were just a ridiculous manmade attraction. Lacked a natural, outdoor gardens appeal."
"The walk to the Gardens By the Bay is fairly long. Going there, I went through the Marina Bay Sands and up the escalator that seemed to go through the roof. I had been walking through the Sands the night before so i knew where the elevators were. They bring you to a roof walkway that goes over the highway to the Gardens by the Bay side. At first I wasn't sure if that walkway was open or not, or if you had to pay, but going through there was no problem. You actually only have to pay for certain areas and that is when you're well over to the other side, actually IN Gardens of the Bay.It was raining the whole morning/afternoon i visited and only had about an hour or , so i decided to check out the Flower Dome, since it was enclosed. There is a long distance from the entrance to the actual domes, so make sure you do have an umbrella because you can get soaked, but the walk is actually fine. They have some trams but they didn't seem to run frequently (not sure if you have to pay), and they also sold ponchos.If you only have time to visit one dome, the price is a little cheaper and the woman at the counter didn't hassle me or anything -- but i did mention i only had time to visit one and asked how much it would be, because i think the stated price includes the two domes.Honestly, i was expecting much more from the Flower dome and was not too impressed. There was a beautiful large display area in the middle, but the other separate ""gardens"" were actually pretty small, and the entire dome itself, was actually much smaller than i imagined it would be. I had just come back from a trip to Cape Town and perhaps it was the visit to Kirstenbosch that made me unimpressed with the Flower Dome. I didn't see any proteas at the South African Garden section even though they were noted on one of the signboards (perhaps i was unlucky).On the other hand, some of the other plants and trees were very impressive and unique. I love taking pictures of flowers, so i still spent the full hour of my time there and you can get some great shots of the flowers inside the dome. From what i can recall, the info blurb content seemed more random than meaningful.I was not able to visit the skywalk or the other outside free areas due to the rain and my time restriction, but i would say the price of visiting the dome was a bit overpriced. If you are going, I would definitely prepare to be there for a few hours, to be able to enjoy the different areas.I would definitely go back on a non-rainy day to see what i missed the first time around."
"If you are uo for a walk it might be fine but save your time and money to get into the dooms. Its just some planted flowers whoch you can see even better in open nature, absolutely not worth the money."
"This garden have 4zone: malay, china, india, colonial. For me very2 not interesting and very hot.The only thing that i found are1. Nice building2. Nice sceneryMay be for the singaporean who want just for hanging out, this garden would be niceHmm they got also, secret garden (they named it), inside they made artificial waterfall. But the entrance fee expensive"
I'm not a nature lover but I usually find parks/gardens bearable but I was beyond bored at this place. Maybe I missed the good parts...? Some good places for photos though. I'd only recommend this place if you are nearby Marina Bay Sands and have an hour- two hours to waste.
"It was quite boring when i was there as it was raining and the flowers were more or less the same. However is an air conditioning room so it was quite comfy and cooling. I find it a bit pricey just to view trees in this area. If you're not a plants or trees lover, you can avoid this place in order to save time."
"Looks good from a distance but close up the design appears to have been rushed or is very amateurish. Entrances and exits are not designed well. Steps are in the wrong place. One area does not flow well to the other. Some of the design choices and positioning of items such as seating, shelter, steps seem to be an afterthought or made by inexperienced designers. Gaudy Colouring, tarmac pedestrian areas, postars are remind me of bus shelter from the 70's.It is worth going for the amazing architecture of the greenhouses and the engineering aspects of the large artificial tree project but the detailed landscape design and lack of thought lets the place down. It could have been an amazing opportunity to show quality landscape design.It is not a botanical garden as the plants are supplemented by ornamental varieties but than it is not a show garden as the planting areas do not have a 'designed' element to them.A lot of people seem to be lost or looking for shade. It will need the plants to mature to deflect from the shortcomings. Some of the major areas may need a revamp to make them workable particularly outside the eating areas and entrance/exit points. They may need to cordone off some of the steps etc as they are totally unpractical."
The flowers are not exotic and green plants are more than ordinary. Do not expect to see very beautiful waterfall features with the feel of walking in a beautiful skywalk atmosphere. Won't go again.
"The gardens look magical from a distance, and its probably best to leave them that way. There doesnt seem much there and at night it has the feeling of being closed."
"It is ok the but for the price it is crazy I expected something more, the huge trees are still not covered with plants... they need at least 6 months more, Disapointed"
"poorly design.i am not too sure if the architect or designers are from singapore...they fail in one aspect.singapore has a hot and humid climate, and if not it will be raining.they are obviously no sheltered walkways to provide shade from the scorching sun, or cover from the rain.if you do visit the place, dress really light and bring umbrellas...even umbrella would not cover you from lightnings!the content of the gardens is weak, the experience is poor...it does not give you the ""wow"" factor!food and beverage is slightly expensive compare to other areasaccessibility is poor, especially if it rains with lightnings.."
"I was there in September on a weekend with my Aunt, her husband, their children, my uncle, his wife and his son. Major disappointment I felt there. I wouldn't say I'd enjoy the place because there were waaaaaaaaaaaay too many people. We wanted to eat at one of their eateries but it was waaaaaaaaaaaaay too crowded. We thought of ordering a sandwich but we had to wait for 45 minutes. In the end, we left the place and left for somewhere else instead. Better buck up, folks!"
Plants withering.Near accident at escalator as the floor is slippery. A Hugh disappointment on the man made waterfall. I understand it is man made but at least can you please hide the pipes.
"I went right after a trip to botanical gardens in Singapore. It was a sharp contrast. Botanical is free while parts of the Gardens by the Bay need an entrance fee. the structure looks ugly (apparently the inspiration is from mangosteens). a lot of people were there, very touristy."
Enjoyed a lovely stroll through the two domes and the park. There was plenty of information about the many and varied plants. The lift to the top of the tropical dome and walk back down provided and interesting dimension to the understanding.My only complaint is that it includes a large display of stalactites and stalagmites all of very considerable size which must have taken millions of years to grow. For a places that promotes saving the planet and the environment it is simply not acceptable to have cut these down and removed them from their natural environment. If it had not been for this I would happily have given a 5 overall rating.
"The gardens by the bay are certainly very nice to go. But the climate of Singapore makes it almost too exhausting to do so. If you absolutley want to visit the place (and yes there is enough to see), dress very lightly, take tons of water with you and learn to walk very slowely."
"I didn't enter to the main hall that was due to the queue was extremely long. They should provide online ticket purchase to avoid the crowd or pre delivered the ticket for the tour agent.I do not suggest to go on afternoon because you won't see the light effect and the whether is extremely hot. I went on Sunday afternoon, the place was very crowded with tourist."
"If the opening hours of your garden is until 9pm, you should install adequate lighting to take care of guests who enter 1 or 2 hours before that time! If you do not install adequate lighting, please close the garden when the sun sets which is at 7pm!We arrived at 7:30pm expecting to admire the plants in the dome.But it was so dark inside that I could not see anything! (Well that's an overstatement, I could see a lot of trees and flowers in one dome, a lot of trees and a waterfall in another dome, but all in black shades) Stairs are not well-lit (come on, use technologies like LEDs) and it would be a matter of time before someone trips over and sues the government. Signage is unlit as well. So don't expect to make out what plants you are looking at. I used my iPhone flashlight as lighting to help me look at the flowers. Ridiculous.The supertrees outside the domes are beautiful at night though. (and this part is free!)I guess the best time to visit would be to start at 5 or 5:30pm for the 2 domes to make sure the trees and flowers are still visible, and then walk out to see the supertrees in the dark at around 7pm after the sky darkens."
"Why pour billions of dollars into making something that nature can do better, for free?Gardens by the Bay to me, will only be enjoyable for people who has never experienced real nature - real high mountains, real cloud forests. How can this even remotely simulate what walking through Huangshan is like, for example?Perhaps this is the concept behind the design - to prepare our young for the bleak future that there will be no nature left for people to enjoy, that even plants have to be cultivated in museums that is the 'Flower Dome' and 'Cloud Forest'. Perhaps that is why, the designers treated visitors to that depressing video presentation of our bleak future before exiting from 'Cloud Forest'.All in all, the whole place screams artificiality. To me, it's really a big-budget vanity project managed by some uninspired people.If you like authenticity and natural scenery, give this place a miss."
"The gardens are not worth visiting for the price overseas visitors have to pay.We paid $124 (without the sky walk) for a family of 5 while our friends who are Singapore residents paid half that.The gardens have still not been completed, work is continuing.The gardens have not fully established so compared to the Singapore Botanic gardens (which are free) they do not even compare yet.If there has a bit of rain the sky walk is closed.The flower dome had hardly any flowers in it.The Cloud forest was pretty cool.My suggestion is to come in a year or two when the plants are more established and impresive."
"The main and latest attraction near Marina Bay Sands area is just a big artificial garden. The main free accessing garden lacks of enough shady walkways and resting places to combat the forever scorching heat of Singapore. The flower dome was disappointing. What greeted me was lotsa trees and plants instead of 'flowers' as the place of name implies. The overall layout and settings of the flowers were messy and didn't exactly bring out the beauty of each flowers. The different theme garden lacks of individualistic feel. The main good thing about the place is providing an educational lessons to the kids of the flora and fauna. The clouds dome was equally disappointing but the kids might enjoy the fake waterfalll and being like in a 'avatar' place minus the beautiful creatures. Im sure tourist from temperate countries have seen more beautiful and exotic flowers and nicer gardens than this big fake and hot garden. The lights shows in the evening were a short display of rainbow colors that you may find it worth staying to watch if you don't need to wait long for it, if you find yourself having to wait more than hour for it, please don't waste your time. I would suggest planning this trip at about late afternoon say about 4 or 5. That's when the heat is slowly disappearing and you'll feel more comfortable strolling around gardens, enough time to explore the domes then catch the light shows at about 745pm."
"The experience started badly with having to queue for 45 mins with only two customer service assistants for 100's of tourists. The tourist price is higher than the residents price of entry. Hardly fair since it is mostly tourists who visit. You have a choice of two gardens, paying more if you want to do both. We chose the flower garden (not the clouds one) thinking we would see some local floral exhibits, only to be presented with snapshot gardens from other countries and predominantly showcasing Australian flora. What a disappointment! We didn't travel to Singapore to see the same plants we have in our gardens at home, and pay for the privilege. A complete waste of money. Take a walk thru the gardens and parklands surrounding the two domes, there are more interesting things to see and it's free."
"My family and I visited this grand attraction on last Sunday (12/08/2012). It is an amazing gardens. However the services of the staff were far beyond expectations. When I stood alone in front of the information counter queue line to try to get information on this beautiful attraction. A guest was just walked straight through to the information counter and ignore totally the sign displayed at the entrance of the queue stating that please queue here for information. I was surprised that he was being served by the reception staff. It seemed that the staff at the counter has totally ignored my existence. Later when I queued at the ticketing counter to buy tickets for the entry of the Domes. I noticed that a guest whom was in front of me was offering to buy tickets for the third parties and I was shocked to see that once again she was being served by the ticketing agent despite of the fact that many people were queuing behind . I raised my concern on this improper handling to the duty personnel and its seemed that they were unfazed by such instances. No apology was given and when I requested for the email address of the top management, he even asked me whether I was overdoing it. I am annoyed over these instances and can't believe that the staff can tolerate and allow such practice to happen in this world class attraction. ."
"As an appreciator of public spaces, I visited the ""super trees"" and the conservatories recently.Is it a parody on the theme of ""Avatar""? ""World Class Chia Pets(TM?)."" Or, as others have asked - a scene from Alice in Wonderland""?Large amounts of concrete and steel, with stuff trying to grow out of them looks like an experiment in increasing the ""heat island effect"" of the area, rather than the intended ""eco-tourist destination"" touted by some. One hopes that the rest of the area will benefit from longstanding efforts elsewhere to increase tree canopy, and to shade walkways, so that the are will be more pleasant.Let's see how this might evolve. But I've heard rumours that the irreplaceable Singapore Botanic Gardens might be downgraded in favour of this contrivance. I certainly hope not. That would be a double-compound tragedy."
This is yet another overrated thing to do in Singapore. There are to may supernice real parks to walk around in in this city for this average artificial one to be justified. Long line for tickets. And the bathroom was disgusting.
"I had the chance to see the gardens within 2 days from the opening, so it was no entrance fee except for the pavilions. My understanding was that there are some hanging gardens, very spectacular. What I found instead were some metallic pillars partially covered in plants (maybe those were the hanging gardens!) but there was no access to the top of the pillars, only to a suspended foot bridge at the middle of the pillar. I admit that I didn't go there. There are some gardens on the ground, but nothing impressive. From design point of view the pillars are spectacular as they simulate giant trees and are lit during the night. However in a garden I was expecting to see nature and plants. If you're looking for the same thing, go to the botanic garden which is wonderful!"
"We visited there the weekend it opened but the line was over 2 hours long for tickets, so we left. We returned a few days later, thinking it would be less crowded on a week day. We were wrong. The line to buy tickets took over an hour and 30 minutes. When we approached the counter with our credit card, the girl working there did not know how the credit card machine worked. Really! She had to call someone else over to explain how to charge a credit card.Then her machine broke and we ended up paying cash.The path leading up to the ticketing line is all outdoors under a hot baking sun. You could melt just from the walk up to get your tickets. There is no shade provided at all. If you are looking for some air conditioning to get out of the sun, you can go to the Marina Bay Mall,, which is cold and free and a few minutes walk from there. We paid $56 for 2 people, and it was hardly worth it. This place may be good for people who have never traveled and have never seen unique flowers and trees. But one garden in the flower dome looked just like my garden back in upstate NY and so it was a bit disappointing for me. And given that the Botanical Gardens is free and the Orchid Garden is only $S5, i would suggest going there for a much more enjoyable and worthwhile time to be with nature."
The place looked out of place as it is all artificial. It is a waste of time as there is no real warmth and vibe to the place.
I guess it's great to do with kids or something but it's not really anything interesting for adults.
If you like quality gardens pop by Raffles and enjoy an authentic Singapore sling amidst lush palms and gorgeous gardens. I'd take Raffles over gardens by the bay any day!
"Terribly run place. No explanation for anything. Spent 1 hr standing in line to get to the front of the line, only for them to tell us we need to go to the ticketing booth for time slot. We had tickets in our hands, why the hell would we consider going to the ticketing booth for anything??? So we went to the ticketing booth, got a time slot that is about 1 hr later, than stand in line again for another hour and 15 minutes give or take to get up to the skyway.We got to watch BOTH of the light show from the line! Despite the fact our time slot is for 8:20. But they are so unorganized that by 8:45, when the last light show started, they still have 8pm time a lot people waiting in line. I am DEAD SERIOUS!Wasted time aside, even while watching the 1st light show we thought the light show was underwhelming. The 2nd show wasn't any better.Wasted 2.5 hrs we won't get back. That's my thoughts on this place. Would not recommend."
We went to the gardens in early December and tried to purchase tickets to walk in the upper areas however we were informed that due to threat of lightning it was closed and if it was to reopen we would have to purchase an extra ticket at 28sd for the Christmas experience....this wasn't advertised on their website.
"We were in Singapore for two days before Christmas, and having read all hype about the Christmas wonderland, we thought it would be a nice thing to take our kids to (ages 5 and 7). We pre-booked tickets for entry, the sky walk and a magic show by Vitaly.We arrived around 5, just in time for the drizzle. Singapore is not exactly rain-shy, so to be told that the OCBC sky walk was shut because of the rain was disappointing to say the least. In theory, we could have exchanged our tickets for another day, but as we were leaving the next morning, this wasn't an option for us.It turns out that Christmas wonderland is about as exciting as the inside of a paper bag in the daylight, and even less so in the rain. Great! So we headed over to the flower dome, but the queue was so ridiculous that we didn't have time to visit before the magic/illusion show was scheduled to begin.At this point, the rain was beginning to pick up. We headed back towards the theatre, at the other end of the park. As the rain became torrential, the covered walkway ended, and we had to run through puddles and rain to get to the theatre - again, rain is not uncommon in Singapore, and at other times, the sun is incredibly strong, so why not design a sheltered walkway??We bought tokens to use the miniature train, which you can take over to the theatre, but it was soooooo slow, only one of the two trains was running and it only takes 8 people in the rain. It seemed to take around 30minutes to make a round trip, so even with a short queue, it quickly became apparent that this wasn't an option.Anyway, we braved the rain and arrived at the theatre, and grabbed some seats. We watched Vitaly's promo video, which showed us his signature trick of producing a rose from what had started as a blank piece of paper. A nice trick, but why, when he came on stage, did we then get to see it twice more in his 30minute set? Even the kids were pretty underwhelmed.After the show, the rain had stopped. Having bought the non-refundable fairground tokens for the train, the kids then went on a couple of rides. They were very tame, and eye-wateringly expensive - $8 per child for a three minute go on the swings.Still soggy, we ultimately decided to skip the light show as we had heard the taxi queues afterwards can be horrendous and the kids were beginning to get hungry, so we headed back into Singapore. There is a food court at the gardens, but this was also rammed with long queues, and nowhere to sit.All in all a huge, expensive disappointment."
The minute we entered we asked the information counter about hiring the buggy or if shuttle services were available. There information desk clearly declined nothing as such is available and we have to walk all the way. In the end when we were visiting the cloud dome we saw the shuttles operatoring and the buggy rides also on rent. Highly disappointed because of this.Other wise the Gardens are beautiful to visit.
The decoration this year is very bad compared to last year.. And the snow is little.. Everyone was expecting it to be everywhere around the Luminarie light sculpture. So Dissapointed. Other then xmas carol.. Bring up some good performance like example dance.. Come on singaporean can do better. Such a let down
"Meal was dreadful. Certainly not vfm. Eat somewhere else. Chicken was plastic ally in both taste and texture. Oh dear, dear dear dear........"
Waiting time was more then 1 hour for conservative dome. It was really regretting to visit Gardens by the Bay
"It's a pretty basic greenhouse walking tour with tree and plant, and christmas lighting and decoration, at a scale that's smaller than the indoor portion of most botanical gardens in the US, and Macy's alone has more Christmas lights and decoration than this. In fact, there are many houses that have more lights and decorations than this place. Our group basically started comparing which of our hometown streets have better decorations.The Skywalk has a nice view, which is really the only photo-worthy part of the entire place. For something this small, they charge separate tickets to see each one, which irks me even more. For those who have traveled to other countries and seen bigger, you will be sorely disappointed."
totally dissappointing. no indication of where the entrance starts. not driving friendly routes. after we parked the car no indication on where we should proceed to the main gallery. the place is nice but $32 is totally high priced. please be more realistic in pricing. its just christmas songs and the shows were absurd.
"The price is too steep for these conservatories. The flower dome has barely any flowers and nothing that a free flower park can't give you the satisfaction of. The cloud forest is cool but on its own, not worth to pay the money. Also during my visit, i bought the pack together with the ocbc skyway. They have an event and it was either pay 20 dollars more or nothing. Their answers were that I should have known to come before 3pm or come the next day. I am leaving tomorrow and certainly don't have a time machine to turn back time. The attitude of the people sucks and i surely won't recommend this place to anyone. Disappointed, upset, tired. NEVER AGAIN"
We were excited to visit and decided on early evening to visit to see the gardens being lit up. It was so crowded. We went on the Skywalk which was very good. Lots of lovely photo opportunities. It all looks wonderful in the evening but it's more of a tourist attraction rather than a garden. If you want to see a proper garden The Botanical Gardens are utterly fantastic!I wouldn't visit again but nor would I discourage others. This review is strongly my opinion.
"Following friends recommendations and general tourism blogs recommendationsI decided to go to the gardens by the bay.I must say that I had my doubt about the price but nevertheless I decided to go for it with an open mind.It was just a waste of time and money! There is nothing special about the attraction. It over price and similar plantation can be found in other gardens around the world.Also, it is hard not to be cynical about the pro-environmentalist video they show at the exit from the cloud forest.The environmental costs of such a project (garden by the bay) are probably very high."
If you like being squashed in a huge crowd then please do not hesitate to come here for a visit. The whole experience is spoilt by this really which is a shame. The Botanical garden is by comparison much nicer and more importantly is free
"Awful experience! Too many people. Crowds and queues were hectic. I would have paid to get out of there fast! We went after lunch, very hot. Probably better to go at night when not as hot. Avoid peak hours if you can. Go to a real rainforest!"
"We were picked up from our hotel at 8.15am by the transfer bus, so we hadn't had time to get breakfast. I rang to enquire if we could get the tickets and go later (with Buffalo Tours) but they said no. I asked if there were breakfast options at Gardens By The Bay - he said ""You'll never go hungry in Singapore.""However - we did! There were about 10 listed dining options in the brochure. We spent an hour to an hour and a half trying to located each and every one of these ""dining options"" with very unsuccessful results. Every single place at 9.30/10am was closed, all except McDonald's (which I've never been to in my life and won't start now!) and a cafe next door to it which looks like it belongs in a third world country!So we left to go and have breakfast elsewhere and never saw Gardens By The Bay, except while looking for the food options.All the staff were EXTREMELY unhelpful and gave us incorrect information and directions. We were constantly told to go different way to exit - one person said to go upstairs, which we did, but the man upstairs told us to go downstairs.It was a really frustrating and horrible experience, so we did not bother to go back during the day to use our pre-bought wasted tickets."
"no clear signboard at mrt point to floral fantasy, we went to flower dome & need take the $3 shuttle train back to mrt again"
This is ok for people who has never seen trees and waterfalls. Lot of hard work by the constructors and maintainece staff. Themes are addressed well.
Don't waste your time or money. A bunch of plants trees and bushes with hundreds of Asians taking phone pics EVERYWHERE. Lots of kids running around. $28 pp for a short Tramride after waiting in a line. Most plants aren't identified; one set up for pics is non-life size plastic truck filled with tulips. Of course you exit through the elaborate gift shop on your way out. The Tram does NOT drive you through the 'electric' lighted metal 'trees'. You can walk through that too. All 250 acres of it in 90 deg humid heat. Have fun!
"Frighteningly distasteful display of full-blown political misinfmation. I told my family to 'look away' lest they be turned to stone. Please. Let us enjoy the biological diversity without the brainwashing. Thank you, very much!"
"don't go unless you are over 70 years of age. waterfall was the highlight. everything else didn't make sence, fake this and fake that....educational rooms. huh?"
"Went to the Flower Dome this afternoon with my daughters and 4-month old grandson. At one point of our tour, grandson needed to be fed and we found a quiet spot in corner bench. My daughter had on her breastfeeding apron and baby was nicely tucked under it. A young service ambassador named Hani curtly told my daughter that she has to go to the toilet to breastfeed as other visitors may find it offensive. We were appalled by her words as at no time did anyone around us paid us any attention nor gave us any nasty look/remark. When I asked Hani if anyone had made any comments, she said she was just following the rules!! Well, if my daughter had been topless whilst breastfeeding, perhaps I can accept that rule. But she was definitely very covered up compared to some other scantily clad visitors walking right next to head-scarved women in the park. I don't see the service ambassador asking them to cover up!! What kind of message is Gardens by the Bay telling the public about your establishment? According to the Singapore Police Force, breastfeeding in public in Singapore is NOT an offence. I respect the laws of the country and I hope Gardens By the Bay had respected the intention of my Daughter to breastfeed my grandson in public whilst appropriately covered up.I would like to hear from the management what they have to say about this and an apology is in order, I would think.Our visit has been marred by this unpleasant encounter."
The only event that is worth to visit is the tulips flower show. The rest of the flower shows have poor quality and very limited collection of flower.
According to me visiting this place is waste of Money and Time. its highly overrated. Visit only if you have extra time in your schedule.
Nothing interesting at all. Expensive to enter. And all things inside is very expensive. Including food and drinks. Dont bother even if you have spare time.
"Had booked online christmas tickets because no other offer, i can understand. Had to print coupon @the hotel to use as ticket as written : ok. Had to go through nearly all the park to redeem entrance tickets and go through 3 different desks : not acceptable ! And to pay for another extra ticket to get to the skywalk where you are arrassed every 5 minutes max to move on toward the exit : bad joke for christmas day !!! Make all included tickets like Universal or Disney and improve guest relations of the really young staff !!! Won't see me again and will tell others about our huge deception."
"the service staff return the ticket so close to my mum's chest, his hands nearly touch her chest. staff while taking photo for us then asks if we know the background flower was fake. felt like he is laughing at us for taking a pic with a fake flower."
This is a bloody fraud... Seriously overrated. I believe people only above 60 years of age or botanists would enjoy this place. This is one of the most boring places in Singapore and not really worth the effort and time.This place is extremely crowded and claustrophobic. We got really bored over there and please don't take small children with you...its uncomfortable with them
"I plan to visit the garden and wazed it over. Waze led us to Marina East. We stopoed by and asked the security officer (about 9.30pm) on how to get to Gardens by the Bay, he told us to park at the East Bay Parking and walked over. They claimed that it is just a short walk. We do as what they suggested, but ended up walking for 1.5 hours to get there, arriving about 11pm with no one around (no food stalls too). We ended up needed to grab a Grab to travel back to where we drop our car. Even the Grab driver also got surprised with what we gone through, he too enlight us with a possibility that we were pranked as they see that we are driving a Malaysia car.This is certainly improper for a frontliner to provide misleading information to the customers/visitors."
What used to be a pleasant attraction has become a mass tourism disaster to avoid at all cost if you do not want to face over crowded place
After reading the reviews I was super excited to go here. I was overwhelmingly disappointed. And that's something coming from some one who loves the garden. The only thing worth seeing was the light show. Unfortunately we could not do the sky walk due to the weather. I would never waste my time going back
"I attended the light and music show tonight after having attended in March last year and loving it.Tonight was woeful.The music was ghastly ( it had Dean Martin or Frank Sinatra singing Moon River I think ) and the lights were slow and boring to accompany it.I got there 75 mind esy intending to watch both shows.It wasn't just me disappointed compared to last years 'Garden Waltzs' music and fantastic lights.The people next to me who had been there before me walked out after 5 mins as did numerous other people.Another neighbour who's camera battery was nearly flat asked if I would send her the video I was going to take, but then sai don't bother.What is the management thinking !!Sack the music director and go back to the Garden Waltz sound track and lively lights."
"My brother bought tickets for the gardens through Trip Advisor. When we arrived we waisted an hour trying to contact TA as they had failed to send the correct email with bar code to actually access the attraction. They did sort it after the service center contacted them, but caused a bunch is stress and waisted a bunch of precious holiday time . Avoid trip advisor to avoid the stress."
"We took our daughters to the forest cloud, before entering the dome, we saw the queue time was about an hour. While we were queuing, one of my girls wanted to go bathroom, so we asked the staff about the bathroom location, and was told the bathroom was outside the dome. But if we leave the queue then we had to queue from the beginning. We had no choice but forced to leave the queue to take my girl to bathroom. Staff was not friendly enough to let us join back the queue. We had to restart all over again. So we left the place without visiting the forest cloud."
"Overall great experience because the staff there were nice. But please be careful when using the locker as there is no refund and there is also a countdown for you to put the notes in.Worse of all, the machine cost about $4 SGD but if you only have $10 note with you, good luck because the machine doesn't find you change! However you could still go to the visitor's center to change for small notes. I'm a singapore and this locker is a crap"
Visited orchid garden recently at Gardens by the Bay. I know orchids can be a bit boring unless you have beautiful patterns or designs to display the orchids. Singapore flower is the Orchid however Gardens has not managed to bring out the attractive ness of the Orchids. The Tulips and roses theme in previous years were better. Just a feedback so that Gardens can make Singapore more proud in displaying your dear Orchids. Maybe you need to mix Orchids with more roses and lilies and other sweet smelling flowers too. Display was too repetitive with peranakan theme. Good luck for next year Orchid display
"after sunset, there's no special lighting and the whole place look gloomy without the greenery. a waste of money. only go during daylight time."
"Went to the Cloud Forest at Gardens by the Bay at 8am this morning to take pictures but was chased away by some minders who told us the whole area was closed for filming by drone. Judging from the fact the OCBC Skyway doesn't open until 9am but it had people (obviously fake tourists) doing different things, like taking wedding photos and just standing around like cows so they could film them from the drone, I assume it was for their own publicity.Checked the website but there was no mention that this main attraction for the Gardens by the Bay would be closed for filming today. Now that's bad publicity."
The dome may seems impressive in the outside and inside but the amount to pay for the entrance fee does not justify it. Been here once and will not return again.
"I purchased 3 adults tickets online on 24 Apr 2018. To my horror, when I checked my credit card transactions, I was charged twice the amount!"
"I suggest you to never pay for $3 SHUTTLE SERVICEMe and my family went there on 3rd of April 2018. As my dad is an eldery and had some leg pain I purchased 4 tickets of $3 SHUTTLE SERVICE for whole day service. However, I am very unhappy with their rude staffs.Besides the staff treating us so badly.at 8:58 pm when the last light show at super trees finishes. I ran to get the buggy for my dad to take. However the supervisor said we cant wait for your dad even though he is old and his leg pain. Ask us to walk back!!The buggy left at 8:59 pm as the supervisor instruct the driver to dont wait even though he could see my dad walking towards us with difficulty.I am so disappointed and hurt.For those who think they managing this please keep in mind that they need to schedule their buggy during the times that people NEED IT.last buggy at 9 pm doesnt make sense when your stupid super tree show ends at 8:58 pm.Please understand for people who force to take this horrible service it is because they have health issue or they are old in age.Such a stupid management and ground staff."
I went there with my girl to see cherry blossom.wss disappointed as not much to see n most of te flower are going to die. The way to food fair was not clear n I almost being knock by a wheel chair. The lady pushing wheel chair did not want to stop pushing even I'm in front of the wheel chair n in front of me was other people. I met her three times. Finally inside the food fair I lost control n scolded her. Ur securtiy didn't do a gd job on tis. There wasn't any special path for wheelchair to move. What make me frustrate was she almost roll the wheelchair over my girl feet. Imagine if it really happen. I thought this type of event should be well prepare for over crowded but it didn't.
"Very very disappointing. It wasn't like the whole flower dome was filled with sakura as shown in advertisements and photos. It was barely here and there. The entire anime thing inside the flower dome was super unnecessary. We paid for the flower dome to see and take pictures with the flowers, not have unnecessary anime lovers crowd inside. Could barely even take proper photos cos of the anime character people. And honestly, the sakuras were either in its bud, half bloomed, still blooming, dying or dead. So disappointing. Next time gonna read on reviews then visit flower dome. waste of money and time."
"This is a must for a night visit - stunning views and beautiful when lit up, we entered via Marina Bay Hotel which is another mush see"
"Extremely disappointing. One of the domes was closed for a private function, and the other was closed due to maintenance! Not great planning huh?"
Some navigation signboards inside garden are installed in wrong direction. It is misleading. Actually it is installed but didn't rotated correctly. Please see attached Signboard photo and rotate it.
Do not buy a ticket from VIATUR it's a such a scamming. Very disappointed. And there is no cancellation return.
"I visited there just before Christmas. To our surprise, the major attraction the huge flower like structures were closed for some special Christmas festivities and were prices separately. Overly crowded, very hyped. Extremely tiring experience. No easy taxi point for the place. Had to walk all the way to Marina bay casino taxi stand and had to que for 40mins with two Young kids for a taxi. Would never recommend this to anybody."
Its expensive and A waste of money and time a fake place to waste your time nothing much to see and taxi is difficult to get.
Thought would be tacky. I was so far off the mark. Great couple of hours. Only issue is the usual problem of lots of people taking pictures of each other and themselves. Not sure if they appreciated the place or whether they were going to enjoy when they got home and looked at the pictures!
"Just like almost everything else in this city, you leave wondering what exactly you paid for. I wouldn't recommend."
Gardens by The Bay is a MUST SEE experience for everyone young as well as old coming to Singapore. Well planned layout of the two respective Domes which we thoroughly enjoyed spending time.However there was an extra entry ticket of 10 SD per person for seeing' Light & Sound Show' on 21Dec'17 which is normally free. We were told it is due to X MAS decorations. In my view extra decorations were more of a distraction while viewing the Light and Sound Show rather than helping. Extra decoration should have been put up a little distance away as a desperate event/enclosure.
"Tickets were over sold leading to massive over crowding. Hours spent queueing to get into the Domes. For Cloud Forest, there was another queue to get up to the top. Noticed some plants withered due to over crowding. Management should limit the number of tickets sold per day to avoid over crowding."
"I went to Gardens by the Bay on the 24th of December with my 82 year old father to Gradens By the Bay. The number of people going to the domes were incredibly huge. GBTB should have a quota on the no. of people allowed in the domes within a specific time so that family could wait outside and enter the domes within a timing of 1-2hrs per dome. Old people on wheelchairs should definitely be allowed first. I felt so sorry to see the officers there making very old people in wheelchairs join the 300m queue. The Cloud dome had the most horrifying queue ever! I question the safety of all people when they are up there. By the way, i go there quite often with my children and students and i have never seen GBTB so unprepared for so many people (most of them were tourists). I think it is better for tourists to have a safe and beautiful image of Singapore than a bad memory of long queues at the garden."
"Wasted SGD10 per person visiting. The lights looked like leftovers from Deepalvali, the so called snow wonderland are a few weak shots of bubbles hardly passable as snow. No mist fans , poor lighting at night, lame Christmas songs & insufficient crew for crowd control. Don't waste your money or time here if you are travelling to Singapore for Christmas. Lame !"
"We felt we had to go and see this as one of the top tourist sights in singapore but were ultimately underwhelmed. We went at night time when it wasn't crowded with other people and were glad we did, as we wouldn't have wanted to be there with hoards of others during the day.The pictures you see if this place are much better than the place itself. There are things much more worthwhile seeing in Singapore than this, especially if your time is limited!"
"While the Conservatories themselves are worth watching, I think crowd management at Gardens By The Bay leaves a great deal to be desired. Sure, there may be more people on weekends. But this is no excuse for not having enough staff to ensure that visitors know where to start queuing and that others do not cut queue.I also feel that there are not enough signage to guide visitors towards Christmas Wonderland. And quite honestly, the Christmas Wonderland was a big waste of time. Apart from the ""fake snow"" and coordinated light show @ Garden Rhapsody, there isn't really a warm feel of ""Christmas"" at all. Just a bunch of carnival rides and overpriced food stalls that we can find at any fun fair."
Nothing specular and the decoration was plain.So end in end not worth the visit which is what I feel.
"We googled to know it was free...but when we reached-they mandated to buy 8 sgd ticket per person for light and sound show...We were 11 family members, had no choice than to buy it...but of no worthIts was not at All worth of an experience.Not recommended to visit it...even if you have spare time"
My cousin who works in Singapore tour us around at the Garden by the Bay its very nice place and relaxing.
We paid $28 per ticket at DUCK tours and found when we got to Gardens by the Bay that the garden lights were FREE and were told that the Dome was 10 minutes walk away and it closes shortly after the garden lights show is over. I won't be back in Singapore again in the next year so never used our tickets. We have four!! So annoyed!!
"Gardens by the bay feels artificial, roads wide for electric cars, a pointless audio tour is SGD8 which is only worth SGD3-4.Fees to enter a tropical dome is outrages at SGD28.It also costs extra money to visit the super trees.You easily end up at almost SGD 100 per person to visit trees and plants.Is this normal?We did not enjoy Gardens By The Bay which is purely a cash cow and commercial. The media pushed up our expectations which could not be met at all.The original Botanic Garden with the National Orchid Garden is much better and complimentary. Gardens there are more than 150 years old and roads are much more narrow yet offer enough space for everyone."
Avoid this place. It was a complete waste of time - quite far from the nature experience we were expecting. Very touristy and commercialized. Most of one exhibit was focused on Christmas decorations. Lots of fake plastic decorations in the cloud forest exhibit. Total waste of time and $28.
"Bad experience , uncivlised tourists push one another to get their through , they cut the que, if we question them , they get into a argumentative mode .. So barbaric !! Not worth visiting again .."
"To the management,I went to the Garden by the bay for a walk at Monday ard 8 pm & stop by at the food court for satay.Within few minutes, I got bitten 3 times by some insects. I was admitted to hospital the following day & the Dr inform me that I was bitten by an insect called ' Sandfly '. ( photo attached)I think the management shd spray some insects prevention to the areas for any future incidents happen again.Thx if ur management can maintenance the cleanness for the garden for future use.Sent from my iPhone"
"Other than the expensively priced entrance into the air-conditioned domes, the external area is just like any other park ... It is lucky there is the water body, else nothing special ...As for the expensive entrance fees to the ""nothing special attraction"", I supposed because of the poor design which requires extensive maintenance to operate ... more tax money down the drain ..."
"What an absolute shame! We were so looking forward the visiting the Gardens but it was a huge disappointment due to the catastrophic overcrowding. The place is completely insanely crowded well beyond being safe to the point of us taking 1.5 hours to get to am exit in the evening. Queues everwhere. I imagined a leisurely relaxing walk and it was a shuffling between people exercise. People everywhere taking selfies, blocking walk ways, exhibits, plants, flowers. Crowds do not bring out the best in people and this was a horrible visit. We were there from 4pm to 8.30pm but intending to leave at 7pm. Over 2/3rds of this time was spent queuing. Yes what we saw was pretty but instead of being on holiday, this left my child terrified and in tears, elderly parents beyond exhaustion and everyone panicked. Even the security gards were looking frazzled and anxious doing crowd control. It was beyond ridiculous. We paid for the shuttle, it never came. Never again.May be this is typical on a weekend but to us it was quite shocking."
"They used glass and steel to build a weird shaped areas turned into a European garden. It cost us about S$60 (about 40 euros!!) to get in!! There is no concert, no performance, no free drinks once you get in. It is very warm inside like a trapped greenhouse in Europe in the summer. The plants are nice but very boring. Lacks charm like the Coldstream Ancestral Museum we first went to. We took photos here too but selfie opps are not as good as the Coldstream Ancestral Museum. This place is basically like a Tourist Factory. Nothing special. Very very expensive. We feel ripped off."
"I went inspired by the building of this place. But its just a money making tourist trap with little interaction, except for innumerate people taking selfies of themselves rather than bothering with the flowers or beauty they have tried to create. You even get pushed through the ships st the exit. The only exit.As a environmentally aware person I was devastated by what I saw. It must have a huge carbon footprint. The cost to import the trees, the plants, the buildings the maintenance let alone the energy required would put it all into one big deficit. The plants are suffering without adequate UV light. The environmental messages are so small the selfies just walked straight by with little comprehension. Oh dear."
"In the Cloud Forest, there is only 1 lift that goes from 6th to 7th floor. It is meant for those who really need to use the lift, eg wheelchair and prams. Unfortunately, this lift is always packed with people who are fully capable of taking 1 flight of stairs but are too lazy to do so. I was pushing one of my family member in a wheelchair and my husband was pushing a pram with our son. We were unable to enter the lift. People who are fit and healthy, without any wheelchairs or prams, are jumping the queue and pushed their way into the lift. Some even took the lift from 6th floor to level one and then back up so that they can get to the 7th floor. I waited for 20mins in order to be able to enter the lift. Where are the staff? Gardens by the bay deploy 4 staffs to man the other 4 common lifts for people on get from the first floor to the 6th floor but they have no one to man the lift that brings people from the 6th floor to the 7th floor. Of course, from the 7th floor, how can we visit one floor at a time downwards? Via the same lift that was totally jammed packed of course. Poorly designed for wheelchairs and prams. 20 mins to get from 6th to 7th floor. You can do your maths on how long we took from 7th floor downwards to visit each level's attractions in the Cloud Forest Dome."
Paid $56 Singapore dollars for the two of us plus taxi fare to get there. If you love flowers you may enjoy this. Personally waste of money for us. We were in and out very quickly.
"It is oversold, place is a maze, signage is not clear. No water cooler at many places, very hot.Interesting place to go u got to pay to enter.Over hyped"
"I bought a few tickets which allowed me and senior citizen parents to watch the Flower Dome and Cloud forest. Because they were tired we could not finish both on same day. We went after a few days and I was told the tickets were invalid as they should be used on the same day. This was not listed in the terms and conditions, not atleast on the internet booking page. I think its unfair and I had to make my parents wait and buy tickets again. Very very unfair."
Just lots of plants with nice views of the city. It's sold as this amazing place but it's really uninspired.
"Beautiful garden, awesome LED attractions, good one for educational as well. Easy to get there. Will refresh your day when you come after sunset."
"A brilliant place so well thought out the whole place is amazing !!!The plants,trees, flowers the landscape of the area is incredible.We saw it in the day time but a taxi driver said at night it is lit up and is a sight to behold"
"My family and I went to Gardens By The Bay Flowers dome, Tulipmania and the condition was in horrid condition. It was only less than 2 weeks after Tulipmania was opened on 1st April. Also the varieties were so much fewer than 2016."
I didn't like it at all. Went with high hopes as from a distance the towers are beautiful but that's where it ends. People are packÃ¨d in. I felt like I was in sardine can at times.With all the beautiful trees and plants in Singapore it doesn't measure up. This place would be better in a place like Bahrain or Dubai
"Many people think it is great, but i couldn't understand what really is great about two big buildings of glass with some flowers? As if flowers grow in a fridge! It's just to fill up singapore and keep the Singaporeans happy, if you want to see nature go to another place, highly disappointing (apart from the absurd price)"
"Only visit if you are 1. coming from a city / country without any gardens or forest. 2. super spare time to kill 3. just being curious. 4. if its the only way to progress with your date. Otherwise, not worth it unless you want to go to Pollen..."
"You better buy the ticket in Travel Agent in Change Airport when you arrive in Changi, instead of online directly to Garden Bay The Bay.Online = SGD 28/personTravel Agent = SG24/person, if buy 2 person = SGD 42 (1 person = SGD 21).I buy 17 pcs, through online , still SGD 28/person, early bird, 2 month before.And I feel very STUPID, when I see price in Airport...When complain to Ticketing Office in GTB, the staff says...'yes, that is the price if you book online'.VERY STUPID !-Tantan-"
"I'm currently visiting in Singapore and one of the high lights of my visit is to see the ""famous"" Gardens of the Bay w/c everyone is so hype about.Honestly i am so disappointed,not too impressed at all.The dome looks impressive from the outside but inside I found nothing especial or unique about the flowers or arrangement made.Some of the flowers are dying and dull looking ,these flowers are just ref and I plant them in my own backyard.The cloud forest is just ok nothing much to see except for the waterfalls.Again there is no uniqueness to the themes.I'd seen better than this place.Dont get me wrong I'm a big nature girl.The skywalk and the nature walk in the cloud forest are basically the same ,the only difference is one it's in the outside and the other is inside but the experience is the same:(.Another thing ,I think it's expensive for both dome ,I don't think it's worth the money I paid d for .The only positive thing I can say was,their customer service and staff are great and helpful.The builder of the facility could had done better."
"Very disappointed as they just put the plant together, this is not valuable in both biological and cultural aspect. The plant and the architecture is not harmonic. The woodcraft is great, so art piece is good too, but overall is vulgar. You may consider it as a photo taking zone.You can go there to walk around, but don't buy the ticket, not worth, no harm to skip it."
"Told that GARDENS BY THE BAY IS BEST SEEN AT NIGHT of the 5 tourist brochures I collected at Changi airport, my hotel & train stations that had an informational section highlighting GARDENS BY THE BAY only 1 was totally dedicated to & appeared to be the official Gardens by the Bay marketing tool.NOT ONE mention that ticketing to the 3 main attractions closes at 8:00pm.We boarded 3 trains just to get to the destination. The park looked so vast that we purchased shuttle tickets at 8:02. When the shuttle delivered us to the attractions we went straight to the ticketing booth only to see from outside in pitch blackness the interior of the booth full of people winding down operations. It was shut. No exceptions.Nobody mentioned this-neither the shuttle bus ticket seller or driver let alone my 5 brochures.Saw the rest of what was to be seen from the shuttle.After politely highlighting this oversight to the shuttle bus ticket collector & showing him my 5 brochures, he searched for a dedicated brochure located at the sight which says in minuscule type that ticketing closes at 8pm.Returned home bitterly disappointed."
"This should be first time we give a One STAR for a Singapore Attraction.Not fully about Gardens by the Bay, but the company BLUE SKY EVENTS who organise the poor show of Christmas Wonderland.We had early purchase about 10 tickets (without any discount) for 24 Dec.Since family members want to visit early, so purchase addition 4 for 20 Dec, but realise this time got VISA discount , however there was no ICON seen, but we do the payment with VISA card and write in to see can refund the discount ( About $9 for this 4 tickets)Quite lousy reply from the Blue Sky Events Company, no name was mention, and keen on replying no no no ..... and did not see the points about their system error and the way to improve the purchase sequence.Upset by the reply, we even give out the 10 ticket (cost about $80) and spent better time at Sentosa USS.it was the type of poor customer service and response that really upset people during this holiday season.Garden by the Bay who see this review better think carefuly which company to choose to organize christmas wonderland 2017!!!As whoever company organise the events at Garden by the Bay will affect the professional image of this unique gardens in the world.Many in social media had been comparing 2015 did not charge any entrance fees, but 2016 need to pay ( reason to have smooth human traffic).let said you're got 1m visitors during this period, each pay about $8, you're earn addition $8million Dollar, we just hope the money is not the main intention for you're to charge people to enjoy christmas at Garden by the Bay??as it was suppose to be free for all during holiday season , kindly review it again, before getting more negative comment from public, also choose wisely which event company you're want to have to organise such important events. Thank."
"Christmas lightings are not as spectacular as expected despite being charged the entrance fee for the 1st time. Many people were seen hanging around at the entrance, oblivious that they have to get tickets online."
"Crowded, unnatural, expensive, not so great facilities, lousy loud music ... what more can I say? Much better to go to the Botanic Gardens."
Is beautiful place but too expensive. Since that is ticket payment. Children games should not so expensive or give free. I won't bring family go any more.
We went here as part of our night tour. It was awful. Lights were substandard and music terrible. My husband didn't even realise show had started. Only had time for the light show then had to move on. If I go to S Singapore again I would go in the day time and stay a lot longer to explore.
"This was not a great experience for me and my husband. We had the stroller where our son was taking a nap. The place was too crowded. At the entrance one elderly Singaporean lady was in front of the stroller as there was so much crowd. The stroller ""touched"" her slightly and at the exact time I apologized to her. She was beyond rude. She was frowning at me and scolding me in some language I didn't know. She had a couple of friends with her and she was going on and on despite me being apologetic. This took about 10 minutes. This ruined our afternoon. Flowers were beautiful. Loved the fragrance. But had a very bad experience with the elderly singaporean."
"We spent an afternoon and early evening here. The external gardens are amazing and free. We did visit one of the dome's which we had to pay for but worth the money. There is a tree top walk which gives tremendous views over the gardens. Also a tree top bar/restaurant in another tree. Both the latter are not free, although you get a free drink (non alcoholic) with your admission ticket to the bar. The night light show - again free - within the gardens is really fantastic. We took a boat trip from our hotel to the gardens which gives a running commentary of landmarks and buildings."
Very nice designated place..Surrounding are serene and beautifulThe lights are beautiful in the night.Have enjoy our time here..
"I went as my husband wanted to go and to be honest I was bored. We visited the flower and cloud domes, full of orchards and trees !! Very unimpressed but ok if you like this type of thing."
"Was expecting much more from this place as this is one of Singapore's main attractions, was quite boring. This place is only great for those who love looking a different plants and trees. Not much to see. Wasn't worth the admission fee."
"What can i say? If this venue is one of the top attractions in Singapore then ""Houston we have a problem"". This place was tacky, lifeless, kitsch and abject. Its reasonably easy to get to using the underground. Its set up effectively as three different worlds, with two set up as domes, were humans can marvel at flowers, plants and loads of other green stuff which is, for the most part, not even the real thing and just a man-made copy. There was also a tree walk along fake man made trees as well as a fake indoor waterfall which just looked tacky and out of place. We paid a lot of money for this and it felt like daylight robbery. One only needs to look at the Eden Project in Cornwall to see how it should have been done. What a disappointment."
"Queue at the entrance went all the way to the outside of the park, awful, just when I bought tickets I had to queue behind almost a thousand people in the Sun. There was no apology, moreover I had to deal with people cutting lines, being extremely impolite. Its not worth your money to spend most of the time queueing. Not coming again."
"i didn't find a single reason to visit this place in a mesmerizing city called Singapore.If you been told that you habe to travel good 7000kms all d way to see flowers, then you will find better to visit rose garden in Chandigarh . Children and elders may feel somewhat soothing in that place.My sincere advise is don't waste your time and visit Riverside which is never included in any tour packages."
"It's like one of those thing, either you love it or you will hate it. The flower dome is big but I walked out cause the smell was overpowering! It's like walking in bed bath and beyond for about 35 mins, I personally don't enjoy flowery smells, to me it simply stinks. The second dome is a forest dome, let's say they have made a tiny hill and it's all green.Would i go back? Nope! Unless I'm having a romantic walk there at night (free) with my husband..."
"No providing you enough information, different staff give you different views for same thing. Terrible customer service and beware they can spoil your visit"
"Nothing to see. All nature are artificial. If you are Indonesian wth a lot of nature beauty, visit this place will show you nothing."
"Why pay to see the plants when you could easily see them in any park, backyard or garden. I have been to this garden when it first opened few years back on my previous visit. it was free admission back then. However, my recent visit shocked me when all the admission is now transformed into admission fee required in prior."
As per the receipt that is wat I ve order in earlier on. One hr plus waiting time which I can wait but I just find it not amazed at all. Maybe not the restaurant fault maybe it's the call centre fault. Ask for rice but unable to provide one. Pay for 477 inclusive of service fee and received no fork n spoon for my dinner. Plis look Into it.
"It's too hot to walk around, it's not meant for cyclists or runners, and even worse, the two enclosed ""conservatories"" are quite unimpressive and even laughable. The flower dome comprises a random collection of trees and plants (and not that many flowers) that served NO educational purposes and wasn't even entertaining. I walked through it in half and hour and was left perplexed. Are we back in the Victorian age where authorities assembled random specimens for display? What was the point of this? I have no idea. The other conservatory ""the cloud forest"" was even worse. Centered around a fake waterfall, it comprises random plants and epiphytes and astoundingly has a fake ""cave"" with fake stalagmites and amethyst geodes like a bad new age store. I just laughed and walked out."
This a zoo for plants!To visit the two domes it costs AUD$28 per adult. Otherwise it is free to just stroll around. Inside it is absolutely freezing. Even though its humid and hot outside its absolutely freezing. Take a thick jumper (preferably a hooded jumper). The plants look miserable. If you know a bit about plants like I do you'll feel terrible looking at them!
I had wanted to rent a buggy and they would only book for a group of 12 or more and we had elderly pax travelling and nil alternate options provided for us. We decided not to go to this venue
"Sorry but however sustained or whatever it claimsSgd$28 for an entrance is overpricedSaying ur shuttle is unlimited and u had to pay $3 for is it dumb ! I don't think a tourist would be able toWalk that far and spent that time to get it frree!!! ( freeUnlimited shuttle for sgd$3?!?Funny .With .....Entrance is $28FYI it's not unlimited shuttle because IT HAS ROUNDTRIP TOTAL OF 2Drops offs!!!Outside entrance to garden entrance (lol)I'm a plant / garden lover......this place....nothing special ! Except for the architecture if place. Nothing elseAll plants there..... I can buy for cheap, nothing special !$28 for adults btw!!"
"Allow 2 days for this depending on weather and walking fitness. First day we did the two domes because it was raining. By 3pm it was rained out and audio tour shut early and Skywalk was wet.So we venture back next day but the audio trolley tour closes at 5.30pm so couldn't do that. With sunset after 7pm and light show not until 7.45pm, 5.30pm finish is way too early. Very disappointing!!! Did the skywalk and waited for the Light Show. Fantastic."
"Nice building from out said , but nothing important from inside , things available in many places , especially for travellers"
"We went to the garden by the bay, it's a stunningly beautiful place and is even better at night. The service however was so bad, we went to the visitors centre to find out about the conservatories, Sky walk and shuttle. The person who was manning the counter was busy in a conversation on him phone, he look up once during the 10 minutes he spoke to us. He response were not helpful at all, we were traveling with friend who injured him back and we were trying to get around with the lease amount of walking and this guy was only interested in the conversation with the person on his phone.He became rude and spoke to us like we were stupid.To the gardens by the bay, please screen the people you put into these customer facing jobs"
"We arrived there in a December evening, and I don't know if it was because of the date, but it was one of the most crowded places I've been to, and everyone (mostly Chinese) were pushing and pushing, even our baby's stroller. The main entrance was blocked, so we had to take some special elevators, and took more than 1 hour. After that, we had to walk more than 30 minutes to the nearest bathroom, and the staff was really not helpful to find them. The lighted trees were not so impressive. Then we went to the taxi area and, again, a big, big mess, a lot of people skipping the line, NOT EVEN ONE PERSON to guide or control, and we had to wait more than 1:30 hr to get a taxi!!. The most exhausting and disappointing experience ever. Won't be back ever again to this place. Plus, the city in general is very nice, but Singaporeans are so cold, with their upset face and attitude all the time."
we visited this as it is #1 on tripadvisor however were really disappointed.would only recommend if you like plants.otherwise wouldnt advise going.
Don't pay for the tickets! There is no need to buy tickets to get into their landmark! The tickets are to visit the flowers and trees!
Come in and don't bother getting out. Toilets? Two cubicles per toilet and dirty as. Taxi queue? Two hour wait. Never coming back again.
"Let's begin by saying that I love Gardens By The Bay. I have been several times and last year we also went to the Christmas market which we absolutely adored. It's simply astonishing! So we decided to go again this year. That was a big mistake. We couldn't even make it to the entrance. We tried to make our way through the people queuing but people came back after having queued for two hours just to get to the MRT from the market itself. Everyone was returning and saying you cannot get through, people are getting squashed so please go back. We didn't believe this and waited some more and tried to advance. When we decided it would indeed not work after another half hour (we had gained less than 1 meter) we returned home very disappointed. Again, we love GBTB and have been there several times and will go again too. The daily lightshows are a must see for every tourist and we take everyone that comes to visit us here. But the Christmas market on weekends in December... forget about that one. Probably best to go very early in December when the crowds are most likely still manageable."
This was just too much like Disney land for us. I would suggest seeing the real cloud forests of Central America instead. We liked the National Orchad Gardens better.
"Some Fake plants with overly-made landscape, it's not a natural garden, it's a Sci-Fi Plant theme park while they emphasize eco-friendly thingy but they tried so hard to decorate all these metal or concrete or plastic plants with tons of power-hungry lightings? Ironic.Not worth the monie if you are a true nature lover!"
"I have seen breathtaking places, this is nothing about it. A very big and unnatural garden. That is all. It is not worth to see."
"If you have nothing better to do which is I was after a tiring day in office (on a short trip to SGP), I saw this place.. The good past is that its huge, clean and provides you place to jog.. so its like a running park around the main attraction but the artificial jungle sucked big time.. there were hardly any unique species.. Pitcher plant area was closed. The rock was dimly lit.. Most portions weren't even visible and even if they were.. I would rather ask anyone to go visit jungles in Indonesia.. Not a tourist destination but a decent hangout for locals. Btw, I thought I would love such a place because I usually do"
"We heard a lot about it ,so much comment on trip advisor,so we add it to must do list in Singapore,we where very disappointed,we just waisted a day ,it is very confusing to walk about sort of similar to ikea store ,one way in one way out with confusion in between and lots of tourists taking photos to navigate."
We went there during the day and the heat & humidity took all the fun out. I didnt find the park charge of S$ 28 good enough to explore the park.
"There s nothing much seriously... besides light, man-made plantations.. i suggest we could go indonesia for tropical paridise forest"
"Crappy car park system. Once gantry is spoilt, you will get stuck for at least in the car park because their people refused to let the barrier go up until you pay them manually.They want your money so badly they rather tarnish their reputation.It's crazy. Truly uniquely Singapore.Avoid at all cost. You have been warned."
There were nothing interesting to see or enjoy.Can't understand what people find so interesting in this place.
We did not find anything great about this place. It is hyped. The OCBC skywalk is the only thing that is a bit interesting. Entry to the conservatories is very expensive. Give it a visit only if you have too much spare time.
Very boring place to visit.But If you are with a child then he or she will enjoy as there is a children's park.
"I and my friend had a pair of tickets to flower dome and and one pair of tickets to cloud dome. Initially, we thought both pair of tickets could be used on different days before the expiry date on the ticket. Hence, we have decided to go there on twice occasion. On the 2nd occasion, we were refused entry to flower dome. After checking with the staff, we were told the two pair of tickets has to be used on the same day and should not be used on the same day.When we asked where was this clause stated? The staff stated it was stated behind the tickets. After looking at the ticket, it was an extremely small print stated. Who will really notice such a small print? Furthermore, we made the 2nd trip (quite tiring to travel by walking and refused entry). The staff was not flexible to exercise judgement call to let us go in as an exception case. We were very disappointed with this place!!!"
Maybe it was just me but this seemed to be a bit of a waste of time completely... There is literally not much else to do rather than eat at the limited selection of restaurants around here and look at some plastic/metal structures that are in actual fact quite ugly. Recommend skipping this if you are in Singapore for a short time..
"Nothing more than just a few exotic potted plants and a free park to subsidise MBS hotel at the taxpayers' expense.Even if you are a avid greenie, there are many private gardens in Singapore and abroad which feature a lot more soul, blood and sweat in the horticulture and landscaping.Nothing more than just a white elephant commissioned to showcase the grandiose ego of the party that is gripping the country's finances and future. Thank to MBT, the billion of dollars just to maintain the place annually will be broken on the backs of the local labour force."
"a few trees and grass in an overwhelmingly steel and cement world...not a garden of the kind which soothes one or relaxes, overbuilt"
"We let us talk into visiting this at the airport so we spent the 25SGD each on the ticket. I have to admit that we went there later in the evening so it was dark already. When we arrived the guy at the entrance said we should not go in as one hour is too few for it. Looking back I was done after 15 minutes...This really only makes sense if you never visited a real forest or nature in general, which means if you are a pure city kid. Anyone else will get bored within minutes.So in short for us it was a complete waste of time and money."
"I do like a real garden , this one lights up like a Christmas tree . Perhaps it's great in a city full of concrete , but I don't get why a green initiative would be lit up all night and conserve so much power and waste electricity"
"I can't understand about the people who write excellent, great etc !! , I was fuel by the people who review this location , after visiting this place, it is nothing but artificial park, expensive with no services and the worst restaurants you could thing ofWe walk everywhere to see something special about the place , I prefer natural park than this non since placePC. It is very expensive if you are not Singaporean citizenif you have to go ,,Don't expect to stay more than one hours"
"I was mislead by the reviewers, who wrote something not real about the park, so I took my kids to this park , and it was disappointing, maybe it will be good for Singaporean student to learn about trees etc, for tourist, it was a west of time , also the discriminate in prices, for tourist is very expansive while Singaporean pay a cheap price"
"It is Ok , but really not worth driving all the way there, and it suffer from lack of services, very expensive, I do agree with other reviewers that the entree fees is expensive unless you are a Singaporean citizen it will be a cheaper price"
"nice place, Nothing special about this place , it is all about plants from different part of the world , not bad to see, as it all about landscaping , nothing special, it will take you about 20 to 30 minute to see itBe careful they entry price for tourists is double the price , I really did not like this in a modern city"
I came for a visit garden was beautiful but the is one thing it is reduculess Im driving n I don't even leave my car I was just waiting to pick someone and the security keep asking me to leave the premises n ask me to make a uturn..reduculess security..will never be back..
"We did not liked this place, it was boring, time wasting, the show at night was waste of time, we saw many families leaving much before the end of this show and within few min we also left without waiting it to finish.much better places to see in Singapore, this was time wasting and very boring."
"Gardens by the Bay in Singapore was a disappointment. Everything in the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome was very artificial - definitely not worthy of the S$28 per person admission fee. We went at 7:00 pm, and the lighting inside the domes was very dim making it very difficult to take photos."
I thought this place was a real waste of time. All artificial/plastic and out of context. Hardly any flowers in the gardens and little of genuine interest. Too man-made fabricated for me.
"First it is a fitness test and a map-reading challenge to wend your way through the Sands Hotel and the Gardens by the Bay to get to the Flower Dome and the Cloud Forest. It is very picturesque through the Gardens. Upon reaching the domes, we were confronted by a $US26 entrance fee. That sounded over the top so we chose to go to one only at a reduced rate. Once inside the Flower Dome. we wished we had not bothered with it either. We love flowers but do not fancy ourselves as horticulturists. We had had enough in 15 minutes. Several others shared our view upon exit. Anyone who has seen the Eden Project in Cornwall would laugh at this exhibit. Our recommendation is to go on the Singapore Flyer (not at all scary) and take a few pictures of the architecture."
"An artificial environment. No sense of nature. No interaction with flowers. One had to be on the lookout for carts taking paying tourists on a trip through the park. Artifical is the right word. This attraction should be avoided at all costs. If you happen to be staying at an ajoining hotel then go over, otherwise find something better to do with your time."
"I had been to the gardens by the Bay on the last day of my trip... Firstly, I am not a person who loves or likes plants and stuff... They charged me about 58 SGD for the 2 observatories which were completely waste for me.. Had different plants from different countries in one observatory and in other had a huge artificial waterfall which was nothing great either... The place looks stunning from outside but didnt find it great from within.."
"This place is a sad reflection on modern day Singapore, where everything, including nature, can be packaged into a glass container and sold off at an extortionate price to well heeled tourists who are too fat and lazy to get themselves into a real national park or garden. It's all contrived and plastic - boring in the extreme, as any interesting insects or non-approved plant growth is removed by an army of underpaid foreign workers constantly throughout the day. The Singapore Botanic Gardens are a far more interesting place to visit.This place is also ""packaged"" as a place of sustainability - highly questionable given the huge input of concrete and air conditioning that constantly takes place here. Maybe it is sustainable when compared to a 16 lane freeway or Marina Sands shopping centre, but there is no way it is sustainable when compared to a real park or garden."
"Plastic fantastic! I am not a great admirer of over-engineered disney-land-like tourist attractions and this is definitely such a one! Don't bother to visit the completely ridiculously overpriced halls - if you want to see something more real, just go to MacRitchie or Bukit Timah nature parks...!!!A stroll in the park to see the statues is ok - if you can stand the crowds...The food court is ok.And if you want to see lite flying, just go to the most southwestern corner of the park - that s perhaps the most sympathetic part of it all..."
Amongst Singapore's parks this is by far the worstSave your time and effort please go to the botanical garden instead at orchard
"This is a concrete and glass monstrosity. It is so hot because there is concrete everywhere. The waterfall is interesting, but generally this isnt a great place."
what a spectacular waste of money to build this. Why would anyone pay good money and spend their time visiting man-made concrete buildings covered with plants with little or poorly written educational information? what is the point of this whole construction? or the dome next door of potted plants with no signs? avoid this place. you will be better off at the free Botanic gardens or just visiting your local nursery where at least you will know what plants you are looking at.
This place is too hyped-up. If you don't know what to do with your time it is worth a visit. It is a notch better than a meaningless afternoon in the shopping mall. Otherwise if you are a real botanist you will be better off to the Botanical Gardens.This place produces so much air-con and consumes so much energy that it is amazing that it is touted as an environmental attraction.The attraction is very artificial and fake. The price is exorbitant and a free walk in the gardens outside may be more pleasant.The best thing here is that parking space is still plentiful.
"I fought the feeling for 10 minutes after getting in, but then I gave in and WhatsApped a friend:- 'Gardens' by the Bay must be the single most fake hideous repulsive exponent of cluelessness I've ever seen in my life. -Who is this for? What is the purpose? What were they thinking? What should we be thinking? And where are the 'Gardens'? The concrete tracks with patches of plants here and there to hide the view of public elevators and toilets, leading to the central monstrosities of steel & concrete ugly columns; you call that 'gardens'? What are those things? Images from which nightmare should these monsters resemble?One of the monsters seems to house a IndoChine restaurant. Not that Singapore had a shortage of IndoChine chain restaurants, but how is it linked to a 'Garden' or a 'Bay' for that matter? IndoChine seems to call this a ""SuperTree"". Like in: superior to a tree? What is ""super"" about this slab of concrete and steel? Other than that it is super fake and super ugly? What's wrong with a REAL tree? Then again, if you don't mind paying just to get in and then be charged double for food, it's probably a much better eating option than the 'canteen' a bit further down towards the back. That is a sad and noisy lack-of-inspiration eating hall around some fast food outlets where deep-fried fat = food.Again, who is this for and what were they thinking when they started this? What should future generations be thinking? If the extraterrestrials arrive a century from now, how will they judge us seeing this insult of nature?Oh wait, now I know, of course, it's for them and that is the purpose: it's to scare the extraterrestrials away and to make sure no higher intelligence comes talk some sense into mankind."
Gardens By The Bay is just a waste of time and resources. The admission fee is way overpriced to see trees and plants. It's nowhere near as good as Central Park in New York City (and Central Park is free just as it should be). Not worth visiting. It'll bring great disappointment unless if its one of your hobby or passion.
"Did not enjoy the visit to the Gardens by the Bay too much. Notwithstanding that huge amounts of money was spent to create the Gardens, I could not find the Singapore trademark within the Gardens. The footpaths were mostly cast in cement or cement slabs and did not get the feeling of being in a Garden. Conservatoriums were interesting and seemed like a mixed up effort of creating something different. Lack of local identity."
"Probably it would be nicer if I have gone in the evening, but in the afternoon, it is hot and sunny, not to mention the ever humid weather. To make matters worse, there are minimal shelters around.Nothing much to see here. The only good thing about it is the excellent service staff from the welcome center(or is it called info center?)."
"Strongly recommend that you visit the excellent original Botanic Gardens in Singapore, rather than waste your time (and money) at the new Gardens by the Bay.Signage around the new gardens is either appalling or non-existent; cashier staff at the paydesk are abrupt and unfriendly, and the Cloud Dome is a disgraceful waste of an opportunity to have created something special and which could be memorable for the right reasons (rather than just for the concrete and confusion that reigns inside the 'building' - architect's ego allowed to run amok and created an 'experience' with no functionality and a dearth of plants).To be fair, the Flower Dome is nice and well presented, and once the main gardens mature and the signage problem is sorted, then they will be great.But in the meantime ... the existing Botanic Gardens are 10x more rewarding."
"More thought has gone into where the cafes and restaurant chain outlets go than the actual plants. It looks unfinished and the ""Supertrees"" are just metal plant holders - there are nowhere near enough real trees.I don't see how so much concrete can be eco-friendly.This cost close to $1 billion dollars, So why are we still paying to get into the conservatories and the walk on the OCBC Skyway bridge?The cost of getting into the 2 conservatories and to see the ""waterfall"" drain thing is $20 + per person.Don't bother, go to Macritchie Reservoir or the Botanical Gardens instead.I can see concrete anywhere, why would I want to see it in a garden?"
I have been standing in line for 1.5h and it's another 45 mins wait to get an annual pass. The day tickets are not any better. They have only 2 counters to cater for day admission. They finally realised that the wait is too long and set up makeshift ticket counters but did not channel the crowd there. Very poor image of the Management. No online registration either.
"Extremely beautiful and seems to come into a fairyland. Just pity is the park is not big, just half of the circle."
when having waiting time in Changi airport don't miss this fantastic waterfall. We even had time for breakfast in this amasing area.
"Jewel is the best shopping mall for an airport around the world, as people said. It is also the best shopping mall in Singapore in my opinion.Firstly, the world biggest waterfall and the Show has already attracted all the eyeballs. The train that run through the building is awesome, although it's closed now.You can find all kinds of shops there. The restaurant choices are one of the most in the area, with all kinds of cuisine, from cheap to expensive. Cinema, hotel, indoor playground, supermarkets, Changi experience, a lot of parking space, it has all the things you need.The only drawback is the crowd, sometimes the 1000+ parking space will be all full, and hard to find a seat even with so many restaurants. And it's quite far to walk to T2 or T3 for the MRT station."
"We stayed at airport hotel cos we wanted to visit Jewel.It was a good choice to stay a night so no rush to see everything here.We came earlier before hotel's check in at 3pm. We had lunch at shake shack.Then started shopping immediately. There were 5 floors in all plus 2 basements.Shops are concentrated on 1 to 4, 5th is more entertainment, bars and food outlets. Level 4 mostly for kids shopping.B1 B2 food restaurants and some retail shops too.We shop at Desigual, Muji, Footlocker, ShirtBar, Zara, Marks and Spencer, etc.There were some designer shops like Moschino, Furla, Katespade, etc but since we can get these in towns, we look for unique shops. DESIGUAL has limited edition items only at Jewel when items are first launched. By the time items move to the town stores, items could be sold out.The shops are lined up in a circle so just walk and you end up at the starting point again. There are some restaurants or food shops in some of the levels so you can still dine then shop again on same level.We tried JW360 for dinner, Shake Shack for lunch, Paris Baquette for Tea Time and had ice cream at birds of paradise. Now, you see where the calories go?We just stroll floor by floor so easy to complete and not miss any shop.At level 5 we pay to visit the evening christmas garden so we can take some great photos. There is even a camp site on this level where you can rent a tent just for fun. We had already booked a hotel.The best part in Jewel is of course, the atrium with waterfall. At 630pm, there is the train going around the waterfall, snow flakes flying plus smoke effect. Just good photo session. Then 730pm, they have the light and music show. The sound of the water crashing down, colour changing plus music make this, a spectacular event!There is even a SHAW movie theatre so if visitors had a short stopover, they could watch a movie here.We love this place cos there is so much to see and do. Or even if you just want to waste time here, it can also help you to destress.There should be an airport shuttle just to bring people from town to here in a swift. That is, express airport shuttle.Overall, fantastic place to visit cos no tourists and thus not overly crowded.A good escape if time permits."
"Great place to venture, alot of shops, cafe and much more, great for shopping and varieties of food to choose for."
"We were walking around at approx 9.30am at Jewel to find places to eat. As we were searching at the directory, the Jewel staff approached us and informed us that most of the eateries will open approximately at 10.30am. Those that were already open are non-halal options.He gave many suggestions on where to go and what to eat and assured us that we will enjoy our visit here.Thank you for being proactive and going out of the way to speak to us while on his cleaning duty. Please convey my thanks to Mr Abdul (I hope I remember his name correctly)."
Amazing... My kids absolutely loved it here. Such a fun place to go and will definitely go there again.
Had a sparkling time at Jewel! Like the Manual Life sky net walking! Had a thrilling good time. The staff there were also friendly and helpful.
"This is the most beautiful and best functioning airport I have ever been to, and I have been to very many. It is quite impressive as everything works so well. Lost of shops, restaurants and lounges and lots of open spaces. And the design is modern and beautiful. A pleasure to pass through."
Really beautiful airport. The waterfall portion isn't exactly inside the airport but they make it pretty accessible for travelers to visit. If you're only doing a quick layover at the airport and want to see the waterfall you can take the tram that drives by it. We came to the airport early just to check it out. You can even check your bags in there so you can walk around..just make sure you leave enough time to do all of it and get to your gate on time.
"At first bought the bundle ticket in order to do all activities and we thought that it was quite price : but it definitely worths every penny !All activities were very funny and adapted for kids and big kids.Each part is very different from the others so it's not boring and you can spend many hours there. The mall is also full of amazing shops and they are plenty of good restaurants , it's such a good destination for a rainy Singaporean day."
That place is extraordinary.Im so amze with the vortex cant keep my eyes of it.Its very clean and very cool
I'd like to highly commend Carissa Santos from the Jewel Guest Centre who very kindly helped us find our car. Carissa noticed that I was repeating my steps when trying to locate our car in the car park and went out of her way to find me and assist me in finding my car. She was kind enough to spend a good 20 minutes helping us and even ensured we were safely in our car before saying goodbye. She went above and beyond what I expected - thank you Carissa!
"As a Singaporean, I'm proud to live in a country with the best airport in the world. You can spend the whole day at Jewel and you will still not feel that it is enough. Take your time and relax by the waterfall. The view of the waterfall, is best in any level you are at."
"I was an engineer for the project. Despite the fact that I have worked at the very same place on daily basis for almost 3 years, it never failed to amaze me every time I visit. Not sure about other, but it always reminds me of the Jurassic Park, of course, without the dinosaurs."
I visited the Jewel as I was early for my flight - it is well worth a visit! I payed to enter the gardens and to visit the Canopy Bridge - its crazy this is in an airport!
This place so beautiful that we are speechless about it. This place is marvelous an indoor waterfall and forest. This place located at terminal-1 of Changi airport. I strongly recommend all tourists to visit this place.
"Singapore is truly a unique place, and this airport is no exception. It has the largest indoor waterfall, and it's very fun to get views of it from the four or five different levels, all the way at the base, to almost at the very top. It's very beautiful to walk around and take in the interesting scenery. There are tons of shops and places to eat in a very condensed place. We checked in early so we could have some time to wander around."
This is really amazing never seen anything like this anywhere in the world. The view of the waterfall is breathtaking and very relaxing. You can go to different level and view the waterfall. You can get better view of waterfall on level 3. There are plenty seating areas to enjoy this waterfall. If you are in the airport this is a must visit.
We chose to have a long layover in Singapore (15hrs) to be able to explore it for a day. This adventure started at the airport which we could have stayed in for the entire 15 hours without getting bored. They have many unique free things to do and see while you wait in the airport including a butterfly garden! This particular airport has been rated top in the world for the past 6 years and has definitely earned that title. The Jewel is the latest in their attractions and now holds the world record for the largest indoor waterfall. Hidden near the arrival hall of terminal 1 this is worth stopping by. This end of the airport includes a high end shopping mall with many international stores which hide the waterfall while adding more mystique to the attraction. There are many levels of stairs and walkways surrounding the jewel to allow you to get different perspectives of it and the iconic selfie by it. While we were there they had signs displayed that mentioned new additions to the Jewel experience this year which include a canopy bridge. This entire area of the airport will be adding over 10 new attractions estimated by the end of this year (2019). We highly advise stopping by even for a small layover to at least witness the airport for yourself. Keep in mind if you have a layover for over 5 hours the airport also offers free tour bus rides of Singapore as well!- @wanderingwithustwo
"Been there multiple times and I haven't yet step into every single shop! I've been to different restaurants every time I went there and their service and food are good! Airport has always been a good hang out place and ever since Jewel's arrival, it just made things much better and enjoyable!For families with kids, I suggest you guys to visit the Canopy Park at the top floor! They will have tons of fun there!"
"Had a 10- hour layover and after sleeping at the hotel at the airport, we checked out the Jewel, which opened in October 2019. It's lush, peaceful, and air-conditioned, but you feel like you are outside. Definitely worth spending some time to see it - I viewed a documentary about it on a Singapore Airlines flight - it is immaculate and they do a great job of keeping it in tip-top shape."
This is one amazing place located at the airport. The vortex and indoor forest and almost too real.. Nice glass Walkway to see the vortex.
"you can have a walk around and check out the waterfall area. it is beautiful and with all the floral, is like you walk into a forest.It has a lot of cafes and restaurant.Best of all, it has Pokemon Center!!!"
Best airport in the world with best amenities. The waterfall is amazing and also the flower garden and canopy bridge. Well connected from the main airport.
When we landed at Changi Airport they were screening for corona virus and asked a lot of questions. We were good to enter Singapore from Canada. This airport is so beautiful out of a story book. The Jewel is outstanding and we enjoyed it very very much.
The Rain Vortex is absolutely mesmerising. Make sure to catch the show if you are visiting in the evening! Each show lasts about 5 mins and runs from 8.30pm to 12.30am daily at hourly intervals. Hands down the best experience you can get at an airport!
This is really amazing and worth the visit. Make sure you watch the light show in the evening at the indoor waterfall. It's really relaxing just sitting and watching the waterfall here during anytime of the day. I have visited a few times when returning to Singapore at Terminal 1. Changi airport has always been amazing but the Jewel took it to a new level. Would definitely recommend it.
"Jewel is the latest attraction in Changi Airport. It comprises of fashion shops, eateries and exclusive attractions such as mirror maze, canopy park, hedge maze etc. The main attraction of Jewel is the rain vortex! It is gorgeous!"
"Basically this is a entry free version of the flower dome from Gardens by the bay.If you are flying out, make sure you do not go through customs. The Jewel is a public access mall. Problem is with the your bags. As trolleys are not allowed in the elevator(what are they thinking when they design this place). As a trade off, there is a baggage storage at ground level.Best light show happens after dark."
"if you are in Singapore and missed jewel changi then your trip is useless.jewel has so much to offer you for whole day.actually its a part of airport it self but you can't visit if you don't have visa for Singapore bcz you have to pass through immigration then you may go there by free airport bus.i planned my visit on first day only after i landed in Singapore. bcz my flight arrival was at morning 10.30 so i planned my first day till evening 7.00 there only. around 7pm there is free sound and light show at HSBC rain vortex don't miss it.basement to floor 5th so much to see, shopping, etc. and on 5th floor there are few activities you must try. buy its combo tickets from its website only. don't buy separate attractions on website.for me bouncing net and mirror maze was very exciting. you may jump as much you can on bouncing net. forget your age and just chill."
"Don't visit Singapore , or transit via Changi Airport without visiting 'The Jewel' ! The name is well deserved : Impressive construction , beautiful indoor waterfall surrounded by an indoor tropical garden , great shopping and restaurants within the structure..."
This is an absolutely must see when you are in Singapore. Entrance is free but there are some charge options. We spent about 3 hours there and had a wonderful time
Staying in Crowne Plaza so exploring here was essential. It was slightly subdued because of the reduction in travellers.But the centre piece indoor waterfall is outstanding. Only in Singapore would you find such imaginative architecture. Watching the falls change colour as two trains perfectly synchronised passed each other behind them was awe inspiring
"Who would ever says they are impressed with airports? They basically serve a purpose. Some are good and some are not but Singapore Airport is a whole new level. The airport has to be one of the most organised and cleanest places we've travelled to. We stayed for one night at Crowne Plaza.The Jewel is land-side between terminals 2 and 3 and is very aptly named. It tends to be restaurants, coffee lounges and so on. There are several bars on the top level. There are some tourist attractions to visit and if you are passing through Singapore, I'd suggest you take time out to include this place. I would not say that about any other airport we've been through! Many airlines have a bag drop so you can get rid of your suitcase early and relax before you go air-side through security for your flight. Even air-side there is plenty to do and see.The world's biggest waterfall is impressive and in the evening from 7.30pm they do light shows with music."
Singapore is known for so many Malls! And this one is really amazing and worth the visit. Make sure you watch the light show in the evening at the tallest indoor waterfall.It's relaxing and peaceful just sitting and watching the waterfall here during anytime of the day. I have visited many times and will be keep going time to time
"We had a wait for conecting flight at the airport so jumped onto the conecting train and headed over to the Jewel. Fantastic experiance one I'm happy to have taken. The airport is amazing but the Jewel took it to a new level. Floor 5 is outstanding great restaurants, the water fall, the flower walk, just awesome. The shops were great but for me the whole place has to be an experiance not to be missed."
"We were amazed at the design of the place.So much thought has gone into the design. The shops are a shopaholics dream. There are many restaurants available including a Pizza Express where we enjoyed a lovely meal.The most amazing part for us was the waterfall and the planting and the gardens.The best bit was at 9.30pm when they have a light show on the fountain, just amazing. It has to be seen to be fully appreciated. So glad we came to see it and would definitely recommend it."
We had a chance to fly through the Singapore Changi airport. The Jewel at Terminal 1 is something that cannot be missed. The waterfall is a sight to behold. Take the escalators to the top floor and there are bars and restaurants overlooking the waterfall and gardens. At each level in between are more restaurants and shopping. You will think you are in a high-end mall and not an airport terminal. The Jewel has to be seen to be believed!
"Jewel Changi Airport will definitely be an ideal location to carry out wedding proposal. Although it is a nerve-wrecking experience to carry out wedding proposal in a crowded place, there is no worry of rain or shine as it is an indoor environment. With just simple preparation, coupled with the setting - she worn the diamond on 20th May 2019 at 1314hr."
The airport itself is a tourist attraction. It's super modern and at the same time close to nature feels. Waiting for a long flight scheduled? Jewel got your back!
"We really enjoy our quality hours at Jewel shopping mall Changi airport, not only for shopping and eating, but also for exploring an amazing Neo- futurism architectural style. This iconic building is designed by the world- renowned architect Moshe Safdie, (a 81 years old, Israeli-born who is behind iconic Marina Bay Sands resort). It is opened in April 2019 to welcome 300,000 visitors per day, so far we heard that over 50 millions have visited it. The highlight of Jewel atrium is the largest indoor water fall - 40 meters high rain vertex and 5 storey-forest-valley with walking trails. This iconic spot is highly recommended especially at night time you will be able to marvel the colorful light show."
"Nestled at the heart of Changi Airport is this work of art that even Picasso can't even believe. Name better way to welcome a tourist coming from overseas to Singapore. I bet you can't. Jewel is indeed Singapore's Jewel alongside with the famous Gardens by the Bay. Such an eyecandy. And to all the tourist travelling SG, please, do yourself a favor, before going to your homestay or hotel, walk an extra meter to see this work of art."
Nice place for shopping and in built magnificent waterfall is awesome to view and overall a nice experience
"The best place to waste time whilst waiting to catch your flight. Magnificent architecture and gardens around waterfall. Shopping, food courts etc- entertainment- it's a great way to kill a few hours."
Wow what can I say.... This gem will knock sports of most attractions and certainly any global airport.If you are not flying from T1 and can get to the airport a little earlier then get yourself over to 'The Jewel' around 10min walk from T3. I promise you this you will not be disappointed.A must see ï¸
"We flew from Changi to Sydney and were eager to visit the recently opened Jewel.We checked in for our flight then followed the signs, which are clearly displayed, to this amazing feature.It was very crowded, and we didn't want to miss our flight so we weren't able to spend as long as we would have liked, but it certainly takes your breath away. The lifts were very slow and jam packed so that made it harder to see everything. I gave up and walked down instead.This wonderful attraction is linked to three of its passenger terminals, and was quite a walk for us from check in.Built in a huge glass dome, the centrepiece is the astonishing Rain Vortex, the tallest indoor waterfall in the world. It's surrounded by lush vegetation and terraces where you can sit and gaze at it in all its glory.The site covers over 8 acres and has 12 storeys, 7 of which are at basement level.The glass and steel facade was actually designed by the same architects who designed the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, with its iconic ship perched on the top of the building.The Shiseido Forest Valley is one of Asia's largest indoor gardens. It covers around 22,000 square metres and spans 5 stories. It's extraordinary to think that there are around 3,000 trees and 60,000 shrubs from all around the world.But it's piece de resistance has to be the astonishing Rain Vortex waterfall which dominates the centre of the garden, and stands 130 ft high. It cascades down from a round hole in the glass ceiling and an incredible 38,000 litres of recirculating rain water is pumped through the hole every minute. Below it is a huge basement level pool.The glass roof, which is toroid shaped, is made up of over 9,000 pieces of glass. At night it becomes the 360 degree backdrop for a light and sound show, which sadly we could not stay for.It's a truly astonishing piece of engineering and design, and it is incredible to think that it is inside an airport.We just didn't have time to visit the canopy park, which is about $5 to enter, or the canopy mazes, but I was able to walk down to the bottom of the waterfall and stand and gaze in awe at its beauty.It seems odd to want to spend more time in an airport, but there is still so much to see here in Jewel that I hope one day to return."
"I didn't believe that an airport could actually be a destination, but this one is. If you are visiting Singapore, or have a layover, you MUST spend time in this airport. Best if you can visit ""The Jewel"" at night, but beautiful any time. The entire airport is worth exploring."
"wide range of food selection, food is nice and lots of seat inside teh resturant, impressive design and you will not know is this an airport."
"It's no surprise that this has been voted the best airport in the world 7 times. The indoor waterfall is spectacular - even better when the light shows are on. There are lots of things to do, though you do have to pay for some of them. There are plenty of eateries, but allow time if you are travelling at the weekend."
"The team is friendly and courteous, the pokemon explorer unable to detect the blue tooth signal and some is not available. Long queue in eatery.Apart from that, it is a nice day at jewel. Beautiful environment and excellent toilet cleanliness and hygenie"
"Returned to Jewel for another visit last month, there not being so many things to do on a rainy day in Singapore. Unfortunately it was very busy and there were long queues for most of the activities. Still impressive to see the indoor waterfall though."
Awesome foodSlow serviceThe food came before we got our cutleries and I had to ask the servers twice before we could get them. First one I asked was new I think? As he was not wearing the prive uniform but overall great experience
Short waiting time. Fun and new activities. Some children door gifts will be nice. Theme according to festival. More small animals like rabbits or hamsters (trained ones)
"After visiting the Jurassic Mile, it was a lovely walk in fine weather along the Changi Airport Connector to Terminal 2 along well-landscaped path (2 km). It was a novel way for me to reach the Jewel via the elevated Linkbridge from Terminal 2. Under normal circumstances, I rely on the skytrain to hop between terminals. The view along the Linkbridge was pretty with view of the Control Tower and the Jewel. We ate our lunch here. The shops and restaurants are opened and it has a lively atmosphere. Great place to dine and stroll."
"The centrepiece of the Jewel is the waterfall that falls from the ceiling of the dome. Officially known as the Rain Vortex, at 40 metres high it's the world's tallest indoor waterfall. You can see this from all the angles and beautifully lit at night when the colour changes"
It is a new shopping in Changi airport. Obviously the most attractive object in this mall is the artificial waterfall which is right in the middle of the mall. I liked the design which give a sense of the forest feel. There is no observation deck but you view it from different floors. The mall offered variety of branded goods. It is an expensive place for shopping at least I enjoyed the windows shopping the free air-cond as the climate in Singapore was really hot during the time I visited.
"We went to see JEWEL at Terminal 1 on our way out of Singapore. Must see when inSingapore. Multilevel greenery in Terminal 1 with a tremendous waterfall, 40 meters tall, in the center, dropping from the ceiling and disappearing into the floor, on level 1. Your view of this amazing waterfall changes with the level you are viewing from. There is greenery throughout this immaculately clean airport."
"A great place to spend time in transit. Early checkin for several airlines saved the day, and allowed us to look around more freely."
"We spent a day here (including having lunch in the middle), the waterfall was a beautiful sight. We bought a package to enter the canopy park and do all the attractions. Loved the Mirror maze, the mist bridge and the bouncy nets. The net walk was harder and scarier than we expected, little feet go through the net. See the waterfall from all the different levels using the elevator. Kids loved this place (aged 6 and 9)"
"We had a 2am flight so arrived with plenty of time to explore the Jewel. Wasn't aware everything closes early. The light show on the waterfall was still on and amazing. Wheelchair friendly mostly everywhere. Sorry we missed it during open hours. Found it difficult to find somewhere to eat. Was a weekend so perhaps could look at later closing hours. Accessibility amenities available. And lifts, just spread out."
The Jewel at Changi Airport is a delightful step away from the traditional airport building. The combination of an amazing attraction with many retail and restaurant options in an airport location is alluring to both tourists as well as locals.
If you have about 20 minutes to spare then head down to the magnificent Jewel terminal which has a stunning waterfall and a lot of indoor greenery. We walked to it from inside the departure terminal before checking in for our flight.
Never in my dreams would I expect to see a waterfall in an airport - but there it is.We were early for our flight and we'd read about the Jewel opening in 2019 so decided to go and eat plus sightsee.The planted forest and waterfall area is truly breathtaking. We were lucky as there were fewer visitors due to virus fears as I can imagine it gets very crowded in the centre.The rest of the mall is 10 floors of shopping and eating. You can also check in and store bags if you want to walk around unencumbered
"This is the latest addition to Changi Airport. It's huge with lots of shops and restaurants, as well as activities such as the Canopy Walk, maze etc. The trees and greenery really make it lovely. There are also flight check in counters here, where you can do an early check in, and then relax and wander around the place."
"Passed by many times and the rain of the sight of the rain vortex had never failed to arrest me. A few moment to admire the scene (definitely) then quick snaps of photos (if short of time) or a rest in the ""forest"" to watch the water flowing down. The place was always crowded with local and tourist alike but I could feel myself relax down. Kid really enjoyed it. An oasis right amidst the hustle bustle. If you transit or arrive in Singapore, recommend to come and admire this architect marvel."
A brilliant design and architecture.a jewel in an airport indeed.a great place to spend time in waiting your flight.
"We came there only for the waterfall and the green sourroundings, but we observed that there were quite a few restaurants, cinema etc. in addition to the waterfall.Very nice waterfall, and a great building."
We thought we would visit the Jewel whilst we were waiting for our flight so we asked at the information desk how to get to it. The lady was very helpful but told us we would really need five hours to visit because you need to go back through immigration and need plenty of time to walk around it. Unfortunately we did not have the time but she recomended taking the Skytrain between terminals 2 and 3 which passes right through the Jewel and slows down as you pass through. We made a trip there and back on the Skytrain so was able to marvel at the plantings and that spectacular waterfall. Would factor in extra time to your travel arrangements if you can. It's pretty awesome.
This is a large part of the airport which is big enough in itself and gives it a really modern feel to it with an architecture of its own
"This man made structure is amazing. Located by the Airport and mall, it strategically showcases and introduces the waterfall admist shopping and eating outlets. Very popular with locals and tourists."
"Amazing - we loved exploring the canopy and the mirror maze. We had dinner downstairs in the food court which was clean, delicious and reasonably priced. We were also able to arrange point of pick up for grab car without having to venture back to the terminal. Unfortunately we had to play tag team to look around as we needed for someone to mind the suitcases and bags. As a family of 4 it was way to expensive to pay for storage."
"The Jewel is within the Airport Complexes, a short distance from the Arrival at Terminal 1. It has a Mall with an impressive waterfall coming from the glass ceiling of a dome. It is surrounded by greenery. I has a high humidity. There are railway tracks for small trains to travel within the dome. As with all Malls, there are restaurants, cafes, bars and shops. It is worth a visit as there are no other in the world (as far as I know).I was there very early when I landed at 9.00am in Singapore. It is a popular place and gets crowded. Enjoy!"
"Directly go to Jewel Changi after arrived in Terminal 4, this place was really huge and still feels good because it's indoor and the AC is cooling properly. Too bad that the 2nd level of waterfall which is I just known called rain vortex is under maintenance, but the 1st level is still there. It's really crowded when I visit this place but it's still acceptable."
"Very hot and humid but very cool to see cascading water like this. It's no Niagara Falls, but this made for a nice first impression to Singapore. It's just really really crowded. The mall it is inside of is real nice."
"Visiting the waterfall is a must. I wouldn't recommend eating here though, it's very expensive compared to downtown."
"I visited Jewel on my way home from Singapore and got to the airport especially to check out Jewel.There's a lot to see here - apart from the Rain Vortex, there are activities available on level 5 / the top floor which unfortunately you have to pay for (I didn't this time), there's a hotel where you can book a room for a few hours to dump your bags, have a snooze and refresh, and there is a massive amount of shops and eateries here - so much choice.Due to it being Christmas time whenI visited, they had a Christmas market section on level 5.Concierge staff are very helpful and there are plenty of signs available to navigate your way around Jewel. There's also plenty of lifts for people with strollers or in wheelchairs, and the bathrooms are delightfully decorated.Well worth visiting if you have the time to spare when arriving or departing the airport."
"We are regular visitors of Jewel as this is a nice option to entertain before taking flights, especially at night. We really enjoy the canopy and our kids love to do the bouncing over there.The rain vortex is the main attraction, and remains always impressive to see.What a surprise to discover that for Christmas, the rain vortex was closed on L1 and L2 ! They ask you to get a receipt with 50 SGD spending to get a view of what has always been in free access until now... Even if you would abide by the rule, this is almost impossible as we use Jewel only a few hours before flying and don't have time to get to restaurant, get the right receipt, have it redeemed and then enter what should be a normal area of the mall. This is a very sad evolution of Jewel. Doesn't make good publicity to Shiseido to have their name associated to such a discrimative endeaviour. I understand we have to pay for canopy which is an attraction. I dont understand why we should be prevented to wander in a mall."
Jewel is a must go attraction if u are a tourist. The waterfall is magnificent. Sad to say that the retail shops and restaurant service in Jewel is not up to standard. It's jus a typical shopping mall.
"Its not just another shopping mall. Its a place where you can visit attractions, experience and do different activities. There are lots of indoor greenery, with exotic plants to explore, activities that you can do (located on the 4th and 5th floors), have a meal with a view of an indoor waterfall, see a lights show (scheduled timings) etc. Do note that there are some activities which require covered footwear for safety. Can spend about 1/2 day to explore the place. Highly recommended!"
"Being a particularly wet day and having a few hours to kill, we decided on going to the ""Jewel at Changi Airport"".What an amazing dome! Absolutely huge from the outside and stunning inside with an abundance of shops and restaurants. Unfortunately most tended to be on the very expensive end of the scale but nevertheless well worth a visit to see the stunning decorations and displays. The cascading waterfall was quite breathtaking and as day gave way to nightfall and the many coloured lights reflected of the water, it became quite magical.Due to the very large crowd in attendance, photo opportunities were rather limited but that aside, well worth a visit."
"Changi airport has so much to see and do. It's the perfect airport to while away the hours whilst transitting between flights.Our family of 4 had a 6 hour transit at Changi en route from Australia to London. We arrived into Changi's terminal 1 at about 630pm. We could have easily spent time wandering around the many shops in the airport terminal but instead we took our cabin bags with us, quickly and easily cleared immigration and walked directly from terminal 1 into the new adjoining Jewel complex. The Jewel is housed in a glass dome and is a massive retail shopping mall that also has a few attractions.The main attraction is the indoor garden and rain vortex. We visited in December and in order for 2 people to gain access to the ground level of the indoor garden we had to spend 50 SGD in the Jewel complex. There was no other way to enter. I am not sure if this was because the indoor garden was lit up for Christmas, or because there was a special Christmas dance show on, plus regular (very short) light shows, or whether spending money in the Jewel is the only way to gain access to the garden year round. In any event, it was great to see the rain vortex up close.We then made our way to level 5, which can only be accessed from lift foyers C and E. There are many bars and restaurants on this top floor of the complex, and it is also home to the canopy park and its attractions.The canopy park seemed to be endless and it was lovely to wander around it. There are a number of ticketed attractions inside the canopy park. My family enjoyed the canopy nets (there are walking and jumping options - we chose the walking nets because the jumping ones were booked out for the rest of the evening). There was also a hedge maze and a mirror maze, which we resolved to check out next time we transit through Singapore.Some things to note:- Children under the age of 13 were not permitted to go onto any of the canopy park attractions by themselves and had to be supervised by an adult (thus requiring an adult ticket to the attraction to be purchased in addition to the children's tickets). In our case, the other adult stayed with all the cabin bags!- Entry to any of the canopy park attractions includes entry to the canopy park itself. Given one of our adults was staying with the bags and not going on the canopy nets, we were able to purchase 'canopy park only admission' for 5 SGD for that person to allow them to enter the park.- Canopy park admission includes a small number of attractions - the foggy pools (perfect for toddlers), the topiary walk, petal garden and discovery slide.- The attractions closed at 10pm the night we were there."
"The man made waterfall was beautiful ,it also has a very short light show at night.There were a lot of restaurants and stores to shop.Overall it was quite nice.It is great place to take pictures."
"I go from T4 by bus to T2, then walk to Jewel and it is worthy.Amazing water fall (with light show at night), big shopping mall and many things to do and eat."
"A spectacular waterfall, which can be seen from within the Jewel or from the train transitting from Terminals 2 to 3. The train slows down as it passes by the waterfall. The place was very busy and looks like any other shopping mall in Singapore, except the waterfall. It is worth a visit."
"Did a transit at Changi Airport on our way to Christchurch last month and the information counter staff gave us wrong information regarding Jewel. She told us that there is a Entrance Fee of S$50 to Jewel due to many visitors. We out off the idea visiting JewelOn my business trip to Singapore on 11/12, we ask the cleaner and he told us just walk till the end of the Terminal 3 Check-In Lobby(Right Hand side)! It took us the most 10 minutes walk and here we are!Very nice place. The ambiance is good. The man made colour waterfall is nicer than most waterfalls that I have seen.The waterfall is surrounded by a lot of restaurants.Good place to hang around if you arrive early at ChangiDisappointed on the wrong information provided by the Information Counter inside Changi Airport Terminal 2 & 3 or my family would have check out on this place during our transit to Christchurch recently"
"But do keep in mind that you can only access it prior to going through passport controlThe center piece waterfall is beautiful but too too crowded.I wish they would do as Dubai mall and restrict the immediate area to paying customers. This way everyone is happy.There are a lot of restaurants, retail shops, souvenir shops and cafesIf you're flight is later in the afternoon and you have to check out, you can spend some time herePlz give this review a thumbs up"
"This is something you should do on any Singapore stay, go see Singapore's newest attraction, Jewel. This great 8 storied domed attraction is a combination of a mall and indoor activities with this mammoth waterfall inside that flows from top to bottom. I have no idea how tall it is but I suppose it's all available if you ""Google it"".We wandered around for hours. Yes there is so much to see and it's well laid out plus it gave us the opportunity to have a ""Western"" lunch. To tell the truth I was craving a milk shake and when we stumbled upon a Shake Shack where we indulged in a Hot Dog, Hamburger, Fries and a Strawberry Shake. Just the type of meal you don't usually have in S.E Asia.The only negative I could think of about the Jewel is that there are many places to go or things to see that you have to pay for the privilege of taking part in. You guessed it. We didn't. That said it did not spoil a good day out."
"We had just arrived from Australia and it said we had to spend $50 at participating stores to get into the Jewel for a Christmas light show. We couldn't figure out where we wanted to spend $50, and we had to store our luggage somewhere, and that would have cost us $40, so we decided to just watch it from the side."
we arrived at Terminal 2 Changi so we headed to Jewel by walking which is at Terminal 1. I guessed we were just want to look around and have fun while taking the refreshing mist from the water fall
"i landed at changi T4 which i should be transferring by bus to T2 & Jewel (no worries, the bus available every 5 minutes), but on the busy period, you need to purchase minimum of SGD 50 at the airport to enter Jewel (they dont have any entrance fee)."
The view of the water vortex is really amazing! Transfers from different airport terminals is no fuss and a visit to this airport is truly worth it.
The airport mall has become a destination in its own right!Noticed on our second visit though most people browse lots but spend little in the retail stores. Most are going for eats and viewing the huge waterfall. Good way to while away an hour or two.
"The waterfall and garden area is very nice, albeit very crowded. But in the end, it's yet another shopping mall. Definitely whoa look."
"This newly open mall, just open in Apr 2019, is a large convenient mall opposite to Changi airport Terminal 3. It has many interesting shops and restaurants but the most impressive thing here is the big waterfall with changing lights and the water flow down from the roof in such a magical way. Recommend"
It is truly a picture perfect masterpiece. it is accessible in all terminals. nice dome with plants and malls inside. a must see when in Singapore.
"very nice to visit such a unique place, especially for an airport but Singapore Changi definitely does not disappoint. One of my favourite airport in the world. Can get very crowded so beware of the crowds. Restaurant selection is ok only and the popular ones usually have a very long queue. Go early or make reservation"
"Visited Jewel Changi when it was recently opened so it's still pretty crowded.A good variety of restaurants, the famous water feature and the netting walk at the top level.It felt a bit warm & humid during the afternoon when I was there, probably because of the water feature and the fact you can't air condition the place properly in such a big open space.But it's still worth at least one visit."
"Very convenient to come to this place by MRT. Specially if your flight is at midnight, it is good to come early and go around this place. They even have a movie house. Good for relaxing."
but beware that to get the closest and best views you'll need to buy a ticket. Otherwise a beautiful and amazing waterfall in the middle of the mall next to the Changi Airport.
"We were there because we had some spare days in SGP. It will take an hour to reach here from anywhere in the city. There is not much to do in form of activities. You can take a stroll or stay near the rain vortex. The paid attractions are quite unimaginative. Its better to just stroll for a while, eat/drink something and just take a bus ride back."
"Well got here about five hours early for our flight ; but didn't bother me as I was under the impression there was lots to do at the airport . There isn't ; there are plenty of places to grab something to eat and some duty free and other shops , but I think they were all rather expensive . Went to butterfly garden and it was smaller than I thought it would be and I didn't see one butterfly ; might of had something to do with the fact that it was nighttime ; but if that's the case they should put a sign up to let people know ; do butterflies sleep at night ,I don't know and obviously neither did all the other people that were in there expecting to see butterflies"
"My husband & myself loved peranakan food. We were at the Jewel, Violet Oon's restaurant for dinner last night . We ordered the mango salad, Ngoh Hiang, udang bakar with sambal & Ayam buah keluah. All the dishes was delicious except for the Ayam buah keluah. It was so sour. When the dish arrived it looks so good that both of us scoop a big spoon full of the gravy onto our rice and mixed it. Thereafter,our plate of rice became extremely sour & spicy that every spoon full of it into our mouth was so difficult to swallow. In order not to waste food we tried very hard to finish the ayam(chicken). It was not the original peranakan taste.Sad and sorry to say that the dish was horrible. Feedback to the waiter , was told that Asam and chilies were added. The dish was eventually waive off on our bill. We left the restaurant with a sour face."
"First things first, we walked a lot, I mean a lot. So be prepared if you want to go to see the amazing waterfall. It was a good experience as we had some no of hours for our flight. We did not go anywhere else to be honest, just roamed around the waterfall, with all the greenery."
"i end up at Jewel Changi Airport after i'm finish up my assignn't at other place in singapore....suprisingly, Jewel really easy to found from mrt station at terminal 3 coz of large and clear signboard...after a long walk( about 15 min ), finally indoor waterfall caught my eyes with spectacular view...really nice and feel calm with indoor tree, cleanliness and sound of waterfall....but...as a muslim, there have several thing maybe need to be improve, such as food and praying place...to me, no suitable food court or shop can i buy food. Same situation with praying place. there's no praying place and halal food in Jewel...maybe, in departure hall at terminal 1 have halal food and praying place, but that terminal 1 really far...maybe Changi airport management can improve the facilities for muslims in the future..."
"We had some time to kill before our late flight. Saw a movie in the basement. Got food from the ""hawker stalls"". But, the waterfall (at least) was shutdown for 8 days for yearly maintenance; so missed the part I wanted to see. Not sure if the hikes were open."
"Read a lot about this water feature and the shopping areas but when I finally visited, I must say I am disappointed.Singapore had a similar water feature at the Suntec city previously and this just seems to be a relocated unit! Sound system is so bad and smells of bad chemicals when near it. 5 minutes was all I can handle."
"The new airport is really beautiful with indoor waterfalls and plants and there are lots of newly opened shops and restaurants. However, it is rather crowded due to the influx of travelers hence might have to queue for some restaurants. Recommended to visit if you're stopping in Singapore for a short while before your next flight!"
"Per most guide books, sounds like this place is very near to T2. However, this is misleading! It involves quite some walk from T2, though connected with a bridge. Today with a flight delay, thus spare enough time to visit this place.If you plan to take a quick look before departing, pls reserve more time to do so. It is actually a big shopping mall, nothing relates to Changi Airport.Also, most international airlines are located at T4. You can only reach T2 via free shuttle, which takes another 15 mins.The fountain is the only attraction, and have to pay various fees to go inside."
"The lighting show was good, but long waiting ended in 3 minutes. Considering traveling all the way from tao payoh to Changi just for 3 minute show just not worth it. To me, mbs still the best compare to jewel and Sentosa.However no doubt, the food here is nice."
"Managed to pay a visit to Jewel following an inbound flight arrival at Terminal 1. A new, nice and big shopping mall! Just not my thing so ..... Visited and tried their food hall (food court) in Basement 2 called Five Spices. There is a good variety of stalls and we tried 3 of them. They are Saravanaa Bhavan ($7.50), Nasi Ayam Taman Serasi ($5.50) and Guan's Mee Pok ($6.50). Of course prices are dependent on what you order. You can refer to my photos. All served decent quality food but as expected, it is rather pricey and not a lot of food ..... understandably so given the venue location. It is not a very large food hall so the number of tables are somewhat limited. I would recommend that you transit over to the food hall in the Basement of Terminal 3. Much better if you are looking for a more ""local"" feel and larger variety and more places to sit. But if you are looking to kill time and to window shop or shop then this is it at the airport."
"We had planned on enjoying Jewel before our evening flight, and to us it was just another typical stopping makl, with a spectacular water feature.We were able to find good dining, but once out of the dining places there was only a very small number of cushions on which to sit.So basically nowhere to sit and rest.We gave up and went to the departure lounge where we could sit.The early check-in at SIA was excellent though.Wouldn't bother going to Jewel again."
"The Jewel is beautiful, it is my second time here and I am pleased with the cleanliness and the exhibits they have However, it is way to crowded. Almost everything has a qeue and there is a lack of seating area for tires shoppers."
"A must visit when in Singapore .so many shops, but go to see the waterfall and beautiful trees and flower exhibits . A place I will definitely go again as it is stunning"
"From the international airport, you can catch a train that takes you from one terminal to another with the track going above the Jewel canopy and passing the waterfall. And that's it...To properly enjoy this attraction you need to clear immigration (which is possible when in transit if you have long enough) first. The large shopping centre surrounding the Jewel is quite quiet - it hasn't really taken off yet. It was nice to wander around looking at the waterfall - make sure you go to the base - one or two levels down. The shopping centre surrounds the Jewel in a circle so you need to go up levels in the shopping centre to see it all form different angles. I didn't find it clearly signposted where to find each entry on the different levels so spent more time than I had available walking in circles trying to find the entrances. Lots of places to sit and enjoy the calm"
I planned to visit and left for airport 4 hours to have enough time to visit but unfortunately could not get entry to the attraction inside since they have lease the space for some private event.many tourists at the same time was disappointed for such upcoming where there was not prior info or anything could see that it will be closed.from far only could see the place and it looks very beautiful
Extremely well built and beautiful. Is a must-visit but go on the weekdays. We went there on the weekends and the place was shoulder to shoulder with people. The shopping centre is no different from others in SG but does have a few international restaurants and we realised the menus are not well designed for single travellers.
"Despite the words ""Changi Airport"" behind the name of this property, it will take you a while to walk there. The impression that I got from the advertisement of this place made me think that it was an expansion of the airport building itself, which is not the case apparently. It was another different building with some walking distance from the airport, which could be the reason why it is promoted quite heavily with so many signs scattering around. They actually put the signs directing you to this place like literally on every corner of the airport; for departure, from the moment you get off the train you can see one of them, or for arrival, as soon as you claim your luggage, thus creating false impression that it's near. After walking for quite a while only you will find a redundant sign ""2 mins walk"" when you can already clearly see the entrance is right in front of you. Along the way I could hear some tourists concerned about the same distance going back to the airport, either for their flights or for train leaving the airport.One of its main attractions is the first permanent (hopefully) PokÃ©mon Center outside of Japan so for arriving tourists with kids who plan to visit there, please let your kids know beforehand about the walking distance.Also, like some have stated before, it is just another shopping mall. If you are waiting for your flight and have nothing you would like to find particularly at Jewel, it's more convenient to just chill and dine inside the Changi Airport building itself."
We had some time between flights and thought we would go and see the new thing. We found out that meant that we had to clear immigration and fill in those ridiculous forms - who though red was a good idea for a form with small writing?After a Skytrain ride and walk and some elevators we found the place. The waterfall is pretty cool and worth taking shots of. We were really hungry so we looked for something to eat. And looked. We finally found a food court with 'local' food hiding behind an area of fast food places with stand up eating.The foodcourt looked like it had been there for years. Cramped seating areas - perhaps all the space was used up with the waterfall. The food was average.Finally sated we wander some of the mall - but it's just the same old same old.Been. Tick. Return? No.
Already couples time here.but still amazed with this waterfull.modern unique inside a mall..the architecture they made really well think of
We visited Jewel before our flight. It was very handy to be able to check in early for Singapore Airlines at Jewel so that we didn't have any luggage with us. The gardens are beautiful and the waterfall is amazing. Eating places on the garden level appeared to be very overpriced. Mostly it seems to be a big shopping centre. It is easy to get from Jewel to the other airport terminals.
"We came early before our dawn flight and took the time to just browse around & check out the talk of the town center when all stalls were still closed.Found the huge center piece of a water funnel feature surrounded by with nice foliage with restaurants on one floor and expensive shops on another. There is another place where one has to just be prepared to empty the wallets with all types of entrance fees giving a feeling of a big let down in such a doom structure. This left us an impression of a money making center or machine at the airport. Overall, it was not impressive at all but just an huge doom shaped enclosed shopping & eating mall where there're already tons of such on earth and in Singapore."
Very touristy and shopping. Leave more time for transitting as it takes sometimes from Mall to different terminals
Everything is there. However my overall experience was negative due to the large amount of people there (it was a long weekend). Everywhere I went had a long queue
"We had a long layover at Changi airport and went to visit the Jewel. This is very convenient and easy to do. Simply go through immigration/arrivals and it's a short walk to the Jewel which is a new multi-storey shopping mall.From an engineering and architectural perspective the Jewel is very innovative and interesting. The central feature is a large, cascading rain vortex/waterfall and lots and lots of green plants.That said, it is really just a shopping mall and another place for Singaporeans to do what they do - shop, eat, shop ...It was very crowded and somewhat frenetic when I visited. I thought that it might be a nice place to relax for a few hours between flights but I actually found the airport more relaxing. Certainly worth a visit if you have time to kill but I would rather go into Singapore and walk along the river."
"During our three day stay in Singapore, we were told that we had to spend some time at Jewel, which recently opened in April, before our flight back to California. While the website advertises that Jewel is open 24 hours, we arrived at 3:00am (our international flight was at 6:00am) all all of the shops but a few restaurants were closed, the waterfall was not operating, and all of the lights in the rainforest and attraction area were off. Additionally, the early check in counter and luggage hold areas were closed as well, so we had to walk about with all of our baggage. There was something nice about being in Jewel and the airport at such an odd hour as it was empty and quiet, but it made for a disappointing Jewel visit. We were really hoping to view the waterfall in all of its glory but were unable to do so. We are certain that Jewel has a very different vibe when it is open with all of the shops, restaurants, and and attractions open and running. We would recommend a visit during opening hours."
I salute Spore for making this fake waterfall a tourist attraction.. The jewel is refreshing to look at and feel rather than just a concrete airport
"Probably can spend a day admiring, photographing, shopping, eating and watching movie at Jewel... Plus having a cup of coffee, wow really satisfied and relax..."
A mall with great amenities and indoor landscaping. There are many familiar retail shops and a wide selection of restaurants but it was just too crowded for me.
"The focus of this new destination is the high tech water feature. Apart from this, there are loads of high end shops and, eateries charging premium prices. Chances of getting run over or knocked by suitcases are very high. It's probably a good destination for transit or departing passengers to while away some spare time while waiting for their flights."
"Low standard cafe in Jewel , a latte cost $8 , but the coffee quality and staff attitude are make you walk way for it . If can MUST SKIP it , do not came here .Staff are choosing customer to service , they like you they will attend you (especially you look rich) . I was at the count, staff just skip me and service other customer behind me and ask me to queue behind them . I was waiting at the cashier point for 8min , yet she just skip me . Coffee are very low standard , coffee and milk are mix together , and diluted .She no even appologize when I tell her I am here waiting before them , but she still continue to her favorite customer. Go next door de Good cafe way better. Do not came here ."
"The mall is amazing, fantastic shops and restaurants. But... it is the most child unfriendly place I've ever experienced.It's impossible to use the lifts because they are too packed and for anyone using strollers or airport trolleys then it's a total nightmare.If anyone from CAG reads this, PLEASE consider changing the escalators to travelators so people who have suitcases (yes you are connecting to an airport), strollers and trolleys can move up and down levels. We had to take our kids off the trolleys and carry them down the escalators each time we needed to change levels then look for new ones."
"As everyone seems to believe and know, Changi is a great showpiece airport. It's got all on would wish for in an airport...except soul and thoughtfulness for the traveller. So you can get into the airport and check in your bags with clever self check machines and even cleverer self bag drop areas in Terminal 1. You can then walk across to the largest indoor waterfall, that much promoted feature that is quite beautiful when you see each floor level of the concept.Then try to see the Butterfly park and see how long it takes to get an answer from any of the airport staff as to how you get to that feature. One said go to Level 3 and walk across to terminal 3, another said you cannot get to Level 3 by lift but by elevator ....when we finally got there, another said go through security and you get to the Butterfly Park. Security , despite seeing the boarding pass and scanning for validity, said we needed to go back to Terminal 1 and go through security there and then go back to Terminal 3. When all this was done, there was no time left to see the Butterfly Park so exhausted and annoyed at the utter lack of any coherent ability of the airport or staff to offer simple instructions, we made our way to the boarding gate picking up food and drink along the way. At the boarding gate, we were told drink even bought at the airport, cannot go through the at-gate security check to be taken into the plane so we had to throw away or drink.Are there any signs anywhere that this very peculiar practice applies to Changi....NO NO NO.The airport is made for a concept of high tech efficiency but not effective wuth passengers in mind. What a shame it's only an airport after all. Try routing through other airports next time I think"
"To me, its just another shopping mall with a gigantic indoor waterfall and some paid attractions.I'm in awe with the gigantic indoor waterfall. Good thing is that it has a lot of viewing area.The paid attractions was slight pricey and doesn't seems worth it during a crazy crowded weekend."
"We had checked into our flight and decided to look at Jewel and get something to eat prior to our flight. Everyone from taxi drivers to waiters had urged us to go to the Jewel so we thought it must be super amazing. It was a long walk from the terminal and its easy to lose track of time, so be sure to factor that in if you are going prior to a flight. We were disappointed as we arrived about 745am and nothing was open. The water wasn't flowing in the waterfall either. There were lots of people just wandering around what is essentially a massive shopping centre with a really big indoor waterfall in the middle of it, and lots of plants. At 8:00am the waterfall started to flow and it was pretty cool. Kids absolutely love it. There are lots of restaurants and there are some climbing activities on the upper level that looked fun (but were not open). We had to walk back to Changi and get something to eat at Starbucks as it was the only thing open early in the morning. A bit disappointing but overall its worth a look and to take some pics."
"I was interested to see the 'Jewel' at Changi when transiting through yesterday, after hearing so much gushing praise about it. However I was frankly left cold. You see, Singapore needs more shopping malls like an oil millionaire needs more Ferraris; once you reach a certain level of redundancy then adding another seems like a waste of space. Oh sure, it has a fancy fountain in the middle that looks like a giant's sphincter but after 11 hours in a plane it's hard to be impressed by yet another mall with a water feature. If another shopping opportunity is the best that Singapore can do, it's hard to feel excited by the overall lack of imagination."
"There's not a whole lot to see here, other than the indoor fountain, which can be explored around several levels. At the top most level, you can walk around to view the fountain. Worth a visit if you're in the area or have a layover - but not worth going all the way to Changi for it."
"Before our flight we decided to see the Jewel. The waterfall is nice, the rest is just a mall full of Singaporean's standing in line for food. Not a place for travellers. It's just another mall..."
"Went to Changi early before our flight home to see the famous attraction and was disappointed,most of the attractions were not going to be open until June 10:so all we basically saw was the spectacular waterfall and another mass shopping mall, To pass away the time went to the movies at the centre,which cost us $4 each."
"A huge shopping centre with numerous restaurants. Crowded with locals and tourists. Snaking queue for Shake Shack. The main attraction, HSBC Vortex is lovely, good for photos but was crowded most of the time. Good for passengers to pass some time while waiting for their flights."
"Let's start with the good:1. Amazing mall and amenities.2. Easy access to the airport3. Good restaurants4. Early check-in for select airlines (CHECK BEFORE GOING)And the bad (why it is only getting 3 stars):1. Scraping the barrel with brands. When Shake Shack has the pole position in a brand new $1.7b mall and is rubbing shoulders on that same level with Tokyu Hands and Muji, makes me worry...2. Drop off has NO ACCESS TO EARLY CHECK IN!!! Beware. If you are thinking that this is a HK IFC style set-up, you will be sadly mistaken. The Jewel drop off is located a level above the early check-in, there are NO CARTS provided and the carts (even if there were any) are not allowed in the mall to go down to the early check-in. Horrible design and just a shame since they were so close to getting it right... How are you supposed to use the early check in if you can't even get to it???3. Hotel: The Yotel is a joke. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME! It is very hard to get to (up on L4), the rooms are no larger than a closet and if you have bags with you, as point 2 states, you can't get a baggage cart to take them to the hotel with you...Other than that, thought it was an amazing place!"
"In spite of all the hype, Jewel Changi is just a massive shopping mall near a big international airport. Shops, shops and shops - and most of them the same brands and chains you can find anywhere in the world.What makes it different is the giant spectacular water feature and forest right at the center of everything. The rain vortex is indeed impressive and completely changes from day to night and from the top to the bottom levels and the forest around it is nice too.In my opinion they could turn down the hideous 'movie soundtrack' music, get rid of the loud percussion band and dull cartoons and try to make it a little more natural and interesting - but I guess that might distract people from spending money......Massive queues for most food and beverage outlets (at least on Sunday)"
"The waterfall trully impressive, but nothing else to see. The rest just a typical mall.Ps. They have a pokemon store which not every country have it. If you're a pokemon maniac, it's a must"
"We had about a 9 hour transit at Changi Airport so decided to visit the newly opened Jewel. After a long queue at immigration and a rather long walk, we reached the Jewel. The rain vortex is indeed unique and impressive but that was the only wow factor for me. Otherwise just like any shopping centre."
"While it has the first pokemon centre out of japan, and some merchandise customised for Singapore.... else it is just a large shopping mall cum a Gardens by the bay feelIts Nike store, one of the largest in Asia which allowed u to do customisation of shoes in lace and tag.....Do note that u need to exit your terminal to get to jewelTo have a better view of the garden and to enjoy some of its facilities- it s good to do it daytime (from mid june 2019 onwds)Do not just focus on the light show of the vortex fountain!"
"This is the shopping mall with the tallest indoor waterfall in the world. Besides all the major brands and restaurants, you can walk in an indoor garden without the heat. There is an early luggage check-in counter for people who decides to shop around before leaving the country. Because it is a new mall, it is relatively crowded and some areas need to be sorted out still."
"After all the promotion and promise to make Singapore Airport the best of the world, Jewel seems to come out short delivering all that had promised.After walking around the building during preview, it is just a big shopping mall. Its true that Jewel does have a few more international brands that you may not get in other malls, but the price is higher.Understand most photo focus on the water fountain, but it is very similar to the one at MBS only bigger. The place was very crowded, and most facilities are yet to open during the preview. Most restaurants are not ready for the crowd yet, so ordering food does take awhile.If you happens to drop by Singapore do go and have a look, it may worth to check in for you social media and a few photos. Tickets are available online with a few simple steps, but the mall will be open to public soon."
"The garden and waterfall are nice, but this is basically a mall full of global shopping. There are no nice restaurants or bars with good views. Instead, they are all brightly lit and cheaply furnished. If you're traveling with children, they may enjoy the canopy walk or maze, but for adults, the place is a bore.Much ado about nothing."
"My Singaporean in-law insist we go inside the waterfall part of Jewel, the new over priced over crowded mall of chaos with extra luggage next to the Airport.You need a $50 spend in the over priced shops to enter the Jewel waterfall. We spent this and more on four burgers ($80) and had the ticket given to us by my Brother in law with QR code.Get to the entrance and line up literally everyone in line gets to the ""gate-keepers"" is queried for ages , then walks away without getting in .Literally 10 or so people.Weird...When we get there the ""gate-keeper"" says we have to show receipts from meal , not the QR thingy (or maybe both she doesnt say)Leave like the others, maybe they could organise / signage this better or train staff or both.View the fake waterfall from outside and leave.Just go to airport , it's better."
The jewel lounge facilities are quite nice and efficient. However one of its staff members looking after the catering and shower facilities Fhazli had a lot of attitude and put off many a passenger. I feel he needs to be retrained big time and needs to change his mindset on servicing passengers rather than show a total lack efficiency and disinterest.We used the lounge between 11 am and 2 pm OM 13th of December 2019
"Aside of magnificent technology which discover glass waterfall, i think it was overrated. Actually it just a common mall which equipped with artifiacial waterfall. It was suitable for region which doesnt have natural waterfall attraction. There were so many attraction in this area, but we have to pay high price."
"Cashier NOT FRIENDLY...not give some SUGGESTION SELLING PRODUCTS...Packer NOT FRIENDLY TOO,refused to give request for the chicken part while order.After explain to them,they finally gave my request by showing their long face to me.Plus still can say to me "" NEXT TIME if you coming to any KFC in Singapore we don't entertain such of this request.""Then i said...WOW...sure definitely..I am gonna make sure your service will be acknowledge by your higher management.Already send my feedback to KFC website and APPS too.RegardsDziauddin Mahamud"
"COVID seems not to exist anymore.... ok you need to check in, have your temperature taken and you still need to check in and wear a facemaskbut my o my.... so many people, not distancing, people take of their masks all the time to eat and drinkwhat a disaster"
"I do not see the era of why many people are so impress and excited about this. It's man made not even natural. Compare with many other attractions in the world, it would not even stand out. And further more this place had quite a sustaintial amount of injuries since it's opening."
Took leave to enjoy our day but was not allowed into the skynets bouncing and walking with my 5 year old kid. He was just 2 cm short of 110 cm requirement. So had to leave without doing anything there. Asked for a cash refund but the management refused. So we had paid 80 for a whole family outing without doing anything. Waited for a long while for the queue as well. We booked a scheduled timing for the skynets and my boy left the scene crying
"Technically it's Just a mall with a gigantic waterfall in the middle. Don't go if u have ur baggages with u, not safe."
"Staff of jewel, by the name of Rafly Mohamad, rudely chase us away when we tried to grab a meal in Jewel upon arrival. This place requires more training of their staff before allowing them to be on duty. We gave up our meal in Jewel"
"I had a 12 hour stopover in Singapore and wanted to fill in time until 1am. I planned the day to make the most of my time in Singapore. I have been many times, but never bothered to visit the 'Jewel Changi Airport'. On the recommendation of a Singaporean friend, I decided to include the 'Jewel Changi Airport' in my stopover.I had a quick look at the ground floor of 'Jewel Changi Airport' after arriving into Singapore. It seemed ok, and I thought I could spend an hour or 2 before boarding my early morning flight. So I first went into the city and then went back to Changi Airport to spend some time in the 'Jewel Changi Airport'.On arrival I noticed that the entrance to the ground floor of 'Jewel Changi Airport' that I used during the day was now blocked with a sign and a staff member preventing entry to the ground floor of the 'Jewel Changi Airport'. I then went to the main entrance. The staff advised I needed to spend $50 in a single transaction in a shop within the 'Jewel Changi Airport' shopping mall. They called the ground floor the 'Shiseido Forest Valley'. I told the staff that had I know this earlier in the day I would have kept my receipts and now most of the shops were closed, so how can I spend $50. I already had dinner and didn't need to eat again just to spend $50. I asked the staff how else can I get entry and the staff said 'just like everyone else, get a receipt'. The staff was rude and lacked customer service. The 'Jewel Changi Airport' concierge was already closed, so I could not discuss this with them. There were not many people inside the 'Shiseido Forest Valley', so I don't understand why they couldn't just let me inside. I thought the 'Jewel Changi Airport' was meant to attract tourist, instead it appears to not want them to enter. If a local family with 5 kids arrives, they can easily spend $50 on food and beverage to gain entry, but tourists don't always have the need to spend $50, particularly if the shops are closed.I discussed this with the staff in Changi Airport's information desk, who advised the 'Jewel Changi Airport' is separate from the airport and not the same company. I told them I researched the different options and things to do in 'Jewel Changi Airport' and didn't see the special event/conditions of entry to the ground floor. They showed me where this information was on the internet and agreed it is very confusing as the same ground floor area is named differently for different events such as 'sparkling wonders of Christmas'. This makes it difficult for some tourists to get a good understanding of the special event conditions of entry.I went to each of the levels in this mall, to view the closed shops. It was like a ghost town. The top level had a few bars but very few customers. This mall claims to be 24 hours on the internet but it is not. Most facilities close early. Waste of time.I was very disappointed with the 'Jewel Changi Airport' and will never return. Next time I transit through Singapore I will go to Tampines shopping centre which is very close to the airport or Mustafa Centre which is 24 hours. The Gardens by the Bay is also a good option which is open till late.So I spent my final hours in Singapore in the Changi Airport departure terminal which does not have enough seating for travellers, so many travellers sit on the floor. Not a nice way to end a holiday."
"I heard so much about Jewel and it did seem like an interesting place to visit.The place was really overcrowded and it was just very very noisy. Thankfully I had my noise cancelling earphones with me and kept plugged in during my visit.Some shops were cramped and were split over 2 floors, they're accessible by stairs, not the most convenient for my 75 year old mom, but they might have been targeting the younger crowd with more disposable income in this case.It's just like any overcrowded new mall in this case, which was unfortunate. We left after half an hour."
"I lugged my baggage from another terminal just to see what all the hoopla was about, should have stayed and enjoyed the coffee instead.I was expecting an indoor botanical garden, but it is literally just a mall atrium that has bunch of potted plants and threes. The waterfall in the center is pretty, but not something worth going out of the way for.The scale is reminiscent of the Rainforest Cafe."
Booked with Viator. When we went to scan the passes emailed by Viator they were not valid. The staff at the Concierge were absolutely useless and unhelpful we were not able to go and enjoy the activity we had booked. Take the hit & pay on arrival. It was only when we were at the gate for the departure that we found the actual tickets in our email in a SPAM folder. Viator refused refund. We will NEVER use Viator again.
"On top of stupidity! Can't go there when you are in transit, without going through immigration. But you are so welcome to buy anything Else."
"Greetings everyone, I am amaze by how well Jurong Bird Park employee treat me and my family. Their customer service is very pleasant as there they approach us with a happy bright smile. Following that, the employee tell us information and even gives us a fun fact of a place in Jurong Bird park. i really love their customer service. To gives us a end , Jurong bird park even gives us a great Fewell as we will not be there frequently. The employee even treat us like we are their king. :) all is great exprience"
"A nostalgic trip back to the bird park to experience it before they shifts to Mandai. Jurong used to be very happening with crocodile farm and Tang Dynasty. World class bird park with entertaining shows. Must visit the wings of Asia and the Philippines eagle. Highly recommended for all Singaporeans to visit before they move away. Don't forget to say hello to the ""retired"" birds. Especially Big John. He is legend!"
"We enjoyed the visit after many years since we last visited.The birds in the various zones are well managed and taken care of. We were able to walk leisurely and view the different types of species.The safe distancing measures were helpful and effective, and the staff ensured the rules were able to control the crowd.We are thankful for the prices during this 50th anniversary as it felt worth it for us, as long if you want to visit the zones/shows that you are interested in."
"Enjoyed myself during this visit, must have been close to 30 years since my last visit. Coincide with the 50 years anniversary where entrance fee is $2.50. Also probably the last time to visit the Jurong Bird Park before it is being relocated to the Mandai area, the landscape and definitely brought back countless memories.. the bird shows are still good, more of a walk down the memory lane and to see the new attractions within.. definitely worth bringing the family to visit again."
"Pay $2.5 promotion price for the 50th year anniversary celebration. The bird park is one of the most famous tourist attractions in Singapore.The park is not big, but has a bit uphill and downhill, suggest to purchase the tram ticket for moving around the park.There are a few main attraction have to charge extra $2.5 per entry during the $2.5 promotional period, but the total price still cheaper than the original price.The bird collection is a lot in the park, really have to spend one full day if you would like to have a look through all the birds there and watch the shows.There are a few small restaurants with the main attractions, but not many seats for those restaurants, which is a problem there in the park."
"This is a very clean and well-maintained park. Check out this place if you have never visited here before or even if you have, do revisit before it makes its move to Mandai!"
bring childen study birds .my two kids very like bird and Learn about the species of birds and their colors
"Decided to visit before this park relocates to Mandai in the next few years. I believe this attraction is often overlooked by many in favour for the zoo and river/night safaris. I loved my visit here. Also signed up for the 'birds eye tour', a behind-the-scenes tour that allowed me to get up close with a hornbill, owl, hawk and 18-day old cockatiel and talk to their keepers. It was a real eye-opener and interactive experience. Strongly recommend watching their shows and attending the feeding sessions as well."
"I've been to Jurong Bird park many times in fact I couldn't remember. Whenever I have friends and families visiting me or with my friend here in SG or just by myself this is one of my go to favorite destinations. Built in 1971 it was first located in Jurong Hills then moved to Mandai Lake in 2020, in the Western part of Singapore with an area of 20 Hectares and shelters about 12,000 animals this is one of the world's best and most beautiful bird parks. Exhibits in the park include the Waterfall Aviary, with one of the world's tallest man made waterfalls at 30 meters nestled in the middle of a tropical like forest with streams and real life suspension bridge that gives you a panoramic view of the falls. The Aviary mainly focus on African birds which are free flying within the Aviary. The Dinosaur descendants houses large extant and flightless birds that include Crane, Ostriches, Cassowary to name a few. Wings of Asia houses about 200 species of Southeast Asian birds with different aviaries. Lorry Loft is the world's largest walk-in aviary at 9 stories high that house over 1000 lorries. Penguin coast houses the King penguin, African, Humboldt penguins etc, which lived in Indoor climate controlled den suitable for Penguins. Pelican cove is a beautiful man made lake that houses different species of Pelicans. There is a board walk also where visitors can view them closely. There are there different types of Flamingo Pool and Lake that houses Greater and Lesser Flamingos as well as the Caribbean Flamingo. And finally the Birds of Prey, where the mighty raptors are based including vultures, hawks and the critically endangered Philippine Eagles, one of the world's largest Eagles and there are two of them located here, which just opened this year. I personally visited this July to witness and support these Amazing birds of prey for the continued sustainability of their species. During my visit the cost of membership is at 39 dollars and gives me a year of membership privilege and free access which is very much worth the price and you're also supporting the birds in captivity inside. Other attractions in the park include shows like King of the Skies (Birds of Prey) and High Flyers (Different birds species). There are plenty of eateries and vending machines inside including drinking water fountain. Shops are available upon exit for your perfect memorabilia and souvenirs. The park itself is very well managed, maintained, clean and to sum it up - very beautiful. Finally, despite me visiting this park a lot of times, each time I go here it still feels my first time - always excited, surprised and delighted. I will surely be back for more :=)"
Jurong is the best bird park. I never really knew that there are so many species of birds.Like it is so perfectly managed and you also have an opportunity to feed parrots also.
"Jurong Bird Park is on the move. From 2020, the Zoo will move to a new venue. The Singaporeans are practical people. If one Zoo is no longer fit for purpose, get a new Zoo! The Bird Park is a ""must see"" in Singapore, and has been since it opened in 1971. I first saw the Zoo not long fter it opened. I was amazed by the falcony, and to this day this is the largest bird show in the world. Transfering 5,000 birds, comprising more than 400 species, will take three months. As they say, the show must go on, and it will."
This place really great place to see all species of birds. Many birds were kept in free space and few ones were captivated but kept in a spacious area. This place is so huge it take almost half day to explore every area.
"A huge park full of colourful birds. You can interacts with the parrots and not only they have birds, but also fishes and bugs too."
This is just a delight to be able to walk through the aviaries amounts the birds who clearly have no fear of humans. The shows are also worth seeing - a must see attraction.
"We visited this place in March 2020, it was deserted because of virus saga. Trans, bird shows were closed, however, it did not stop my husband and I from having an excellent time there.There were many species of birds there. Waterfall is beautiful. Workers and staff were very friendly. We felt like we own the whole park.In fact, the quietness gives us a chance to slowly walk through all the displays without any disturbances.I think the Bird Park is totally underrated.It will be re-located to another part of the island in due course, so, please visit it if you still can.. it's got an old charm to it."
Absolutely loved this park. Had a great variety of birds and the exhibits were a good size for each species. The overall layout of the park was easy to get around as well. Very clean and tidy. Highly recommend!
"We caught the MRT and then a bus, didnt take very long. take your singapore airlines boarding pass with you and get a discount. The bird park is not a big as the zoo so you can do in about 2 hours. Water bottle filling stations are everywhere. get there before 10am to see the first bird show."
"As a family, we love birds of every kind. I guess our feathered friends know it, because year after year the red-cheeked, red-vented, crested bulbuls we get in South India, have nested in our apartment balcony and successfully raised a family of three fledglings every time. Obviously when in Singapore, a visit to Jurong Bird Park would be high on our list.We did not expect to be so overwhelmed. Such beauty, such colour, such character, such birdsong...it was like Heaven on Earth! The enclosures give visitors a most thorough viewing of the different kinds of birds and we were fortunate enough to be in time for a charming display in one of the many ""amphitheatres"" in the park after which we had the opportunity to be photographed with them. In one of the enclosures we walked ""in the treetops"" while birds sang and chattered alongside us, completely unafraid. I felt awe and humility in the presence of such unique, beautiful, and intelligent creatures. It was difficult to get away although we had spent five hours in the park."
"The high flyers show was one of the highlights for us, such an interesting, funny and informative session, we thoroughly enjoyed it, The other particular highlight, was feeding the parrots nectar although the little beggars can bite hard!! A well laid out and beautifully kept park with lots of keepers to give information of various birds. Would visit again"
"One of the best place to see different kind of birds from allover the world.... Don't miss the bird show, it was one of the best part of the park where you could actually be a part of the show... Overall it was a great experience would love to visit again..."
"Great walk in the park. Go early, spray on insect repellent. A private tour is definitely worth it. Staff are very friendly and helpful."
If you are in Singapore then don't miss this attraction and also don't miss the shows they counduct at specific time. all information you will get it on website and at bird park you will get the map and show timing details. it will take minimum 5hours. indian food at enterenc gate was superb. other experiences you have to do by your own eyes.
"We very much enjoyed the wonderful bird park, and the extraordinary variety of birds that we were able to view and experience. The aviary was the most impressive, but many of the other exhibits were almost equally impressive. The pink flamingos were spectacular.The exhibition areas were beautifully designed, and well laid out, with a good guide map to the various areas. The tram ride is worth the S$5 to help get around.We would thoroughly recommend the park for any visitor to Singapore."
"Beautifully landscaped park with '3400 birds across 400 species.' Of course we didn't see them all, but the variety we did see was amazing'from king penguins to toucans to giant hornbills to vultures, to tiny lorikeets and everything in between. There were many large, open-air enclosures where you could interact directly with the birds. The Lory Loft, for example, even sold cups of nectar to feed the birds, which encouraged them to come right up close. Great experience for adults and children alike."
"It was a very good experience to see a lot of colorful birds and also nice plants, also the shows were amazing. You also get the chance to feed some parrots. You only need some hours to walk around the park. Also a small tram goes around and helps you to get from point A to point B, if you pay a little extra. There are of course several food options available in the park. On a hot summer day make sure to carry enough water with you. It is also possible to refill your bottle at the beginning of the park. Its really recommended to everyone!"
"Beautifully laid out this took us over 6 hours and we did not get to every area. We did the initial loop to get oriented then started to visit areas and some displays. There may be some purists who say birds should never be kept confined, but I think you have to accept that there are circumstances that require it and the feeling is that all are well looked after and cared for. re is no sense of exploitation anywhere when we visited. Memories are too many to list, but having 5 Loriets on me at one time has to be among to tops......"
"Varieties of birds on displays. Lots of shows running side by side like eagle show, pelican show, etc. Maps available at entrance. Tram rides also available as the place is vast. Must visit for all bird lovers. For us it took 3.5 hours to complete the park."
"Took a bus to reach the park. This is a half a day affair, it you stay for the shows. Amazing variety of birds, and the show was super cool. My kid got to get up and close with the birds after the show, was really excited."
"Clean, friendly & helpful staffs. Enjoyed our visit there. The toilets were accessible, nursing friendly rooms available."
This is a very big bird park. There are many lovely bird are free to fly here and don't bother us as visitors. We can also see cute penguins.
"We did the night safari tram ride and it's just as well we got there early and took one of the early trams as by the end of the nearly 1 hour ride, it was completely dark and hard to see anything. Most of the ride was really good, one or two of the creatures couldn't be seen even in the daylight, but that's animals for you - hide when we want to look! If you really want to see everything, go earlier and walk around yourself. I believe there is a hop-on/hop off tram I don't know what time it starts and it is considerably dearer than the full-circle tram ride, which doesn't start till 7.30pm (but get there early and book, then wait in the queue)."
Its a very good park with a lot of variety of birds.It takes 1 full day to cover the park. worth seeing
"An amazing places with so so many species of birds.The birds are very well cared for indeed. Very clean feeding containers with high quality food. They even had snow for the penguins . The staff were very knowledgable and work hard for conservation.There is a bus with many stops throughout the park a great asset for the less able. Souvenirs, drinks and snacks are much better priced than here in the UK.We travelled there using the MRT and local bus which was very easy to do"
It is superb and marvellous. Take a ram and drop at each station and see it thoroughly. There are lot of shows which is again worth seeing. It will take approximately 4to 5 to see the whole thing hence make your time available. It is also around 16 kms from the city hence you need a car etc for dropping and picking up .must visit place as so many birds can never be seen at one place.
This place is fantastic for all ages. They have amazing bird shows that must not be missed. You can spend a whole day here very easily. We took a taxi which was about $20SG but public transport is probably available. We also found out that they are building a whole new bird park near the zoo with new aviaries that will allow the birds more space. I can't wait to go back to see this when it is completed.
You must use the subway and bus to conme here! There're many kinds of bird. The feeling like that we're in the forest. My little kid really liked it.
It is a ways out to see Juron in the west ... rumour from the cabbie (we took the MRT then a cab ) is it is to be moved closer to the Singapore Zoo rather than birds to the west and the zoo to the north . The walk through sections are very nice go early and get in to the feeding satins to see the birds close up .. The hornbills can be difficult to see as the mesh is tight but are impressive. I saw 2 species in the wild in Malaysia but too see the Rhino Horbill close was good. it is good spot
"We weren't sure about travelling so long to the bird park but we're glad we did.It was well worth it. We started on the hop on hop off tram but ended up walking around. Lots of beautiful birds and the shows were fun. The highlight was feeding the lorikeets and parrots with nectar as they land on your head, shoulders and arms to drink.Well worth the visit!"
"I am not really a bird person like other members of my family but this bird park was exceptional with so many unusual species I had never seen before. The park is open every day of the year and about 20 minutes from Marina Bay. We took a grab (like uber) and it was under $10USD. A favorite area was the Wings of Asia where a person can observe the birds in their natural habitat up close. In the park make sure to see the unusual: Edward's pheasant, Philippine eagle and the Mindanao bleeding heart. A person of any age could easily spend a day here with bird shows, feeding the birds and wildlife tours."
"One of the finest bird parks in the world,it is a huge site with birds in huge cages and walk in avairy. You can get close to birds like parrots that feed off your hands.the exotic can be found in the Bird of Paradise enclosure."
Really good bird park with lots of good experiences. Well laid out and even though there was a bit of rain around the day we visited it was all ok. Loved the wings of Asia area where you can walk amongst the birds.
"Worth the money spent on taxi and entrance. The birds were spectacular. The cockatoos came in so close that one can admire their beautiful colours. The gardens were so well laid and managed. Even out here you could feel a world class service that Singapore offers, unmatched by any country.."
"A very big park. If you end up watching the shows then you can easily spend a big part of your day here. We spent around 6 hours and could have spent more had it not been raining. Unfortunately, one of their shows was cancelled due to the rain. You get to see so many species of birds and get to know about them. A very informative place for kids and adults alike. One of the best things to do in Singapore."
Birds are all around you. They are so cute that I don't want to leave! There is a lot of birds and the bird show is brilliant!
"Clean and well organised bird park with interesting shows. Only need a couple of hrs to view. After having seen zoos before, this was different to observe birds in captivity and conservation efforts"
"If you are visiting Singapore, it's a must try place to visit. If you have time visit the place by walking. There is also Shuttle service available. One of the biggest highlight is the Waterfall..."
"It's a beautiful experience, regardless of the weather (unless its pouring, when the best thing you can do is brood along with the birds).The tram ride is not required, as the park is smaller than the zoo and is fine to cover by foot. Sometimes it does get confusing but you won't get lost. Expect to spend an entire day here because it's quite far from the city center.We ate at the Indian restaurant outside and it's great value for money. Definitely recommended, especially if you have little kids."
"This attraction is great for all ages. So many different varieties of birds, huge free flight avairy with a cafe inside. The best bird shows I have ever seen (and Ive seen a few). Kids can learn a great deal too. A very clean and well run park. Makes a great day out, well worth a visit."
"If you're interested in birds, don't miss out on a visit to Jurong Bird Park whilst in Singapore. An extensive collection with the highlight perhaps being the walk-in aviaries. Identification of individual species could be improved in some cases, but perhaps this will be rectified when the move of the entire collection to Singapore Zoo premises is completed..."
"A must-see tourist attraction! I have been on a solo visit to this place in my first week in Singapore. I was amazed by the live shows of the parrots, they did all sorts of tricks. All the different flamingo types are amazing, but I mostly enjoyed the Bird aviary, where birds can fly freely, and you can get really close to them at the feeding houses. There is a wonderful fountain in the aviary. Also, it was interesting to see the ""Hatchery"". A very pleasant experience would recommend visiting at least once."
"An amazing place, highly recommended for tourists. There are daily shows which showcase vultures and parrots and penguin feeding at certain times of the day. You can hand feed parakeets syrup, there is plenty to see. The park is huge but there is a tram service/tour if you dont feel like walking around the entire park. Due to time constraints i only spent half the day there but do allow for a full day to see all the shows."
"Visited two times. This was my most favorite thing in Singapore. The variety of birds is huge. Flamingos look gorgeous. Penguins look fine too. Don't miss out on the parrots area. Hawk show was OK but you can afford to miss it. But the other one (I think Flyer's show, or something) was very nice. Don't go there when it's raining. Birds tend to take shelter."
"You need most of the day to enjoy the experience. Beautiful birds of all different shapes and colour, lots of shows to see and enjoy. Food is reaonably priced and enjoy the many different photos that you will be able to take and share."
We had A fabulous time here..so educational. The birds looked really healthy the surroundings are beautiful along with the waterfall. Thank heavens for the train.
"Visiting during the day approximately 6-8 hours required. Shows are very engaging and brilliantly displayed, park is a pleasant place for anyone visiting Singapore."
"We have been to Singapore several times but never visited the Juron Bird Park. And IT IS a visit not be misssed! We spent several hours there enjoying all the birds, their superb colours and took many many photos."
"I was skeptical at first to visit a bird park. However i was wrong. The park size which is smaller than the Singapore zoo, make it manageable by half a day. The show is a must. The birds was well trained. There is also a water park and playground for kids to play around. The water dispensers are everywhere. The tram was convenient. The parking was ample. It is a good experience for our family"
"I enjoyed a lot the stay on the Park, especially because I could participate in the bird's show. I am surprised positively that the organizator tried to provide nice show with some educational content."
"A real must see place if you like birds. Make sure you go to 'Lory Loft' and get some bird food, they will fly to you and land on you. My toddler absolutely loved it. Both shows were good and a great way to spend a few hours."
"Jurong Bird Park is well worth a visit, especially if you enjoy birds and wildlife! The park is well organised, spacious and not too crowded (even on a weekend). Exhibits were thoughtfully crafted, birds have plenty of space and company, and the shows were well presented and captivated the imagination.Completely recommend a visit!"
"Located in sylvan settings it was a delight for young and adults alike. What was surprising that the birds were trained to dance, fly and delight the audience in an unbelievable way."
"I just LOVE this park, I was so happy to see the pair of Shoebill Storks, such amazing birds. The Flamingo family never disappoint, just so elegant and colourful wow! I was a little shocked to see penguin swimming around in Singapore's heat and humidity only to learn that they are from the Galapagos Islands and can withstand temperatures of up to 40 degrees, you learn something new everyday."
A well run bird park. A tram runs around the park so it is easy to get around . Good information at each section. Kept clean. Areas to purchase and feed the birds. A small cafe.
"Yesterday (21.10.2019) I visited Jurong Bird park with 6 of my family members, unfortunately I forgot the redeemed tickets for the park at the hotel itself. Got to know that only after reaching the park. We contacted Ms.Priya (Ticketing in charge) of jurong bird park and told our concern. She immediately discussed the issue with the official there and allowed all of us to enter the park, and asked us to send tickets through WhatsApp later when we reach the hotel. That was a great help for us, as kids were very eager to see the birds and we would've been really disappointed if we had missed the bird park. Had she not acted spontaneously with concern for us we would have missed the wonderful bird park. We all enjoyed both the shows and happen to see many new species of birds. It was the most memorable day.Thanks to Priya madam & the entire team."
this is my second time to visit the bird park tagging along with me some friends and relatives. I just want them to see how these birds are so beautiful and the can also perform as their mentor tells them. Its so entertaining to watch them.
Awesome experience at Jurong bird park. Lots of lovely birds. The bird shows are really good. Don't miss the shows. You can walk around and see the birds or take the tram.
"Excellent place to go. Very interesting and beautiful birds. One sees birds that are not common. Birds are well taken care of. There is a section where you can feed them and they come to you to eat and stand on your hands, or arms. The birds are very colorful. The bird park is clean and well organized. Don't miss it."
"Wow, what a place to watch all the colorful and beautiful birds. Vulture and Eagle show, birds show was amazing. My children enjoyed it immensely. Bird feeding was yet again a different experience."
This is a great day out.We got on the MRT to Boon Lay then the number 194 bus which dropped us off outside.When buying tickets purchase the tram pass. There are some steep inclines to walk up.Make sure you get the timing of the shows. These were really good. I recommended the 3pm high flyer show.The feeding of the pelicans is good too.Add this to your list of the must things to do in Singapore
It is a wonderful & enchanting bird park. There is a battery operated car at the entrance for a quick look at the various birds & the landscape and the lake etc for those in a hurry & cannot walk like old people & children. There is a water Park for children who enjoy it the most. Better you take a swim dress or you can buy one there in the shops inside. There are beautiful birds like flamingos at the entrance & various other rare birds also.The Chimpanzees hopping on the tree brances is most enjoyed by both children & adults alike. There are few eateries also inside for the hungry stomachs. You can take photos also at the entrance with big colourful birds by professional photographers & ofcourse with some fees.On the whole it is a most enjoyable & memorable visit for the whole family & must see visit for the tourists. The cleanliness & tidiness of the attraction inspite of so many visitors is amazing and kudos to the staff there.
Fantastic place to visit. This was my fourth / fifth visit over a period of 24 years. An amazing place to get to know about birds. You also get an opportunity to feed the birds in the aviary and get a chance to look at them close up.Wonderfully laid out planned place with a special enclosures for different birds like the Flamingos and Hornbills. We visited on a cloudy day and were faced with rain in the second half of our visit. Must plan to look at all the shows. You will need a full day for your visit if you want to take the complete experience and view everything properly and in detail.It's a very educative place and a lot of information is available.They do a lot of breeding on the endangered species.AMAZING EXPERIENCE !!!!
What a fun thing to send home to your family and friends. The birds are beautiful and the so colorful your visit will be a once in a lifetime experience to remember
It's an amazing place where they have created near perfect environment for birds. You would need whole day to explore the park properly. There's a huge man made waterfall as well. Park has trails to explore by foot as well as tram every 10 minutes hitch stops at 3 stations.Only area of improvement is the penguin bay - the cold one. It was dimly lit and stains on the glass made it hard to observe the penguins.
"not s packed as the Singapore Zoo, we had a great time there. this is a good place for family with young children. don't miss the breeding and research centre, very educational"
"Singapore is always changing so it's no surprise that the venerable Jurong Bird Park is on the move. It will relocate in 2020. Visitors never tire of seeing the raptor show and the displays of falcony. I've seen it several times. The Jurong Bird Park is one of the world's largest bird zoos, there's lots of birds to see. It's a must see if you have a spare day. in Singapore. The bird park is a bit out of central Singapore, but everything is relative, Singapore is a small island, and the Furong Bird Park is one the island's best lloved attractions."
The Bird Park was absolutely awesome. I spent about 5 hrs here going backwards and forwards on the open tram so that I didn't miss anything.
"We celebrated my daughters 11th birthday at the BirdPark and it was the best Birthday Party she has ever had. We saw the highflier show and she got to volunteer, we had arranged for a behind the scenes tour with was beyond our expectations with close encounters with Hornbills, Birds of Prey and at the hatchery and research centre. Everyone was very knowledgable and the children loved it and learned a lot. We ended with lunch with the Parrots. All in all a lovely day. Thank you to our wonderful guide Ms Inara and to everyone else who made our daughter feel special."
"Loved the park. But as the title suggests, it was all about the shoebills. Such beautiful yet scary animals and they aren't shy so I was able to really spend some time enjoying their presence.Other highlights include the hornbill cancer survivor with an artificial bill and the pigeon/dove section."
"The vegetation is beautiful, but what will happen to the trees and vegetation when it moves to another site. I have read that it will be turned into an industrial site. Because of the vegetation Jurong is exquisite. The carers are great but the exhibit near the entrance with a rather large grey rare bird had dead fish to ear. Maybe they should have a aerated pond with frequently stocked Live fish instead of dead fish. Water seemed to be scarce in enclosures."
"Among the sights was a weaning center for little birds - so you can observe the type of care the staff gives to the birds. And there are so many birds -- countless flamingoes in ponds, for example. Strolling through the park is a pleasure, and there is always something to see. The birds are happy and friendly. There's a waterfall, too. Everything was delightful."
"We got there around 10am and spent about 7 hours. Many types of bird species there as we were expected. Take note of the feeding time and the live shows at 3pm and 4pm. For bird lovers, you won't be disappointed."
"A regular visitor at the Jurong Bird Park, I've always enjoyed all the shows which often have fresh content. New species of birds on display. You might even see an iguana or two.My favourite is the Toucan/Hornbill section. But do get behind the aviaries where the birds are hiding. There a slope for easy access at the extreme left facing the aviaries.Really liked the updates on the status of the birds on their description boards so that we do not become unwitting supporters of illegal trade. For example, I did not know that Grey Parrots are now considered endangered. TTIf you plan to stay until the park closes at 6pm, and catch bus service 194 to Boon Lay MRT, take the bus from the side of the park. If you cross the road to the opposite bus stop, you will probably miss a few buses as they will be too crowded to board."
"The park is very well laid out and birds pretty and exotic although seeing penguins in the tropics is a tad bizarre. Guided tours are available but park mostly seems to attract families and maids having a picnic. There's also a small water park very popular with kids. At present, there's free entry for Singapore citizens and permanent residents so there was a two hour queue when we arrived. To skip that, we were advised to buy online and use e-ticket to enter without any delay."
Have been a number of times over the years from the Early 80'S to the present. Gets better every time. Great place to bring children. It's a well laid out park with some very interesting shows throughout the day.
We visited the bird park as a couple. There is lots to offer everyone with plenty of birds to see. They have shows on daily to talk about the birds which are mainly morning and afternoon times. Our favourite was the shoebills but there is also far more on show. There are some domesticated birds flying around freely in the park as well as the odd lemur and cameleon in the trees. There's an audio train in English if you don't feel like walking. You can feed the Lori's for a small fee. Overall it's a great place to visit and learn about animals.
"Nice for kids and kids at heart, all the shows are beautiful. Highly recommended for everyone. Will going back again."
This bird park hosts different shows which are unique. The all stars show and the show which displays the hawks and eagles was a very different experience. you can feed some of the birds here.
"Fairly close to Nanyang Technological University, so I went to check it out. They had so many species of birds and lots of different exhibits. This park definitely exceeded my expectations. I loved the Waterfall Aviary and the Lory Lofts. I thought the visit was worth the price of admission. They had penguins, toucans, parrots, flamingos and many birds I've never seen before. It would be great for families with children."
"Jurong Bird Park is one of the 4 parks available on the good-value multi-park tickets. While the Zoo and the River Safari were underwhelming, the Bird Park never fails to impress. It's just a fun place to go for all age groups and the variety of species on show is sizeable. And unlike the larger animals at the Zoo, birds tend to be active all day. The layout of the park is user-friendly with one long perimeter loop making all enclosures easy to navigate. There is the bird staple where you can have parrots sit on you while you feed them. There is a shuttle cart to take you around if you don't wish to walk and there is a water park for the kids to splash around in. The food options are typically expensive and not particularly high quality. This is a half day excursion."
"An amazing day of avian appreciation. From lorikeets and parrots, then flamingos and pelicans. The exotica of hornbills and toucans. Birds of prey. Then the kaleidoscope of giant macaws in flight. JUST DO IT!"
"Jurong Bard Park (JBP) is an unique bird park covering 49 acres of land with over 200 species of bird of which most of the birds are from South Asia. JBP has many sections which one traveler can see through extensive walks. The other options is by internal tram ride. Several pairs of tramps are moving around at a regular interval from a place closed to the main entry. Tramp tickets are included with the entry tickets and so it is better to use tramps which touches three stations, Lory Loft, Waterfall Aviary, and Parrot Paradise. On the other side of the Parrot Paradise there is a huge open space of variety of storks.Penguin Coast is at the right side of the entry which is truly an artificially created amazing environment of penguins. This is certainly attractive for kids but travelers of all age enjoy watching their activities, especially interaction between mothers and young penguins.After that we took the tram ride to Lory Loft. Lory is a kind of parrot and Loft is arguably the largest open cage of the world housed almost 1,000 lories. Lories are so colorful that sometimes they look like rainbow.From Lory Loft we moved to Waterfall Aviary where again we observed few colorful bird species and an artificial waterfall. Here there is a small drinks and snacks shop with open sitting space where travelers can take rest, have some food, refill drinking water in the bottle, and also go to restroom.Next is Parrot Paradise, which literally is a paradise of parrots. The best in this station is of course Blue Macaw. On the other side of this station traveler can spend some time watching activities of thousands of storks of different species. It was truly worth to spend some time over there and walk instead of taking the tram to go back to the original starting point.Jurong Bird Park is certainly an excellent park where traveler of any age will enjoy spending few hours with birds of different species and enjoy cool time."
"Love the park, has a little something for everyone. The shows for older kids and adults. The wonderful water play area for all ages.Highlight are the walk in bird cages for close interaction.Alot to see and will take up the whole day if you're keen to see everything"
"Really enjoyed our visit to the bird park, lots to see and do! The shows were entertaining. Loved the flamingoes."
"Lovely place for a stroll in all the greenery to see all the different birds. Just wish the cages/avaries were bigger for better flight for the birds, after all, that's what they do. However, they are obviously well looked after. Enjoyed the shows and not crowded. I believe it is closing and moving to the Singapore Zoo."
"We spent most of a day here. So much to see. Well worth seeing. Must go to the the shows including the Raptor show, very good"
What a beautiful sanctuary full of amazing birdlife. We were fortunate that upon arrival we were just in time for one of the bird shows.My daughter was chosen from the audience to hold onto a huge ring for the birds to fly through....what an amazing experience for her!! We also got to have photos with the Flamingos after the show. A must to visit when in Singapore!
Very well maintained bird park. Lots of rare bird species. Time your visit well so that you don't miss the feeding and bird shows. You can use the tram but I don't think it's required as it can be covered on foot if you have time/energy. Kids will certainly love the place. Don't miss the waterfall aviary. Buy park hopper tickets if you are visiting the other 3 parks as well as it is pretty cheap compared to individual tickets.
"A Lifetime Experience, All in Singapore should make sure they visit Jurong Bird Park at least once in their life."
I have visited Jurong Bird Park long back in 1998 after 20 years now it seems like completely change. For thouse who like and love birds and also for the kids specially its a beat place to visit.
Nature lovers will be mesmerised and thrilled with the many species of birds housed in Jurong Bird Park. A great stroll to see the beautiful array of birds chirping in a huge span area. Not to be missed!
"Went to the Bird Park with my two kids (ages 8 & 10) and we all loved it. Without trying to repeat what many other reviewers have said, here are a few tips for maximizing your experience:Go early in the day to avoid the heat and larger crowds.Attend all the shows that you can, they are free, educational, and very entertaining.If you have young kids (under 10), bring swimsuits so they can use the wet playground.If you are in good health and do not have very young kids, a tram ticket is not necessary. The park is not huge and is very walkable.Bring a picnic, outside food is allowed, and the food options in the park are just ok."
"We all enjoyed ourselves here. We saw both of the shows, and fed the Lorries. The kids spent an hour in the wet area. It was very hot and sunny. I was glad we arrived at opening. It also gave us an hour before the huge crowds arrived. There were no taxis when it was time to leave which was frustrating."
"Bird Park is a little bit far from the city but it is a nice natural place to visit. I recommend visiting early morning. For me, I visited the bird park first and I went to Singapore Zoo from Bird park by taking a Taxi (Grab). It lasts only about 20-30 minutes. One unforgettable memory is that I lost my wallet at the taxi stand of Bird Park. I knew losing when I arrived at Zoo. I come back to Bird Park and asked the staff of customer membership counter. They said my wallet was kept at the counter because someone found my wallet and gave it to the counter. OMG... I was so happy.Jurong bird park is a nice place and there are many species of bird there. You can take the photo with colorful birds."
"Don't miss this for anything, and better to reach by 9:30 am so you can buy the tickets and then head to the Kings of Prey show at 10 am and then roam around a little and go for the 11 am show called High Flyers. in both this shows you end up seeing most of the birds in the bird park."
"We spent a whole day here, the most beautiful bird park that I have ever visited. Bird paradise. We booked to have lunch with the Parakeets and Cockatoos. The birds are fantastic, the cockatoo named Picasso actually painted a picture. All the birds well looked after . There is also an opportunity to handle the birds. All the bird shows well worth seeing. Would visit again."
The bird show at Amphitheater was amazing! A good 4 hours atleast to explore the entire park. Meet the Flamingos at the pool for sure !
One of the most beautiful bird parks. Well organised. The birds shows they have are fantastic. One may find it better than the Singapore zoo. It is a bit far from the city but worth a visit. Ideally you require a day to really enjoy the place
No getting away from the heat at these outdoor attractions in Singapore but this park sure is worth the sweat. The waterfall atrium is just fabulous and I could have spent the entire afternoon in there. The show on the stage was thoroughly entertaining too.
"Just something for everyone (Excpet those who are damn hungry and can't appreciate beauty of a bird, but can only eat one)"
"The jurong bird park is well maintained and a pleasure to visit. We spent a full day and despite the rains making it not possible to have some events, we were happily tired by the variety of captivating birds we encountered throughout. The waterfall was a sight to behold."
It has been almost 15 years since I last visited the Bird Park. It still amazes me with the shows and new theme of Singing Forest. It won't be long to my next visit.
My friends were visiting from the USA and I was very proud to show them the bird park. They were very impressed with our bird collection as well as how nice the entire experience was
"Would dare say Jurong Bird Park is world class. Definitely schedule a visit if you're a bird lover. Make time for at least a half day, because it's far from town and airport. Wear comfy clothes and bring an umbrella because it will either be a hot and/or wet day.Download a rideshare app like Grab or Gojek as they are probably the best way to get around without paying too much."
We had a fantastic moment in park.If can't book a tram and enjoy the view.Kids will enjoy a lot in the water park and dont forget to take clothes for them. You can also play if you are interested.
"A great family and everyone's day out to experience unique and interesting birds from Asia, etc. Interesting at every turn. Don't miss this."
The Jurong Bird Park is a beautiful bird park with a wide variety of birds and different types of bird shows.The tram ride inside the bird park is excellent as it takes you around the park and stops at the stations within the park so you can get down and click photos. It is a must visit attraction and it is value for money.
during the december school holidays i took some kids to this attraction and all the kids really enjoyed the varieties of birds.
"Wonderful Bird Park. Small, but with an excellent collection of birds. Excellent conditions for birds. Particularly admired collection of species of Macaw parrots. On the tracks of the parks you can meet leisurely iguanas. Be sure to visit this wonderful park!"
I go to Singapore quite often because it's a beautiful and cheap holiday. Over all the years I have been to many places there and the best ones I go back to everytime the bird park is one of them. It is so beautiful and colourful my favorite place is in the big aviary with the large waterfall. Take lots of water as it gets hot and be prepared the penguin area smell cos of the fish. Have fun I do.
"Being from Tasmania, I dont get to see this range of birds ever, so this park for me was brilliant. The bird shows were amazing and I really appreciated the conservation message that was expressed as part of each bird show.We had 6 hours and that was not enough time. I'll visit again next time I am here."
"For those travelers who have been to other Bird Parks...dont just go by the name. Its a treat to visit this park.Very meticulously planned.Buy tickets for Jurong park with tram ride.There are 4-5 small blocks to be visited in the park. The tram has 4 stops and it takes you around. You can get down at any stop of your interest and visit that area.Recommended method.First sit in the tram and resist your temptation to get down at every stop.See all the stops in one circuit and then get down to doing each segment one by one.One section has a mini splash park for kids. Owing to the weather of Singapore, the kids are giong to love this.....but be careful....get into it only if you have a full day for the Park, else avoid it.Recommended to start the tour in the morning and definitely dont miss the BIRD SHOW at the AMPHITHEATER. 11:00 & 3;00 pm everyday.Worth a visit for all age groups.Has a limited variety of restaurants also. For Indians, soth indian cuisine available in a restaurant just outside the park."
"We had a lovely day here with our 4 year old. Beautiful aviaries, an opportunity to engage with some of the birds, and nice places to eat lunch. The shuttle tram service was a great option when little legs got tired. Tons of places to refill water bottles as you walk around.I understand the bird park is moving next to the zoo in a couple of years. I hope the design will be in keeping with its current location. It was a nice place to walk around."
"I love the open and interactive concept of Singapore Bird Park. It the oldest wildlife park in Singapore, I have fond memories of my visits during school outings and I still enjoy the tranquil park 30 years later.The birds look really happy, chirping away loudly with plenty of room to expand their wings in the aviary with many storeys high netting and lots of real matured trees and flowering plants. The parakeets, cockatoos, lories are not shy to fly down close to humans.//In the mid- to late 1990s, staff realised they should not be making the birds do stunts that a human could do.The birds were then trained to showcase their natural abilities instead, such as swooping above the audience's heads or engaging in cheeky banter with the presenter.//"
We shared some very special moments in the Lory Loft. Those tiny birds wait to sip out of your cup. The beautiful colors and naughty nibling makes your heart want for more! Will definitely go back!
"Jurong Bird Park is an aviary and tourist attraction located on Jurong Hill. It is an excellent place for bird lovers. This well maintained park is the largest in Asia, and is home to over 5,000 birds, varying across 380 different species. It's a bird's paradise. They have interactive bird shows like 'Kings of the skies' showing prey animals and a Parrot show at the Pools Amphitheatre. Many more shows I guess which I couldn't explore. These shows are a must watch for all ages as they are very entertaining. You can roam around the park on a tram which halts at stations designated for specific bird enclosure. You will need a whole day to view all that the park has to offer. Get mesmerized with the beauty of the colourful birds and catch them in action in their natural habitat."
This is definitely one of the interesting place to visit when you are in Singapore. You won't regret.
"We really enjoyed our visit to the Park. Although not a very big area, the Park kept many species of birds. Situation on a slope, taking the tram would save some walking. We also had lunch with the Parrots. The quality of food was average, but it saved us time looking for restaurants. The show was interesting and specially suitable for children. The carpark was big enough to cater its visitors. The visit left us a good impression of the park."
"I traveled with my wife and 2 daughters. Earlier I thought what to see in bird park because most of the bird parks are common which I have seen in India. However this bird park is great and unique. Most admirable event is the bird show in this park which is really excellent. You can see all types of birds around the world including African penguin.Must see this park and shows again, if i visit Singapore next time."
A special kudos to the lovely water play area for the kids . Thoroughly enjoyed every visit to Jurong Bird Park
"What an amazing collection of birds. Jurong bird Park is one of best tourist attractions Singapore has. It takes you around 5 to 6 hours to see the park in complete sense. Live shows are the highlights of this park. If you are visiting Singapore, do not miss Jurong :)"
birds looks very healthy and natural environmental for the birds very cool place nice to visit with young children to learning for they studies and bird natures .
My daughter like watch parrow talking and play water over there. It was worth can apply 1 year membership which we can unlimited to visit and visit again. See you my lovely penguin and miss you very much.
"Lots of Shelter , clean and tidy .. staff are friendly and willing to offer help. My 1yr old kid enjoy very much and would like to go again"
"I allocated 2 hours to visit the bird park. In the end, I ended up staying 3, and it was not enough. It is a fascinating zoo containing many birds roaming either in very big cages, or entirely freely. It was amazing to see very rare birds completely in the open and not flying away anywhere. Apparently, they must be well treated and well fed. There was also an enclosed area within which many birds could roam freely. They were very tame and used to humans. You could watch some rare birds from up close. Highly recommended, and I look forward to going again, but next time, I will allow a whole day."
"This is an excellent place for bird lovers. Kids also enjoy penguin , eagle and parrot shows. You can explore park on mini tram without getting tired. The bird shows are great and very well presented and executed.Overall a must visit place in Singapore"
"Since we bought the 4 park annual membership, we, Darling Jac, Daughter Mel and I decided to take full advantage of the unlimited entry passes.We arrived at the bird park at 10 am, there weren't many people around and of those who were there, they were mostly tourist.Instead of planning a route like I always do... Jac ask why we needed to optimise the route.. 'we have complimentary passes for a year' let just... WALK. Boss has spoken. Without putting any more thought into it.. we just headed off. I think we started near the exit.We loved the enclosures, the smaller aviaries, I mean. Amazing.. had birds flying all around you as you walk through.. and there was one were you could even buy nectar water of some kind to feed the birds, which was really really nice.Walking around we spent the good park of 4 hours at the park, and we didn't even get to the waterfall aviary but we can come another time though.It was an awesome morning spent and since it was past 2.30 pm already, with stomachs growling, we decided to bid a fond adieu..."
"If you are interested in birds, it's a hole day experience - a huge and well maintained park with a lot of beautiful and exotic birds in nearly natural habitats! Amazing - and there is everything you need for your health :) How to get out easy to the park? - make it public! :) ""Take the East-West MRT line bound for Tuas Link, and alight at Boon Lay (EW27). From the Boon Lay bus interchange, take Bus No. 194, which will take you straight to Jurong Bird Park."" it's about 45 min. one way from the city"
"Our plan was to spend a morning at the bird park, but this changed shortly after our arrival as it became clear that we needed an entire day to fully enjoy the many and varied enclosures of this beautifully landscaped bird park. The tram enabled easy access around the park. It was well worth purchasing food for the birds at the Lory Loft and the Waterfall Aviary as this enhanced the experience. The High Flyers and Kings of the Skies shows were super. The breeding and research centre was most interesting. A fantastic day which even a thunderstorm could not ruin!"
"As a local, I only visit when there are visiting friends and they don't disappoint. The Entrance itself already features lots of eatery and well design garden and clean toilets, Upon entry, the penguin is just next to it on the right, where you can enjoy the cool aircondition away from the heat before or after the walk about.Walking further in is where you buy the tram ticket, which is for whole day ride, priced at SGD $5 for adult and $3 for children. As this place is not as crowded as zoo, the wait is quick, only 4 stops and every stops deserve a visit.Station 2 is where you can feed the birds, walk the hanging bridge, see horbill and their beautiful song, walking further down the road is the HUGE birds of prey, vultures and eagles.Station 3 is a man made waterfall, you come in contact with birds and lots of peacock roaming around you, just keep your kids hand to themselves please.Station 4 is where you visit the beautiful parrots, touted as the only one in the world, their call is loud and you may even get to hear them speak. walking further down is the flamingo valley, at least a hundred of them standing together.The timing not to miss are the feeding of birds of prey 10am and 4pm, feeding of penguin 10:30am and 3:30pm, bird show at 3 and 4pm, parrot show at 1pm. Sorry I am not too sure about the timing, please check with the park rangers at the park.So your kids can enjoy bird feeding and penguin feeding, don't miss visiting during the right hour.There are cafe and pizza place plus indian restaurants around the bird park, feel free to visit empty stomach and eat there, water fountain are plenty, so no risk of dehydration."
Undoubtedly the best I have seen n well maintained park; hats off for the caring of the birds and the show of birds is the best at 11 n 330pm..a lesson for all that we really need to care for the environment around us - give trees and nature a chance to survive in this competitive world ; Singapore has done well to send out a positive message with their upkeep n variety intact.
"Birds, birds and more birds! We were wondering if there would be something to see for more than 2 hours and we were so wrong! Once can spend a day entirely in this bird park. The park itself is spread across a huge area and is divided into bird exhibits from various parts of the world.The enclosures are not suffocating for the birds and in many of those enclosures, you can actually get inside to spot the birds, some of them friendly and some shy away. It is a fun exercise to do with young children.Birds not to miss- Penguins at the entrance (I felt a bit of pity to see that they had the least space as it requires cooling)- Lory Loft- Hornbills an Toucans- High flyers Show (at 11:00am in the Pools Amphitheater)- Waterfall Aviary - Definitely a Must See- Parrot ParadiseMake sure to take the Tram ticket as it can be convenient to go from one place to another at timesPlan to spend at least 4 hours (Including the show) and if you are with kids who are excited add some more time as there is also a play area"
"The last time I went to the Bird Park was around 25 years ago... back then, I was unimpressed with the place, preferring the Singapore Zoological Gardens (which I loved as a child then).25 years later, I'm back with a little bub of my own who loves birds, and I am very impressed with how much the park has changed since then. The bird shows were fun, with interactive segments. There's a water playground -- a favourite with children, so bring your swimsuits, sunblock & a change of clothes! You can actually walk around the whole park with some rest in between, but it can get very hot, so purchasing those tram tickets can help those with movement challenges / elderly / with babies. For parents, bring your strollers, the paths are generally wide & flat - although there's a few exhibits where you'll need to fold-up your stroller and carry it up some stairs and/or the paths are narrower and it's just easier to park your stroller outside & carry your kid around.Unless you're a bird fanatic, half a day will be adequate for covering all the exhibits. Pack your own lunches, there're sitting areas with tables where you can have a picnic, though bear in mind that many are unshaded. There're water refill stations all around, so bring your own water bottles."
Excellent place to spot the rarest & exquisite bird species at one place...blue macque...hornbills...penguines...the bird shows are excellent...be sure to catch them...take the tram ticket for easy conveyence inside the park...must visit in Singapore
"I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the park and the number of birds that were visible.Having been to other bird parks, you are often left searching the enclosure for 1 bird who happens to be sleeping or hiding.The flamingos were wonderful, so to the pelicans and then the hornbills.. just wonderful.Apart from those, there were so many other birds you could get up close in person to, especially the parrots with kids holding nectar.. oh yeah, some big kids too.The breeding and weaning display was great and it was cool that they had everything from penguins through to eagles.I thoroughly lovely visit."
"Our family booked the Jurong Bird Park Bird's Eye Tour (BET). It was an amazing, memorable and meaningful experience and all of us love it. We were brought around the park in a buggy by our friendly guide. We had up-close, hands-on experience with the various birds (feel, hold and feed hornbill, vultures, brahminy kites, owl and baby bird in breeding center). Our guide and the bird handlers are very friendly and we can feel the enthusiasm and passion that they have in caring for the birds. The birds at the Jurong Bird Park are very well taken care and very beautiful. We highly recommend the Bird's Eye Tour."
Fantastic place to visit! Shows are amazing. Great family day out. Highly recommend the tram if the heat gets too much!
"This was our 3rd and 4th Visit in as many as 3 years. I didn't think the kids would still love going there as much but they did and the biggest reason is the Penguins they love the Penguins Enclosure and the Penguin Feeding makes it unique and memorable for the kids. The park will be moving soon to Join the rest of the Wildlife Reserves but for now it's in Jurong, unfortunately there is no way to get here direct with the MRT but you can get a bus from the MRT we went from Boon Lay. The park is amazing clean well maintained the Birds are well looked after there is also a small Water Play area which the Kids loved. They also have some great shows The High Flyers club is a really fun show. If it's your first time visiting Singapore this is a must visit place."
"It's perfect place for kids visiting. Various kinds of birds, not only showing, also having some knowledge introduction. And the tour route is designed well, worth a half day visiting."
The day well spent with Birds. The Park is clean and nicely designed. The birds are well trained for the shows and the team is taking almost care of them.
The park was enjoyable and educational. Don't forget to visit the gift shop for interesting souvenirs
The place is huge but not confusing to explore. Elderlies and children can opt to ride the tram if they find walking too tiring.There are some sections where there are no barriers between you and the birds. Such a pleasant experience!
Jurong bird park vist was very informative and interesting tourist place. The shows performed during day share lot of information on birds lifecycle. Don't miss the hawk show and suggest to take the tram.
Totally worth visiting as the vibrant colourful birds will take you closer to nature. Ultimate beauty of Nature
I had been to Jurong Bird park last month and had wonderful time . You need 4-5 Hrs to complete itIts advisable first to take full ride tram and then hop off & on anywhere you want . Shows are not to be missed as they are very informative and goodRemember to carry a bottle for water and wear light clothes that suits the weather.travelled via MRT to nearest station and then took a bus ... it was very comfortableyou will need full day 6-7 hrs (incl travel time) at ease if you wish to cover entire park at leisurestaff is super helpful and friendly
"Jurong Bird park is worth visiting here is why -1. It has a lot of interesting Birds and ease is accessibility2. The Birds are housed in large enclosures and you get to feed them3. The park staff is very friendly and helpful4. The shows are good too and dont miss themCons:1. Veg food is a big problem here, however you can carry your own stuff2. Singapore weather is extremely humid making it hard to walk even few meters3. By taking the tram you cannot skip the walking part, you will still need to get off and do the walking to see all attractions.Typically it is a half day event with a bit of walking to do, if you got kids make sure you carry a stroller - the whole park is stroller friendly."
"Excellent to take photos of plenty of birds living in the enclosed forest. Big zoom lens is optional, i.e. normal zoom is enough :)"
Had a great time at the park with my Niece...and thoroughly enjoyed the show..which was information and entertainment at the same time...
Good experience. It takes almost 3 to 4 hours to complete the tour. I will suggest to view the penguines first and then take a tram ride to decide which part of the park you want to visit first. There are wide variety of birds in the park. Take your dslr camera if you have one to get close pictures of variety of birds. The shows here are also a not to be missed thing.
"Good educational trip for children. Start off w birds of prey show....vultures, hawks etc all at close range. Another show w parrots toucans, talking parrots etc is another enjoyable eye opener. Feeding birds w live worms at waterfall open avairy, and feeding lories w nectar n honey water in plastic cups are must do activities. Round off w kids at water playground (swimwear is a must)."
You can easily spend a day at the Jurong Bird Park. Many different species of birds. The colorful birds are amazing. At the walk in Aviary the birds would fly on my shoulders of people's arms. So friendly. I highly recommend this activity for visitors.
"WHILE IT WAS HOT, walking through the park was very interesting and fun to see all of the different types of birds. The park was spacious and if you like birds you definitely want to visit the Bird Park"
"Many Aviaries with many birds, different themes based on continents, Staff takes great care of birds, v informative. Really enjoyed and would love to visit again."
They have large variety of different birds in the park. They have different live shows showing in the morning and afternoon. The birds come from all parts of the world.
"An excellent experience, with all the residents obviously VERY well cared for! All the staff were very helpful and well informed, and a special mention for Nara, the Curator of their Jewels of the Jungle aviary - just the sort of dedicated wildlife expert the smaller topical Parrots love! Expect to spend a full day here, since there is a large area to cover and lots to see."
"During our stay, becoming a member was only a few dollars more than a day pass so we did that and actually came here twice. The staff are well trained, polite and helpful. The park itself is in top condition and the birds look healthy and well cared for. Within the argument about weather any animal should be kept in captivity there is the thought that by teaching people about a species they might take that knowledge away and the wild animals end up being treated better... lets hope that's true. A very enjoyable place to visit."
"I had never visited a bird park before (only an open air netted aviary) and was glad that I visited the one in Jurong. It is a bit difficult to get to as it is one of the corners of Singapore but going there was totally worth it. The bird shows were amazing, especially the one where they made of pelicans do a show. We saw a lot of unique variety of birds."
"I'm not the biggest bird person, but me and my kids had a good, memorable time here. We went to two bird shows, had our pictures taken holding birds and got to feed penguins. We also enjoyed the aviary and butterfly area. Make sure you go the the bird aviary, the place is huge and very nice."
Amazing place we saw lot of verity of birds in one place. and very important things We can access toilet and drinking water all the side of the park very neat and clean.
The Bird park is excellent .Especially the opportunity to take pictures with parrots and paraquats.
"The park is great, beautiful vegetation and lots and lots of birds. We saw one show and the whole family was amazed to witness a parrot talking. Excellent service as always in SGStrongly recommend it."
Well laid out with a good variety of birds from around the world including penguins (in Singapore!). A netted area for seeing birds flying around is a good way of interacting with the birds and is also very well kept to make it feel like you are in the environment the birds would naturally be in.
"Jurong bird park is a must see at Singapore. it is well connected by public transport.. Got WiFi and good eat outs there to cater for all cuisines.The shows there - Raptors and Macaus should not be missed.. The timings are available on their web site..The best part is the Lory loft.. You can have the beautiful birds come and sit on your shoulder, arms and head too!!Water for drinking is available at dispensers ... You can refill your bottles there...so you are not forced to buy bottles.The water park for kids is amazing..make sure to carry swimming costume and clothes change for kids.... This applies to all the attractions..Zoo, Gardens by the bay too...A lovely place to spend time with kids and family.."
"Jurong bird park is the best in the world, according to me. I was amazed to see the collection of exotic birds this zoo houses.What's even more appealing is that you get to feed some birds on your own. If you're allergic to them, kindly keep away since you would be surrounded with hundreds of birds to get the feed from you. It will try getting over you from the front & behind.You could also get to click a picture with some exotic/rare birds but it comes at a cost. If you don't mind spending money, do go for it. You cannot have it clicked on your camera or mobile."
This is the one place that I try and visit in Singapore every time I go there. While Australia has some great bird parks which I love the Jurong Bird Park has to be my favourite. You can spend hours hear and not get fed up.
"Although this park is well out of the city, it was easy to travel there and back by taxi. We very much enjoyed our visit, including the live show. There is a good variety of colourful birds."
You just cant experience by words.Just take a visit and be happy.Good pace for both kids and elders
"This a must do if you are in Spore & if you are travelling with Kids. A bit far from the city centre but it has a lot to offer. There are many a kind of species of birds, You can find peacocks roaming on the pathway along with you. Must see are the Penguins there are many kinds of it. Also, do not miss the Pools Amphitheatre its amust see show daily 3:30 Pm"
"This is actually situated in an industrial area. The bird park is quite vast and takes about an hour or two to complete the entire tour of the park. The kids will love the park. There are walk through aviaries and you can see birds flying past you. If you reach there by the feeding time, then you might be lucky to have them fed from your hands. From Flamingoes to Eagles, the bird park boasts of many species."
"I generally don't like zoos (I despise seeing animals in cages), but this zoo treats the animals very well. The aviaries are enormous, and most of the birds are in open-air parks. It is also very efficiently paved, so that one doesn't have to walk overmuch to see all the exhibits (especially useful on hot days). I probably spent more time there than most visitors, and I still finished the whole park in about four hours."
"A really enjoyable experience at Jurong Bird Park. The highlight was the High Flyers Show, complete with talking parrots and flying hornbills. The kids loved it. Some exhibits are better than others (my favourite was the birds of prey), but there are lots of nice touches like the Bird Discovery Centre and the large aviary with natural waterfall. And, being Singapore, there's a water park for the kids to play in at the end of the day.The only downsides are (1) having to pay extra to ride the tram; it's not too expensive but should probably just be included in the price of entry, and (2) the location is not that convenient so you are better off catching a taxi there if you don't have a car."
The Jurong Birds Park visit has been most enjoyableGreat selection of birds from all over the world in a park with beautiful landscapeEasy to walk but if required the tram service is very good and is going frequently around all the attractionsThe different shows are a must and very educational to learn about the different kind of animalsWe enjoyed most the Hawks Eagel and Voucher showWe ha a great day
Welcoming staff.. ..feeding bird is very nice attraction. Kids will enjoy a lot. Also small water park is add on for young children while Adults can get rest for sometime
"Lovely place to take your kids. Make sure to catch the bird shows. The penguin feeding is also fun! A lovely place to be in. Much smaller than other attractions which means there's much much less walking to do. You can rent buggies, strollers etc for a very small price. It's beautifully maintained with some amazingly friendly staff. Their dedication is just simply amazing!"
"We travelled 1 1/2 hours each way by metro and bus, but it was well worth the trip. There are an amazing collection of colourful birds, well set out. There is a tram available to take you from area to area. Apparently the park is to be moved to the zoo site over the next 12 months."
"A popular tourist attraction in Jurong, Singapore. The Bird park is an aviary spread across approximately 50 acres of land and is managed by Singapore Wildlife reserves.It is world famous bird zoo boasting some of the rarest and finest collections of birds across the globe. There are entry tickets to the park and this can be combined with or without a tram ride which operates from point to point inside the park. Tickets can be bought online or at the park plaza. The park is separated into various exhibits or zones.The waterfall aviary focuses on birds from Africa, Wings of Asia consist of collection from south east Asia, Parrot paradise, penguin coast, pelican cove, Flamingo pool and more. There are shows organized at designated timings and locations. The popular one being the High Flyers show - This bird show has the world's largest number of performing birds in a single act, includes Hornbill and Toucans. The park has numerous public amenities including restaurants, cafeteria, souvenir shop. There is a Pizza Hut counter as well.The park is accessible using buses from Boon Lay Interchange station of East West MRT Line. For future reference, the current location will no more be used and it will be shifted to a new location with a new name from 2020."
"I and my husband just returned back from Singapore trip where we happened to visit Jurong Bird Park away from our busy schedule and to our very best we were extremely happy for what we got to see especially with the help of Arshley Brian who challenged us with the wide knowledge he had on different birds.Arshley was our guide and its so unfortunate that his just orienting with the bird park for two weeks then he goes back to his country,He was our very best guide around with a unique hand of care,His one of the Guides in Uganda and to me I would definitely recommend him for your Ugandan Safari,his a young brilliant man and very passionate about what he does.If you're visiting Singapore soon don't hesitate to ask for Arshley Brian.He will create memories for you in just a short spell of visiting the Bird Park.Jurong Bird Park is a good place to see a lot of world bird species in a short time."
"I have been to Singapore 3 times and every time I go to Jurong Bird Park, it is easily the best place in Singapore and never gets boring! The staff are very kind and very smart, If you have never been or even if you have you need to go!"
This was my 4th visit to the bird park and I'm still not tired of it. Not just for young kids this is amazing for adults as well. The High flyers show and Lory Loft are the very best not to mention the signature Toucan
luckily we were on time for bird show (11 am) which was awesome. a peaceful place to spend quality time with nature
"We went to Jurong Bird Park during Chinese New Year. We arrived at around 8:30 am when the park was opening by taxi. Before it got crowded, we managed to look around the penguins and flamingos. Then we looked the shows such as ""Birds of prey"" and ""High flyers"" by noon.After we had luch in the park, we looked around all the places including feeding the budgies at the park. We enjoyed ourselves looking at lots of colourful birds and recommend everyone to go there."
"Have you just start your journey with a mind filled with tiredness in Singapore .. ?Then, don't worry..!This is the place to get you energised and refresh yourself with happiness and relieve your tiredness..This place also has a mini tram facility. You can get Ticket for the mini tram in the entrance..Excellent maintainance..You should not miss the following places in this park..01. Parrots paradise - inside the park02.

Waterfall Aviary - I side the parkThere is also a souvenir shop in the entrance in which you could also get food items and Snacks..Don't miss this place and don't ever rush to come out of the park..enjoy your time and feel relaxed.."
"I have been wanting to visit Jurong Bird Park for a long time & it did not disappoint when I finally made it there last week!If you love birds, this place is a must because it is amazing!So many species to see, especially in the waterfall aviary!There are birds of many colours & sizes everywhere and sometimes you don't really know where to look!The breeding centre was very cool! Got to see a couple of chicks in the incubators & watch the keepers looking after them!I very much enjoyed my time there!"
"Best attraction for nature loving persons. You are amidst various types of birds, greenery and water. Birds are staying freely in this area and they are not scared of visiting public!Tickets for this attraction were part of 4 packages we bought at Singapore Zoo though this place is situated at a different location. I went there with wife and adult children. Had a wonderful and memorable time. There's a bird show also (held twice a day for about half hour duration) wherein the trained birds perform various tasks and they can even talk to the trainer. There are trams to take you to various places so that you don't waste time to visit various locations. Guidance/information boards are plenty and they don't confuse you!Attraction has been very well conceived, executed and maintained. There's a waterfall aviary too. On overall it's just too good an attraction. It's a must visit attraction in Singapore."
"Jurong bird park is a nice place to see hundreds of variety of birds from all over the world in one place. Quite a few of these birds are on the verge of extinction or are very rare to sight in natural habitats. This aviary is planned to be moved to an alternate location near the zoo on Mandai Lake Road.Jurong Bird Park has several bird species including a large flock of flamingos. It is currently the world's largest bird park in terms of the number of birds and second largest both in the number of bird species and land area. The biggest on this criteria exists in Germany.The aviary has several areas which can be visited like Waterfall Aviary, Dinosaur Descendants, Lory Loft, Wings of Asia, World of Darkness, Parrot Paradise, Penguin Coast, Flamingo Pool & Flamingo Lake, etc. We also liked the Breeding and Research Centre which shows how the rescued birds are cared for and some of the important research work going on here.There are a few Bird shows which one must go for - High Flyers show, Kings of the Skies show and Lunch with Parrots. All the shows ensure good participation from the tourists visiting the park.There is a nice tram which we used to travel all across the aviary. This is really useful in saving time and is less tiring. Please ensure while buying the tickets you include cost of tram in the same. I"
"We were amazed at how beautifully organised this park is, the variety of birds it has - lots of which we had never seen before or knew existed - and the perfect amount of information it provides to make it interesting to learn. All set in a natural forest. We particularly loved the open areas like the waterfall aviary where birds do not seem caged, the flamingoes and the shows. The highlights for us were the parrot paradise and the keepers talks.Definitely worth visiting whilst at Singapore. If you go with young kids, do not miss the Birds of Play area bring their swimwear as there is a water playground for them to enjoy. The park is quite big, but you can get the tram ride if you do not prefer to walk too much."
Truly lovely to see a beautiful collection of birds with such stunning colours. The male peacock in particular with its full set of feathers a special delight. Go see !
I am not a huge fan of birds so was a little nervous about the bird park but the birdlife here is amazing- a must see
There are many birthday parties happening here. It's also a great place to bring your spouse or siblings. The birds are singing in the rain.
"A lovely place to watch various types of hornbill , macaw , parrot. They have good collection of penguins."
Great place to visit with your children or solo. A place one shouldn't miss while visiting Singapore.
"there are birds which are endangered species. different kind of birds. we also saw a bird show, this is really surprising to see how birds are trained and do as perfectly as per instructions. birds are fed a particular time and even tourists are given appurtunity to feed birds. there is a water fall in the birds park."
"Highly recommended. Well organised park with elevated viewing areas to make it easier to see birds high up in the enclosures. Average time spent is 3-4 hours, but we happily stayed 4-5 hours including a refreshment stop."
"Jurong Bird Park - a must for all nature and bird lovers. There are specimens of magnificent bird life from around the world for viewing. 1 of the many attractions is the Waterfall Aviary, which focuses mostly on birds from Africa, has bird enclosures that extend to a towering height of 35 metres. All the other attractions including thebird show which has the world's largest number of performing birds in a single act should not be missed. A great place to visit for locals & tourists, young & old."
Fantastic refreshing manmade waterfall with aviary of birds & butterflies .A must visit in Singapore. Come & experience yourself. I like it ï¸
"As a nature photographer this has been a regular haunt of mine over the years. Here birds are on view from many parts of the world and some are in amazing large aviaries. If you dont want to hunt them down in the jungle or whatever their natural habitat may be, then this is a great place to spend the day. Get a pass that includes the Zoo and the Night Safari."
It was wonderful to visit this park. Not did we see various birds but there was also an open air bird show. I was amazed at how birds too follow instructions. It's Educational for kids as well.
First visit to Jurong but regular visitor to Singapore. This is a great outing for all different types of tourists and family friendly. It is a great stroll with a huge variety of birds to view in a variety of natural habitats. The diversity of birds was most impressive including a large number of endangered species. The information provided on each species was most useful. We were there on a particularly hot day so really appreciated being able to hop on and off the train as we went to different parts of the park. The artificial waterfall was a great photo opportunity. The individual shows were both informative and entertaining. I would thoroughly recommend this park if you have a couple of spare hours. It is accessible by public transport if you are prepared to train and bus.
"As always, it was a delight to visit this amazing bird park !! :-) we'll definitely come back! All the more reasons since I became a proud member :-))"
Beautiful and exotic birds all in a lush tropical setting. I particularly liked the bird enclosure which gives you a close encounter with the birds as they road within freely.
"Really impressed with this park, despite its age it doesn't show it at all. Everything is very clean and well maintained, loads of birds everywhere for kids to ogle over. The show is also really fun!"
beautiful visit of this park with colorful and interesting birds. There are aviaries in which one can enter and see the birds more closely. It takes 4-5 hours to go around.
We loved doing the hands on encounter at Jurong. Getting up close to the amazing raptors and Sally the hornbill who won over our hearts was a great experience. The park is filled with friendly staff and wonderful birds. Cant wait to see the new park in 2020
Everything in this park is beautiful and there is a wide variety of birds. It is quite big so you need to spend around 4 hours at least to see all birds.
"Visited Jurong Bird park recently in December 2018. I must say that it was a wonderful day, all thanks to the courteous and supportive staff, ever ready to facilitate the visitors by all means! The High Flyers show at the pools amphi theatre won my heart, as to how they have trained their animals and birds about the concept of Reuse, Recycle and Reduce, and also educate the audience about it in a healthy way. HATS OFF TO BPR team and Management."
"Jurong bird park is one of its kind bird reserve. Well maintained, nicely spread out and some really interesting activities with the birds."
Got to the park by 9.30 before it got busyLovely shaded walk. Beautiful planting. Saw a large iguana on the path.Well mapped out.Wonderful up close birds.The waterfall enclosure had loads of different species - particularly liked watching the weaver birds make their nest.Amazing blue macaws.Wonderful parrot enclosure where the birds fed from your hand.Good water park for the kids.The penguins looked rather depressed!Would definitely return.
"Jurong bird park is one of the four wildlife reserves in Singapore, which is located away from the other three, lying on the West part. It takes time to travel to the park but there are clear instructions on its website.We love the way how the park keeps the birds that they give them as much space as possible to move around and the birds look great. The park also has different points that tells people about the history of bird and how they nurse them before joining them with other birds to face the public. It could be quite relaxing to walk around and we finally spent 3 hours in the park. To save some money, you could purchase park hoppers to make a bundle with other wildlife reserves. It worths."
One of the unique experiences in Jurong Bird park is the visit to the incubation center. You can see eggs hatching and hatchlings being fed by experts. Its a unique experience. Birds in the waterfall aviary are free to roam around and they are very visitor friendly. its a nice peaceful place and fun to visit. typical time to visit is 3-4 hours.
"Spent a delightful few hours exploring this site. Birds are well cared for and site is extremely well maintained and clean.Great variety of birds to see and easy to walk around and view the different areas. Sudden Singapore downpour didn't even spoil our visit. Well worth a look at. Will be moving to new site new Singapore Zoo sometime soon, so will definitely have to return for a look at this new site."
"The Jurong Bird Park is moving closer to the Zoo in two years. It's a shame because this is a magnificent attraction for bird lovers (and even non Bird lovers), with walk-through aviaries, well attended gardens, plenty of birdlife, unusual toucans, an amazing collection of macaws, including the very rare Sphix's macaw and of course the hard to find Hornbills (which because of their aggressive nature are not ""walk through."" In fact this is much better than the zoo. Highly recommend. Plus they have Penguins."
"Amazing place. So many different species of birds you can see up close. Birds of prey, parrots, Hornbills, Bird of Paradise and so many more. You need to allow at least 4 hours to really appreciate this place. A must visit when in Singapore."
"The Jurong Bird Park is not the easiest attraction to get to, being around 20 kilometres from the city centre. To get there I took the MRT on the green East-West line and got off at Boon Lay MRT station. The public bus number 194 goes from Boon Lay MRT to the front gate of the Jurong Bird Park in about 7 minutes. You can do the same on the return trip but have to walk across the road in the pedestrian tunnel to catch the 194 bus on the other side of the road to return to Boon Lay MRT station.Being so far out of town the park wasn't crowded compared to other Singaporean attractions and I bought my entry ticket at the gate without queuing. You have the option to pay $5 for unlimited use of the tram inside the bird park, I definitely recommend this even for a keen walker, as the tram does loops of the park which makes it easy to move around and see which sites worth visiting.This bird park have some unique birds I haven't anywhere else and the park have plenty of lush green gardens with flowering plants and scenic lakes. The main highlight is the 11am show at the Pools Amphitheatre, but the penguin feeding and the 30 metre tall waterfall were also very impressive.You can buy food and drink from several outlets inside the park which even has a Pizza Hut, and well maintained restrooms are scattered throughout. My visit to this bird park took me 6 hours from the time I left the hotel until my return, so if planning to visit the park you should budget at least half a day for a proper visit."
"If you're staying in Singapore you must visit the Jurong bird park, the bird show is fantastic and will keep you spellbound, take your time to walk around as there is a surprise around every corner, of course in the wet season take your poncho or brolly because it will bucket down...marvel at the penguin display and take in the beautiful waterfall while having your lunch...."
It was a fabulous trip. We walked the park and enjoyed all the displays. Well marked. Park was very clean and staff were eager to assist. Refreshments were delish. We enjoyed the trip to the park tremendously
"Visited the park with my 6-year-old grandson who had a splashing good time at the water park The bird show was entertaining though the parrot did not quite sing as expected. The birds in both the walk-in aviaries were completely unafraid of visitors. The lorikeets were boisterous, the crowned blue pigeon and the aptly named ""superb starling"" were enchanting."
"My wife, granddaughter and I had a very enjoyable time at the bird park. The waterfall and the bird show was entertaining and wonderful. Will definitely let all my friends know about the fantastic bird park experience."
As usual the park was very well maintained and facilities were spotless - The location is fantastic and the variety of birds awesome - an absolute must see in Singapore even for a short stay.
"First bird park I have ever been, enchanting collection of bird with large areas for birds to roam around. Beautiful setting of natural like water falls. The park staff are very friendly."
"Jurong Bird Park has great live shows & overall experience was unforgettable. Multi colored birds, parrots, macaws everywhere."
A lot of different animals to see I thought will be dirty and smell but I find out it so clean and tidy place.u can see the bird fly here and there.they also had show of the bird but please check the timing before u walk around
Haven't been there since i was a boy. Pretty wonderful place to visit on a weekend alone. Well maintained and clean park. Definitely must watch the bird show.
"There is a big water game place for children, a great show and a lot of different bird species. I definitely recommend this park to visit."
"Jurong birdpark has come a long way. I remember vividly visiting the birdpark as a small child, amazed by the number of species of birds there. My wife (then girlfriend) and I visited the birdpark back in 2012 and we had a very memorable visit. Now, I have became a father, we brought our son there to experience the wonderful park. He enjoyed every moment of it to the fullest!"
"Is a good place to go with children or family to have a learning journey. Some parts visitors may stay with birds inside the cage, is a different experience visitor may want to try it. Besides, there's few shows to let visitors watch the birds closely."
A must visit for any trip to Singapore . Not to miss are the two shows they do at 11 am and 3 pm where the fantastic birds have been trained to entertain the audience. Kids would just love it as much as adults would be over awed. A nice toy train takes you around the park with stops if you don't feel like walking the entire the Area. An Aviary has a large collection of birds from all over the world with well written write ups. .
I went to the park with my 7yrs old kid. He thoroughly enjoyed the tour. Do not miss the High flying show there. A beautifully organized show of the birds. You can take photos with the flamingos if you want after the show.In the park there is a artificial water falls and flamingo pool.
"We have just returned from an amazing ""behind the scnes"" tour in Juring Bird Park. They call the tour ""Birds Eye Tour"". We had a wonderful and amazing nearly 2 hours tour with a number of very freindly/experienched and knowlegdeable staff. It was really great and can only recommend this special tour for other bird lovers. We got a lot of great pictures and indsides with us home. We even got a feather from the Owl as a souvenir. Great. The Bird parc is also really a great experince in it self and really value for money. We used 6 hours in teh park and saw both their bird shows."
The park is very diverse. It offers family fun or just a place to see you favourite bird alone. You may take a bus train tour and pick a place of interest to spend more time. Excellent are the huge cages where you are facing birds flying around you. There is a variety of bird shows which are entertaining old and young. Remember to bring a lot of water with you. Catering is basic but tasty.
jurong bird park is away from the other 3 places (zoo etc). you need to take uber or normal cab to reach this place. the feeding time shows are very nice. the tram pass within the park is worth it else you will have to walk a lot! dont miss any stations!
"Our visit was filled with awe and awesome. Each display is large enough to let the birds move about in unrestricted fashion, which made me less guilty for seeing them in captivity. The one big loop layout makes walking along effective and non-repetitive. The extra money for including the shuttle pass is totally worth it. The displays are large enough with several birds that make it easy to spot them while in the shuttle.Kid and husband enjoyed feeding the birds a lot. Unfortunately by the time I got my turn the birds had been given a snack of grapes and thus non were around. Witnessing the interaction with birds during this feeding left me speechless. The birds communicated with movements and it was clear what they were trying to convey. This is an experience that shall forever stay with me.The park has a very interesting water play area, where the kid spend well over 3 hours and had to be coerced out at closing.While he was enjoying the cold splash I got to chat with Maggie on staff, who was studying lightening data for the park system. We had an insightful conversation about Singapore food culture, other playground, diversity, education system and what not. A big shout out to her for helping me understand Singapore a lot more.We had an amazing day and wish there was more time to go once again during the week long vacation.The cafes have great food options and the gift shop has some real neat stuff for sale.The restroom designs are very clever and they are maintained extremely efficiently. I would recommend an entire day here at least."
Good place to visit. Great display of the different birds in the world. Good show performance too! Recommended!
"The best bird experience ever. Usually birds are hard to see. With few exceptions we saw all the birds we wanted to see. The difficult ones were the hornbills. (See the review that mentions the Birds' eye tour, which does that.) It will be good in 2020 when the bird park is near the zoo. Until that take the trip: $20 taxi from the centre."
"The bird park was really good, it is educational and it is good to see that it is playing a part in the conservation of endangered species."
"I like the shows on offer , they are near to nature not altering the natural well being of birds with lot of information about the species. Very well designed bird park as if moving in natural trails"
"It was a wonderful experience visiting JBP with family and kid. A must visit place, the shows were amazing."
My and my family enjoyed the Bird show as well as feeding to the birds. They come and sit on you hand. Feed them by your hand.
"Jurong Bird Park is a must see for bird lovers in Singapore, in fact, a must see attraction for all. Pigeons, doves, parrots, flamingos, pelicans, hornbills - you are going to surely have a great time amidst nature.I recommend buying tickets online, for there is a long queue at the ticketing counters at the park and thus, it costs time. Taxi is the best way to come to Jurong Bird Park, since the MRT-Bus Combo takes a very long time and is inconvenient, too.Lory Loft, Waterfall Aviary, Wings of Asia, Royal Ramble, the show, Flamingo and Pelican Lakes, Hornbills, are some of the many sights worth visiting. Not to forget the beautiful Penguin Coast just at the entrance.There are many dining options there, with Pizza Hut Express being inside the premises of Jurong Bird Park. I recommend buying the ticket for the unlimited Tram Ride too, if travelling with elderly or small children. Very convenient and not expensive.Being a pigeon lover, I loved the aviary ""Wings of Asia"", where there was a large variety of friendly-pigeons.Definitely recommend this memorable attraction!"
"It's a lovely park. We enjoyed 'lory loft' the most. The lorries are so friendly, they actually come and sit on your hand and you can even feed them (you have to buy their food from the counter). All the shows were worth watching too"
"Good ambience and enviroment, many interested venue to looking for.. Entertaining enough... will take my family for next trip to singapore..."
"I went here about 6 years ago for the first time and loved it so much. It was a must see on this trip back to Singapore and wasnt disappointed. They have added quite a bit since I was here last time and really improved other attractions. Took us about 3 hours to tour the park. I was especially excited for the rare macaws that are on display ....the Spix;s for example are extinct in the wild and only 150 in captiviity, so it was a real treat to get to see them in person. I love feeding the lories and lorikeets in their massive aviary but it did seem like there were much fewer in number than last time I was here. Most people seemed to have a hard time getting enough birds to drink all the nectar they provide. Most everyone just set the little cups down because there arent enough birds interested in coming around to drink the nectar. Anyway, its worth the trip out to Jurong. TAkes about 45mins from downtown. We took the green line all the way to Boon Lay station from City Hall. Didn't have to change lines that way. Then you transfer to the 194 bus for about 10 mins and it drops you off in front of the park. Cost us S$1.60 each for the bus, you need exact change and just pay on the bus. The bus depot at Boon Lay station is easy to navigate and find the bus. Definitely cant wait to go back!!"
"This park is very well laid out. If you intend to visit the Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari, the 4-park ticket can save you a lot of money and this 4-park pass can be purchased at the first of any of the afore-mentioned parks. for an extra $S10 you can purchase train rides at these venues. As the weather was very humid, after walking through the parks, the ride to top off the day was very welcome."
"I wasn't attracted to the bird park due to the location and less marketing. It was my first time seeing a completed bird park and honestly speaking, I was amazed by the well-organized daily activities and a huge place to walk around. It's good to bring sufficient drinks, umbrella, and shades along with you."
"There was a wide variety of birds, could feed the birds as well. Well organized. Couldn't catch a show but enjoyed the experience."
I brought my familiar here. My son enjoyed the birds. We took photos with the birds too. The park is very clean and very organized.
Loved the zoo and also the night zoo which is just across the road. Sentosa Island is also worth the trip especially the aquarium
"Best place in the world. Period.I pre booked my ticket online and planned out my 5 days in Singapore from Australia, scheduling the bird park for the first day. 3 days later we ran around the aquarium as fast as we could just to make a second trip to Jurong again.I am a zoo keeper and love visiting zoos in different countries. I had always heard great things about Jurong from fellow bird lovers, keepers and breeders. I was not dissatisfied at all!We decided to do the Birds Eye Tour where we got to meet a beautiful hornbill names Sally (shout out to her keeper Maddy!). We also got to fly a bird of prey on the glove. Our tour guide Grace was amazing. Such a beautiful person who couldn't love her job anymore and was just happy to show people around in hopes her enthusiasm for the birds would rub off.After the tour, we met up with Peter the hornbill keeper who took a good hour out of his extremely busy day to educate us on his birds. I started off knowing absolutely nothing about hornbills, to them being one of my favorite birds. Thank you so much Peter for your hospitality! This guy needs a pay rise, such a legend.I'd also like to mention Mark in the breeding centre. He introduced us to a baby spoonbill which we got to feed, and we joked about how much of a pain eclectus parrots are to handraise. He had a smile on his face the whole time.In Australia, zoo keepers always seem to want to 'one up' each other in their facilities and keep training tips to themselves because they don't want another zoo to be 'better' than them, but Jurong was nothing like that. Grace mentioned that if any of my keeping friends wanted help knowing how to breed certain birds, Jurong would love to give them some tips. That's what the bird world is all about. Helping each other out.So not only was the staff AMAZING but the actual exhibits were next level. The lory loft was my personal favorite as I am obsessed with lorikeets and own and handraised a few of my own. The waterfall exhibit with the African greys also gets a special mention.So thanks Jurong for being the best bird park around and now my all time favorite zoo."
"This jungle-like park is an awesome way to spend a few hours. There are many attractions and different bird species wherever you turn, and the performances are well done as well.My recommendation - get there as early as possible before it gets too hot and crowded."
"Since I love birds, its possible to avoid the long queues and book online entry ticket. I was so enamoured by the exciting bird shows that I was able to witness. I spent 4 hours here as there were so many antics and species of birds to see."
"What a beautiful place however, we decided to skip few birds as we aren't avid bird fans. However, whatever we saw (the shows) was mesmerizing and will stay with us forever.Photograph prices are too steep and I doubt even 1% of visitors buy it. Why not reduce it to sligllhtly normal levels and make more people buy it. You can still make very decent money. Think about it :)"
"Been here with my family and it's an incredible experience, not just the variety of birds but the shows they put up are extremely good. Recommend not to miss the shows as one could never get so close in life to these birds in an open environment. The park is Maintained very well and adequately staffed. Recommend to buy the 4 in 1 pass as it's cost effective."
Excellent location for a fun filled weekend/vacation morning. Only suggestion is to go in a bit early around 0830am. Tends to get really crowded esp during holiday season. Make sure you enjoy the various bird shows (Timings are generally aval online). Have fun!
The Jurong bird park is a must visit when in Singapore. You can see birds that you would have little chance of seeing anywhere else. We paid for the birds eye tour and what an amazing experience that was worth more than what we paid I feel. On the day we visited no one else had booked the tour so we had our own private one hour experience. Getting to handle birds of prey was a once in a lifetime experience and Sally the Hornbill was just gorgeous. The staff and keepers go out of their way to ensure you have a fantastic experience
We took the 4-in-1 package from the Zoo and after 3 days we went to this Bird Park and it was probably one of the best decisions we took in Singapore. The Park is huge and it takes at least 4-5 hours to see at your own pace the amazing birds from above and below.
Best choice for family outing. Show is great and variety of birds to look. Children enjoy the tram ride and bird shows.It would be better if there is bird's feeding place so children can have some activity with birds.Oh yeah the photo taking session at the entrance is great but a bit pricey.
"Huge park full of different kinds of birds. They had fantastic shows as well '¦ staff were lovely, really working hard on making guests enjoy themselves ...We got the chance to feed some birds '¦ and watch tricks and cool shows.The best thing was the tram that allowed us to have a glimpse of the whole park at first before we start roaming on foot.Such a lovely time '¦ highly recommended for everyone of all ages.Those intending to but 4 parks tickets, it is best to be visit Jurong park on a different day to enjoy as many shows without rushing."
This is a great day out for all of the family. The park is very well set up and well cared for. They do a great job of giving the birds as much freedom as possible while still making it easy to see the birds. The bird shows are excellent and the staff do a great job. Definitely a 'must see' in Singapore.
Our family had a wonderful time exploring the bird park and feeding of birds. A great chance for childen and adults to bond and learn together!
"Jurong Bird Park is one of my favorite places to spend a whole day whenever I visit the modern and vibrant Merlion City.Jurong Bird Park is Asia's largest, with a collection of over 5,000 birds from 400 species, including some endangered species like the birds of paradise, macaws, birds of prey, etc.This bird park offers so much fun and education towards its visitors about the life of bird. There are some exhibits and two that I like most are the ""Penguin Coast"" and the ""World of Darkness"". In Penguin Coast you will see how several penguin species are put together in a coastal-area-like exhibit. They can swim and hop on rocky surfaces, while sometimes they will just lay down and cooling themselves lazily on the ice made by the ice machine. You must come to their feeding time to see them swimming to catch fish from their keepers.The World of Darkness exhibit is home to several owl species. Since most owl species are nocturnal, the ambience is controlled in such a way that inside the owl exhibit, the day time is turned into night time. Thus, you will see the owls actively flying and preening their feathers, also hunting for food. However, the last time I visit the park, they already closed down the owl exhibit.The highlight of the bird park in my opinion, is the bird show. You must not miss the two bird shows, the ""High Flyers"" and the ""King of the Skies"". The High Flyers show will let you see some bird species demonstrate their ability, like the talking parrots. While the King of the Skies show will let you mesmerized by the keen senses of birds of prey when they are hunting for food in the wild. You should also see the feeding frenzy of the pelican, the keepers will introduce you to the 9 pelican species in the bird park while feeding them their favorite fish. It is a trully nice experience to have since some of the pelicans will fly above your head with their massive wingspan, circling around the pond, yet they are not flying away.Jurong Bird Park, in my opinion, is a must visit place when you go to Singapore. It is one good place for adult and children alike to learn a lot about the life of bird and the conservation efforts done by the Wildlife Reserve Singapore to save them from extinction.""Jurong Bird Park - Where color lives""p.s. I do not know if it is a temporary program or not, but if you fly Singapore Airlines or SilkAir, do not forget to bring your boarding pass with you to the park to get a 10% discount on your admission fee."
"Must watch for all who go to Singapore . The penguin are primary attraction, u can feed them on availability basis . The birds performances are amazing. Four shows are there 10:30,11:30,1:30,3:00.all r different shows. Don't miss"
It is easy to get to the park. There are a lot of different kinds of species. I like the experience that we can get closer to birds and take photos of them. But I saw a rat in the aviary...
"- The jurong bird park can be easily termed as the best Singapore attraction. So many birds with so much chirping was extraordinary. The 2nd tram stop of Lory Loft with parrot feeding was out of world. - There are two shows i.e.1000 hrs (king of sky/ eagle show) and 1045 hrs (high flyers show). The high flyer show was great and should not be missed. But as we reached late, we missed the 1000 hrs show. The same show is repeated at 1600 hrs. But we could not wait till then and left at 1430 hrs. So either you reach 0930 hrs or 1400 hrs. There are also bird feeding shows of penguins and pelican. Both were great and are must watch."
Overall the place was very clean and lesser crowds compare to the zoo. Staffs was all very friendly!
"The bird park was beautiful, clean and organised. The rangers were so friendly and efficient. Thank you so much for the amazing experience!!"
Jurong bird park always special - i would seen shows many times and still it is amazing and exciting. every bird you look at feel refreshed . wonderfully kept .thanks a lot for making my day
"Feeding the penguins, parakeets, pelicans, flamingoes, etc was a great experience for my 7 year old nephew. Very well managed. The shows are very informative while at the same time fun and entertaining. Only One issue - THEY DO NOT ACCEPT CARDS FOR ANY FEEDING THE BIRDS ETC ACTIVITIES INSIDE THE PARK, you need to pay with cash."
The events and shows were well organised and the birds were a treat to watch.The wings of fire show is a must watch for all bird enthusiasts.
Great place - shows are excellent.Would suggest the park hopper tickets - if travelling with kids - unlimited tram rides are the best bet. Take a tram ride first and then visit the enclosures. Plan well in advance for the shows - arrive 15 - 20 min. before shows starts.Worth a visit indeed.
Our first ever trip to the Jurong Bird Park as a family. The kids love it! The shows were great and the water-play area is a huge bonus :)
Amazingly diverse collection of birds. Shows were fun too. Give yourself half a day to cover everything and get the tram ride (additional $5) to save you time.
"Amazing park! Very well maintained, clean, offer some bird play shows ! We loved it a lot! Well organized as well. If you are tired to walk by foot, you can take tram."
"If you like birds or wildlife in general, you'll love this park. They have hundreds of species of birds, many endangered, In beautiful open habitats. The pelicans were my favorites. They have all the known species."
Was last here 11 years ago and loved how the Bird Park had improved. Family all loved seeing all the birds and had an awesome day. Very easy to get to by public transport
Really enjoyed our trip here. Staff were excellent and the birds at the shows were very impressive. It was great to see the birds all looking so healthy and well cared for by the park. The focus on conservation was also very good. A must visit for animal lovers.
"What a wonderful place! So many beautiful birds and wildlife. Even if you arent totally into birds, this place is beautifully fascinating! As for me...well I LOVE FLAMINGOS and this place had srveral varieties of Flamingos! So fabulous! And the staff are amazing, caring and so friendly. Very impressed."
We spent the whole day at the bird park!!! So amazing. The enclosures are all suited to the individual birdlife and sprinklers were going to cool the birds which was good to see. Lots of open enclosures for the birds to fly around. A lot of focus on conversation and preservation which was great to see. An amazing place and highly recommended. Lots of water refill stations everywhere which is great to see. Just amazing.
"Recommended not only for children, even adults! Do not miss and buy food for parrots and feed them - the beast."
"I loved this place. At one with nature and pretty birds, ugly birds, colorful birds, and plain birds. Lots and lots of walking so be prepared."
beautiful birds to look by and stupendous performances by the birds makes you wonder their abilities and agility.
"One of the best places for bird lovers in Singapore. I spend about 8hrs.Timings are 9am- 5:30-6pm, weekdays are the best if you don't want the crowd. Check out the bird shows are go half an hr prior the show to get good seats. Worth waiting extra to watch it.There are trams inside which take you to different stops and you can get off at any stop look around and get back onto another tram.Food and beverages available inside the premises at decent rates.Kids will enjoy this place and so will adults and senior members.Loads of birds are seen, and you can feed parrots too, thoroughly enjoyed every minute.Bird shows -Experience -Maintenance -Food Price - $$$"
"Excellent day out. lots to see. The walk in enclosures were a highlight, as there was an opportunity to feed the parrots, which was great fun"
"Must love birds. I caught the 194 bus from Boon Lay (apparently the only bus to the park). The good thing is that the bus stop on the way home is the same stop (glad I asked the driver). It's a brief walk across the road to the park. Entry is reasonable, and more cost effective if you are considering going to some of the other attractions (had I known this, I might have spent my time a little differently). The park is around 2km in distance, and is designed so you walk a circuit to see all the areas. There is a train which is hop on/off for $5, however I preferred the exercise. You need to be able bodied to have the best experience. For example, the toucans were best viewed from the second level, and the lory loft feels like a ropes course. The highlight of my day was the show in the amphitheatre, up close with the macaws, flamingos (why do they not fly away?!), toucans etc. It was a fabulous way to spend half the day on the last one for my trip."
"Our kids have a thing for birds! With no Toucans in Australia this was our little boys, 9, first chance to see a toucan. Just prior to the bird show we asked a staff member if there was any chance at all that he could see a toucan up close after the show, he said sure he can hold them! So our boy got to be the child in the audience who had two toucans land on his arms. The smile on his face I won't ever forget!!I would suggest planning your day priority bird wise as it is over quite a large area and the heat/humidity factor takes its toll on walking. The huge aviary was pretty impressive, the bird shows a must do. The gardens are lovely too and a cool off splash in the water park helped give the kids enough energy for the trip home.We did the MRT /bus option, which took about an hour from the CBD including waiting for the bus. No other tourists on either our way there or back, perhaps more tour groups or taxi's?"
The bird park has all kinds of birds on show and it's a amazing attraction to see. The shows on offer has two shows on offer and they are worthwhile to see
"Went to the Bird Park. Used the MRT and bus to get there. Used the tram to get orientated, then walked around the various aviaries and enclosures. In the Lorrie section you can buy some nectar in a cup which the birds will then drink from. They birds can get a bit annoyed if you take the nectar away!! They have all sorts of tropical birds. Worth a visit."
We were immeasurably impressed by the Jurong bird park. It is an absolutely fantastic bird park. The indoor waterfall was great. We sat and had a coffee in the cafe inside the massive aviary with beautiful parrots squawking away in the rafters. Lush. Highly recommend a visit to this amazing place
Jungle inside the city. Very interesting place for nature lover. We feel the nature with birds. Shows are very good
"If you love birds, this is one place you must go when you are in Singapore since it carries so many species of birds around the world that it is like a one stop sees all instead of having to travel to different corners of the world. To start with, the High Fly Show at the open air Amphitheatre is a definite treat to children in particular as those toucans, hornbills and colorful macaws followed the instructions of their trainers and then the finale of hundreds of flamingoes and pelicans swarming the stage was breath taking. Make sure you allot enough time to tour the Park as you probably would need to go through signs in front of cages to see which birds you are watching and then finding them sometimes also takes some effort. I was particularly impressed by the birds of paradise and the birds of prey. Highly recommended!"
"We loved the variety of birds and the way they are in kept in large spaces including walkthrough aviaries. The rare blue parrots and macaws, and the lorikeets feeding area were the highlights for us. It can be sunny so be prepared with hats, sunblock and plenty of water."
"After so long of not been to JBP, its has been a great day for me and my family outing.... Its a great workout on a very hot day for us... Overall we enjoy the day there and shall return again some day... Pls add more halal fast food there... Thanks birds..."
This is the first time we have visited Jurong its amazing the variety of birds... But our very favorite part has to be the enclosure where the parrots interact with you it was quite the experience and we got heaps of amazing photos.
"Such a lovely day out. The layout is great and you can take a fun shuttle bus around the whole park that stops at a few stops if you want to walk around.The lorikeet forest was fantastic, for a few dollars you can buy some food which essentially makes you a tree. At one point, my partner had about 4 lorikeets on her, with one waiting patiently on the side.The park is laid out well so you can easily find your favourite bird! The birds of prey were awesome.While we were there the penguins were looking after their eggs and the keeper was telling us all about them. Very cute and interesting.Thoroughly recommend for all ages."
Brought my daughter to Jurong Bird Park for the first time. She loved the place soo much. Had an awesome day at there. Will visit again at the new location.
Somehow the pace of this place is much easier than the other zoos. If you like birds you will love this place. If you are not really a bird fan you will still enjoy the gentle pace of the bird park. Might be a bit strenuous for the elderly. Loved the Ugandan shoebills.
A must visit for everyone managed very well got to see most colourful birds loved the lorry loft experience will go again had a great time shopping
"This is a really great place for kids, with a lot of variety of colorful birds. The greenery provides good shade, to walk around in sunny weather too."
"When you are planing to visit this park- make sure you check their website for attraction closure dates and showtimes.When visiting ensure to make it for the shows...you will be amazed!High flyers - must see!!! And they allow photos to be taken after the show...for free.Suggest not to take the tram, as the park is too small, you can easily walk around."
Undeniably one of the best aviation animal attractions globally... Great performance from the two shows they had... Extremely friendly staff... My little girl had a great time there!
it is a great place for kids. Very clean and well organized. They have a big wet play area for kids so don't forget your swimsuit and a towel! We had fun!
Truly a must viist for travellers to Singapore.Good shows in the park and you can get close to the birds like never before.Be in the park by 10am so you can see all the shows and experience feeding the birds.The penguin feeding was a great experience for us.
Best enjoyed by taking in the sights of each enclosure so that one can view the birds up close instead of the Tram ride as it gives just an overview of the park. Lory Loft and the Waterfall Aviary must not be missed. The Birds of Prey show is again a key attraction.
"I was not very sure of how exciting a bird park could be, but I was super amazed and impressed by the variety of birds and the quality of shows. Would definitely recommend for a day outing.Now for the staff - Excellent service and a very jovial, helpful and accommodating staff. It started raining the moment we landed and we were not sure if we will be able to view anything because of the rains, but the staff assured us that they would do whatever they can and also when we requested, they agreed for us to visit again on the same tickets. Luckily we didn't have to come again as the downpour stopped in some time.I would recommend planning your trip keeping the shows in mind. The two shows which I remember seeing are the ones with the Macaws and the Birds of Prey. All in all a great attraction"
This was a great day out. Spent 4 hours here with so much to see and do. There were wonderful demonstrations and bird shows. Up close and personal
"No disappointments on any quarter whatsoever! An absolutely must do for all animal lovers. Please study the timings for the individual shows; the birds of prey, and the parrots shows, and make it for them. The birds and their keepers are so much fun to watch in interaction rather than in their enclosures. The walk inside the park is rather long between the different bird enclosures. It would be wise to carry water bottles.A word of caution, the multiple park ticket has to be redeemed at the Zoo first, so it is possible to visit Jurong only after that."
It's a really good place to visit with young children ... there are so many birds which fly freely ... Lory birds interact with the tourists and we can also feed them ... there is a lot to walk around ... there is also a small playing area (water ) where kids can enjoy in swimming wear...young children will definitely live this place .. there is an Indian restaurant right in front which has got tasty dishes ...
Very good experience in the bird park. A lot of rare species of bird. will go there again next time.not sufficient time to go through the breeding area.
"Must include this park in the itinerary.Its a half day tour.Beautiful,clean,serene.Various types of birds can be found.Tram service is provided so as to take a tour or get a drop within the park.Walking is preferred as then all the areas are covered.Eatables are available inside.Bird show takes place at about 11am. Very well maintained park.Overall a nice experience."
"Went to Jurong bird park during our stay in Singapore. It was really easy to get to by public transport. We took the MRT to Boon Lay and then took the bus 194, which took us right in front of the bird park.After the high flyers show, we walked around the park and had some lunch. It was very hot. My children spent a long time at the waterplay so we ran out of time to see some of the birds. On leaving the park, we enquired about converting the day tickets to membership and it was a straightforward process after a SGD8 top up (as one of us is a Singaporean, we paid less on the day ticket). We went again the next day and as it was a weekday, we could go on the tram for free as members (otherwise, we would have to pay SGD16 for the whole family). We went to the Rory loft and other places.If I had noticed the price for the family membership, I would have paid for the membership earlier and then we could have got on the tram to save some walking the first day."
All aspects are best and attractive.my family members and children like very much and talking about it still. Will visit again. Keep up the good efforts.
unique experience of seeing birds behaving in a cordial manner and understanding capacity for abiding and listening and performing various acts as advised by the keeper. Also repeating what is said is something which all must see.
"This was a really fun, really cool attraction. It's REALLY out of the way, but worth going to. It's good for about . . . half a day or so. The Aviary was so cool, you could walk up to a lot of the birds and get REALLY close for pictures. The waterfall inside makes for a GREAT photo op.The parrots area was my favorite, because I love parrots. They had some amazing ones, and even a few show offs.Just really nice!"
My family enjoyed the visit to the park. The two shows viz Kite flyer and birds of paradise were very nice. We had a good time
"Though it was drizzling throughout the most part of the morning, it did not hinder much of the scheduled programmes as it went on as scheduled. As most of the enclosures were sheltered, with the tram and an umbrella, it was still manageable for my wife and I and my two young kids at the park."
This is a must visit place for nature and bird lovers. The shows are awesome and best part is where you can feed the cute birds! Simply superb place to spend at least half a day!
Jurong bird park is amazing many king of bird here I m see lots of different species bird here this best park for children to enjoy and learn about bird and there activity I am highly recommend for this park for children
Visit this attraction way back 2011 with my siblings and I have an awesome experienced.This time I visited the attractiin with my daughter and Mum. Everythings great as usual. My mum and daughter was entertained especially with the programs held in Pool ampitheAther and Hawks Arena. The hawks arena was more sctrict with all the guards around which is better. The only one i missed was the horse backriding tandem with the hunting hawk on the hunters shoulder which looks really awesome. I suggest to take the tram if u are visiting with children.Everything is this attraction is worth visiting and i recommend this for a family visit.
beautiful birds here and a great place for a full day of fun family time. lovely shows too. The restaurants are alright.
"Another great attraction in Singapore, the bird park has a variety of birds from all over the world. The bird shows are the typical shows one sees everywhere, but still worth seeing. Walking amongst all the aviaries is pleasant and easy. Habitats are well-maintained, and the staff are knowledgable and caring."
"We visited jurong bird park with family and a toddler. At the entrance itself, you are able to take buggy cars for kids at a rental. Or you may take the tour bus. Food is available at various cafes within the park. Must see the hawk show and parrot show at the amphitheatre. Also must experience feeding the lories in the Australia section. Recommended for all ages as it is a totally different experience and really worth visiting. The park opens at 8:30 am and takes about 4-5 hours to cover the entire park; time may change if you have small kids :)"
"Very nice garden and all the birds are healthy very good friendly happy to see them, we spent all day walking here, love this place"
"If you are a bird enthusiast or a passionate about photography then this is the place to be. The facility is superb for observing birds up close and brushing up on bird trivia. You can feed exotic birds in an aviary, and feed yourself at the cafe or restaurant at the park. Motorised electric vehicle available for the elderly to cover the long distance at a nominal cost of $20 for 2 hours"
"This bird park is outside of the city to the west, and is well worth a visit. I have never seen so many diverse and colourful types of birds in one location. The layout of the park is impressive. There are the open air enclosures with pelicans, the closed enclosures with hawks, and the walk through enclosures of huge proportions with other diverse birds. I definitely recommend that you add this to one of the places to visit when in Singapore, because I doubt whether you will find anywhere better. A practical tip, not advertised in any guidebook that I have seen, is that if you arrived in Singapore by Singapore Airlines you get 10% off the admission price, but you need to produce your boarding pass (the electronic version is fine)."
"Nearly every park we went to in Singapore had a show, but Jurong's blew the rest out of the sky! Was a really cool mix of funny bird acts that kept the kids laughing."
"Visiting Jurong Bird Park in Singapore is a family-friendly adventure, to see various bird species, from parrots to penguins. You can also ride the 'Panorail' (in air-conditioned comfort) for a panoramic look at the bird park.Set on 50 acres (20 hectares) of verdant green space, Jurong Bird Park is home to thousands of birds across hundreds of species. We can enjoy quality family-time at the various attractions, such as the 'Birds & Buddies' show, which runs twice a day and features characters in colourful costumes. We need to check the show schedule at the park when we arrive, as other shows too take place during the day.We stopped by the African wetlands exhibit to see African birds in their habitat of ferns, palms and native-style pavilions and learnt about the environmental balance in which birds and humans both live. We also entered a misty jungle-style habitat at the Waterfall Aviary. We didn't miss the penguin exhibit, which features an underwater viewing gallery to watch the penguins. We were able to feed fish to the penguins in the open arena on the opposite side.We watched the show ""Birds of Prey"", featuring vultures, hawks, owls, etc., beautifully trained and handled by the Park attendants. The next show was called ""High Flyers"", featuring multi-coloured Parakeets and Macaws, performing flying feats, and showing amazing skill by flying through loops and obeying the commands of their trainers. One Macaw was able to recite songs in Chinese and call out numbers from one to ten in three languages!! It was a tremendous experience, to be specially enjoyed by young and old. The finale was a grand parade of Pelicans and Flamingos!It is truly astounding that the trainers have shown patience and spent countless hours training these birds.A ""NOT TO BE MISSED"" visit!"
You must go and see this the bird park is just wonderful and the show they put on is out of this world . Well done Jurong Bird Park
"Jurong bird does not have a direct train or bus . taxis are cheaper in singapore . you can see the whole park in about 2 hrs ,but the show timings are spread throughout the day .Make sure you get there on time so you don't miss the shows .The park has restrooms and water area where drinking water can be filled . Tram ride needs the entry ticket but you can hop on and off as many times as you wish ."
"This place is one of a kind. A special zoo for birds. A great collection of birds with some hard to find species like the dinosaurs descendants (I adore the emu and the cassowary) and close encounters with many of them. You can enjoy the shows of the Kings of the Sky the birds of prey like hawks, vultures and owls and the High Flyers show mainly the cute parrots. There is also a nice water-park for kids. You can also combine your ticket with other parks, the zoo, the night safari and the river safari, but these parks are not in the same area."
"Unless you actively hate birds, plan at least a short visit (but note that the aviaries are closed about 15 minutes before the official closing time). The aviaries are huge. One has a 30 metre waterfall inside of it and a bridge from which you can look down on the waterfall. There are a lot of rare birds here, and some good explanatory displays. I particularly liked the blue macaws - I had seen pictures of them, but until my visit, I had no idea they were nearly 1 metre long from their beaks to the tips of their tail feathers. Be warned; the stench from the bird droppings is also incredible - the bird population is packed into a much smaller space than in the wild."
"We visited Jurong Bird Park expecting to stay a few hours and ended up spending the whole day. What an amazing place. We visited with 3 adults and 2 children (6yo and 7yo) and there was something for everyone. The birds of prey show was particularly well done with some unique birds that you wouldn't normally encounter in this type of show. The bird park also so many collections of species you wouldn't see elsewhere (macaws, hornbills and toucans in particular. But if these highlights still aren't enough there is a vast collection of other birds on show. The area is bigger than we expected but there's a train that runs around the park. We walked most of it but took the train when it was time to go home. Also take bathers because there's a fantastic water playground where the kids can play and refresh themselves with some water play. Excellent change facilities available and if you forget the bathers you can buy at the shop at reasonable prices. But no bathers no play! All in all a fantastic day out. Well done Jurong Bird Park. Note that it's quite some way out of town. Not sure how you'd go getting there by public transport - we used Grab and were taken door to door."
"This place is away as compared to other sights ,.It is a very bib bird park spread over approx 20 Hectres of land .One can find almost all type of beautiful,large, small, coloured species from all over world. One should spend minimum 5 hours to have feel of the bird park. if one can not walk long ,hopping trams are available at nominal charge. There are beautiful shows which are not to be missed. One will find clean toilets and water for drinking fountains everywhere."
It was simply amazing. We enjoyed the Kings of the Sky show and the Pelican Chit Chat. The waterfall arena was simply amazing .....cannot do justice to this place with a few words because there were so many wonderful aspects. The aviaries have been done with so much thought to detail its just really wonderful. And as a bonus there is this huge play area for kids which allows parents to catch their breath after a long walk inside. But please remember to take your kids swim suits as otherwise they miss out on just one part of the play area...
Definitely worth the visit. Cab fare is about $20 from the city centre. Make sure you catch the bird show. Took my elderly parents who caught the free tram from. Point to point while we walked. You will need to walk to see all the displays. Takes about 4 hours to do the park if you walk. There is a steep hill to walk up during one section so keep that in mind with kids. Looking forward to seeing it again when it moves to the zoo precinct.
Huge collection of birds from across the world. Especially the predatory birds.All birds are very well trained.The predatory bird show is not to be missed.The main bird show is excellent.
"This is a bit out of the way from some other attractions but an easy taxi ride ( about $16S from Orchard Rd area) gets ou there in about 20 mins. Some amazing birds on display here (I never knew giant pigeons existed!) The two shows on offer showcase some amazing birds demonstrating some normal behaviours. The Macaws and raptors were very impressive. Use the tram to get around if you are a bit weary.(We used the Parkhopper Plus ticket for all 4 wildlife parks and it included the trams for all parks too, it is good value). Lots of meal options and snacks, a kids water playground and cafe too."
"Amazing collection of birds, with great attention to housing them in as natural an environment as possible. A huge emphasis on conservation. Don't miss the displays as they were great fun and hugely informative. Eateries are not why you go there, but you won't go hungry. The best is at the entrance but the staff in the others could not have been more professional and courteous. Friday, 10 Aug, we went to the cafe at Lory Loft - young lady working on her own, very busy, dealt with everyone calmly and professionally, and still made us feel welcome. My 8-year old god-daughter had to be dragged away - feeding the Lories was a highlight, though she was mesmerised by the displays too..."
"A must visit place in your iternary , parrots paradise was my favourite, do all shows and try to visit by trams, ask your tour operator to book it with tram only, you can stop at your favourite spot and hop on in another tram.Beautiful place with beautiful birds."
One of the most wonderful opportunities to connect with Nature. Very well maintained and you get to see the world of birds in a very friendly environment.
"We came here near closing time, about 5pm. Probably because of the time there were very few people, it was very tranquil. Stayed till almost 7pm, they close at 6pm, rangers didn't find us earlier. Need about 4 hours to see everything"
"Amazing is the word that comes to my mind when you see the variety of birds, the way they are taken care of in their near natural habitats, the young and enthusiastic staff, the bird shows and the entertainment that this place offers. My kids loved it, especially when they took photographs with pelicans and other birds."
Is enjoyable however the whether is too hot due to the whether. Nice show and is very educational . .
The bird park is really worth a visit. Huge scale and close-up access to the wildlife is amazing. Got some great photos.
"Even as a local, we visit JBP once a while too. In this visit, we brought a China student who was in a exchange program with our daughter to JBP as JBP is the largest bird-park in Asia. As a local, we see that JBP is working hard introducing new animals and did many revamps on the park. We enjoyed the new features (as what we saw previously were no longer around), and also the shows. We saw many tourists visiting the park but sadly, we the locals were very little. We hope JBP continue to work hard attracting our own peoples to visit the park."
oh u must visit this place and take a walk u can see the most exotic bird ever and can u blv there are more than 20 types of parrots and then the flemingos...its lovely live show there and its surely a park one must visit
A wide variety of birds in the open as well as in large netted areas. 2 shows of interest as well as bird feeding. Lovely to stroll around but a tram is available if preferred.
"Why Jurong Bird Park has been bring human being A bird life together over 40 years ago ? You can pick up the Mrt For Begin...than change A bus.. far away from City center but, the landscape All the way .. so Beautiful."
"The sheer number of species is unbelievable. Well maintained, visitor friendly, and excellent for the whole family. Plan to spend the whole day, but figure out the show times so that you can get the most out of it. Try to keep the noise down, we were disappointed that some visitors couldn't seem to remember that noise could make the birds uncomfortable."
"We love the bird show very much, especially my children. They enjoy to ride the tram go around the park. The flamingos and scarlets are lovely, beautiful color. Pizza is available inside the park, 1 big slice = 7 singapore dollar. We suggest the pizza staff to always control and clean up the table and chair for customers in outdoor. Anyway, Jurong bird park is extremely recommended place to visit. Thank you guys!"
Excellent facilities and so many beautiful birds. Especially the show held a few times a day was wonderful and exciting!
great enclosures for the birds. By the time you walk around all the enclosures and see the 2 bird shows you could end up spending the whole day here so dont start too late.
"Beside the fabulous singapore zoo,stopping by in jurong bird park is also a must. You will experience lots of various of birds and you will feel like in heaven especially when you hear the birds chirping or singing. Dont forget to watch the birds show too...."
It's a great place to see birds in somewhat natural habitat. There are more than 4000 birds. The shows and the chitchat are a must for those who are visiting the place. One should have all the timing details where they should be at what time so catch up with the beautiful shows they offer
"What a wonderful experience we had at the Jurong Bird Park. We were pleasantly surprised at the lush surroundings throughout the Park. Although stranded for about half an hour through a heavy downpour, this did not deter us once the skies had cleared, to walk the easy paths to each exhibit. There were magnificent species macaws, hornbills to be seen as well as the every-hungry lorikeets which demanded feeding. The flamingos and birds of prey were amazing, so to, the High Flyers Show and the Grand Finale was a showstopper!"
"The park is one of the best or I just say the only best one in the world. Clean, well planned and a great collection of birds from across the world. Dedicate a whole day so that you don't need to rush and also buy the tram ride tickets for sure."
"Just a joy to visit, food selection was good, easy to stroll and shows was very entertaining. Very friendly staff and service."
Jurong Bird Park is such a pleasure to visit. It has good signage to inform about the endangered status of many of the birds. The Park seems to have a good breeding program for endangered birds. The upgraded penguin exhibit was great. Our one year old grandson could get a good look at penguins swimming up close.
"We really enjoyed the whole trip, especially the bird shows. And we are so happy to see the pretty birds and penguins!"
"Brought my wife and kids to the jurong bird park on weekends and our whole family had a great time. There were many activities and shows available for the kids, and the service staff was attentive and provided good service. Weekends can get quite crowded with many people also visiting the park. Overall, a good experience!"
"We spent 5 hrs walking through the bird park and were pleasantly surprised and the quality of the park. They have done a great job with the animals, presentation of them and the surroundings that are in the park. (the waterfall was our favorite other than the birds)The bird park is being moved to a new location by the zoo in 2020 so get your visit in for the current location soon!"
"I am not a big bird fan, but this park was really good. So many different exotic birds, a huge beautiful aviary and a very large area to walk around and just enjoy the rainforest along with the free flying winged friends....I honestly didn't know there was more than one type of toucan. xD"
Visited there many times. Child likes here very much especially when feeding the bird in the park. Will come to visit again.
"Chicken pizza very nice food and legveni pasta good lava kayak, ice cream, coffee, chicken pasta, and storage all food is good"
"Absolutely wonderful !! Lush greenery, beautiful birds . DO not miss feeding the parrots. They are so friendly and beautiful. Highlight were the bird shows. Try to reach by 11.30, so that you can see shows at 3.30 and 4.30 ..They are must watch..Definitely a repeat attraction"
"An amazing and wide variety of birds will please the children and the elders alike.The shows are also interesting.Dont miss the feeding of the lorry lofts,its once in a lifetime experience.However the park is far away from central singapore (about an hour drive).Also finding a cab back is time consuming"
"The types of birds and the way they are trained are worth watching. This is one of its own kind of experience. Not only children, even elders like the Park."
Really nice park with beautiful birds and nice installations. We appreciated how we can see the birds in a natural environment.
"We almost did not go to Jurong Bird Park because the reviews on TripAdvisor were so mixed. We were glad we made the effort as it was an excellent day out.Getting there - we took the MRT (Boon Lay MRT) and then crossed over to the bus terminal and got the 194 bus which drops you off just outside the park (this is contrary to what Google Maps will tell you - it says to catch the bus from a different location; this is incorrect). It takes about 70-80 minutes to get to Jurong Bird Park from central Singapore.Layout - The park is well laid out and as it is situated on the side of a hill you do quite a bit of uphill and downhill walking. For those who do not want to walk around the park there is a tram that circles the park and costs $5 per adult for unlimited hop on hop off.The Park - We loved the shows, especially the High Flyers Show (sit in the middle just below half way if you want to have a good chance of being selected for audience participation), the Lory Loft where the birds sit on your arm, shoulders and head to get food or nibble at your cap and the Hornbills & Toucans display. The Parrot Paradise is also worthwhile. The Breeding & Research Centre and Bird Discovery Centre are also good (both are air conditioned and also provide interesting educational material and the chance to see birds being incubated and new hatchlings).We found the park to be clean and the bird cages were well maintained. There were plenty of staff all over the park ensuring that the surrounds were kept neat and tidy.Food & Water - There are a number of food outlets across the park and free water refill stations across the park so make sure you bring a water bottle with you. We had lunch at the Hawk Cafe which has a range of local food for around $8 - just remember to get a stamp to come back in after lunch as you access the cafe through the exit shop."
"It's a massive place that has over a hundred species of birds, most of which are free to roam around. Some birds are placed in cages, which was heartbreaking to see.However, the surroundings are natural.Take the tram when you're here. Otherwise, you're in for a long, long walk. Don't forget to enjoy the bird show. It was brilliant, to say the least."
It was a good experience in the bird park. Dont miss the bird shows...Its a must watch if you are visiting the Jurong Bird park. Plan your trip according to the timing of these shows..Enjoyed alot with my family.
"We got there by public transport and it was easy enough. We took the East-West MRT line and got off at Boon Lay, where we followed signs to the bus interchange and took Bus No. 194, which takes you to the front of the park.If you can, it's worth catching the shows. Token feeding (for S$2) of the African Penguins near the entrance was a highlight. We spend about 4 hours at the park.I bought the 4-in-1 park hopper ticket. I paired Jurong bird park with River Safari, followed by Rainforest Lumina (a separate ticket, not covered in the 4-in-1 ticket) in the one day. Looking back, I think it was a good decision.To get between Jurong Bird Park and Singapore Zoo, there is a shuttle for S$6pp, but the person at the stand (at front of the bird park) told us it only operates on the hour. We just missed one, so we were going to line up for the taxi, wanting to not waste time. The person at the shuttle stand, knowing that another couple was also going to the Singapore zoo instead to offered organise immediate transport to the zoo immediately for S$40 (S$20 per couple). We took it. The driver got us to Singapore zoo in less than 20 minutes.Remember to take an Umbrella."
I was travelling with my parents ages 75 and with my daughter aged 4 to singpore and visited hiring bird parkThis is a must seeAt the time I thought may be it would not be fun for meBut I was so wrong as I had a great time thereIt's made so beautiful insideThe lory loft and the ivory waterfall are the best sections.It was amazing.I got the feeding of the birds In the water fall section and also the feeding of the pelicansIt is recommended to do all the shows and feeding as you can interest with the birds at that time.It is a full day activity and do not club any thing else with this.The best part is that you can rent prams and an. Electric scooter so my father aged 75 did not need to walk at allHe could move in it every where even the pram was acessable thorough out the parkIt was truest age friendly for young children to senior citizensWheel chairs are available on hire tooThe cost of the scooter was 20 dollars for 3 hours and 5 dollars per hour there afterIt was a good experience and fun for all ages
"First time for me to see flamingo, penguin, pelican, and there's a whole lot more to see. Otherwise, I could only see them from Discovery channel and animal books. Bring your kids for them to enjoy birds and nature."
"Nice,big,distractive park.i enjoy it with my sister,mother and my son,was very nice for all of us.Also have many distractive for children,small pool,tram."
One of a good spot to spend a day with family or friends. Lots of species of birds from all over the world. Interactive and educative shows. You can even feed the birds at one of the enclosure as well. Highly recommended.
"The way to plan the itinary out for the visit is to first find out which are the shows and where . I was travelling with young kids and what we did was first took a tour of the whole place via the tram which gave us an idea of what are the different attractions in the place. ( You can get the same by the map as well but a quick tour gives a different perspective )* We mapped out the different shows that we wanted to see and made sure that we cover the adjacent areas and attractions.* Make sure that you get to feed the birds, its a wonderful activity :)Downside -The only downside was they had a kids playing area with fountains and swings for the kids. A part of the area was only accessible if the kids were wearing a swimming costume. The swimming Costumes over there were exorbitant and hardly any choice and we had a hard time explaining that to the kids."
"Our 1st trip to a bird park and I knew it had to be Jurong Bird Park! Check online for cheaper deals.Plan your trip before you go. The shows are dependant on weather so best to allocate the whole day there. You can do all the feedings as well as the 'chit chats' which are informative.The rare blue macaws are a sight to behold. Its critically endanged so.... Don't miss it!Before you leave, visit the Birds of Play for a wonderful session at the water play park! Bring change of clothes.Overall, thus place doesn't disappoint."
I don't know why but I could spend most of the day here. to compare with the price and everything that they have here I can say that it's worth the price. all the bird are amazing and look heathy.
"2 bird shows, Kings of the Skies and High Flyers Show, gave us quite marvelous experience in different aspect. It's highly recommended to attended."
Its fun for kids to see all the birds - theres a wet area too which kids can enjoy - the tram is a good choice to take since there a lot to walk otherwise.
"Had a lovely morning in the Bird Park. We enjoyed the Penguins and the Waterfall Aviary (much like everyone else!). Really nice to walk around - we bought the tram ticket and used it twice interspersed with walking.For visitors - note, we had only been in Singapore for 36 hours and it was really warm & humid which probably meant we left earlier than we did - its a long way from the centre of the city. Excellent MRT/Bus Interchange at Boon Lay."
"We started off early to be there at opening time 8.30am. MRT to Boon Lay then a bus from the Terminal to Jurong - this is well sign posted from the MRT. Although we had purchased tickets at Changi the ticket voucher still needed to be changed at the ticket office. We took the tram around the Park to give us an overview of the park as we had partially planned the day to include both the Bird of Prey and High Flyers Shows. We started at the Lory Loft the large free flying aviary - this was fabulous with lots of colourful birds flying and walking around the aviary. We were there at feeding time so were able to be very close to the birds, they flew onto our hand too. We saw lots of birds we hadn't seen before, it was great to learn that Jurong also does conservation work for endangered species like the Hyacinth Macaw - a beautiful bright blue Macaw. As we walked around the Park we stopped by the Keepers who gave talks about the birds under their care. Times are well signposted for these talks. The Hornbill and Toucans are fascinating birds !!The two bird shows were excellent particular the Birds of Prey which featured Eagles,Hawks and Vultures.The Waterfall Aviary is beautiful with lots of birds wandering and flying about. The Waterfall walk takes you both below and above the waterfall - great place for photos.You will need a minimum of 4 hours ( includes Shows ) to have a good look at what is at the Park."
Nice place to visit..i visited there first time even though it was memorable. Best place for bird lover.. Must visit in lifetime..
"Its a perfect place to spend the day in Singapore. There a large variety of birds to see (variety of Horn Bills is especially impressive) and very informative especially for the kids. You get a taste of little bit of wilderness and its difficult to believe that you are smack in centre of a bustling city. There are shows all day round, its recommended that you pick and choose which one you want to see and plan accordingly. There is tram to roam around in the park. Tram is more like a fun ride rather than a means to move around in the park since the area of park is not too large to walk. Tram ride is recommended and our ticket that we got from Klook.com included the tram ride. Bird show at 'Pools Amphitheatre' is must see, plan your activity around this. We could also see 'Horn bill' show which was very informative and the lady giving the information was too good. Reserve at least 4-5 hours for this attraction but you can easily spend a day here if you have time. Facilities inside Park are very good including toilets, drinking water and also food."
"I have a bird phobia so it was with some trepidation that I accompanied my husband and bird mad 18 year old on a day trip to the Jurong Bird Park. I was won over - I held rainbow lorikeets, a macaw and I think I might be partially cured!We choose to do the ""Lunch with the Birds optional extra where we had a lovely buffet lunch then a private bird show. To our surprise there were only 4 of us at the show. That meant my son got to be the volunteer for every activity - and interacted with all sorts of birds. It was a trip highlight for him.Beware of the extremely high costs for photos with the birds. We paid anyway because who usually has the chance to hold a macaw?The birds are amazing and the park does a lot in terms of conservation. Highly recommended. We went on a Monday and there were no queues."
There is no type of bird species which is not you will not find in the sanctuary. it is one of the best place of the city
exotic birds are available in Jurong Bird Park. an experience to go ... the bird shows are brilliant and beautiful
"I had bought the pass for the 4 wildlife parks in Singapore, including the trams. I had not planned to see the bird park but since I bought the pass which included it - I planned a short visit. To my incredible surprise, it was my favourite of the parks! Incredible birds in a beautiful setting, the pinnacle being the waterfall enclosure which surprised me at how such a large area was still enclosed for the birds safety, but it felt like it was entirely in the wild! My only complaint was the bars that get in the way of some picture taking, some of the birds were in large enclosures but thick bars are in the way of the viewer. The age of the park is most likely part of the issue, but having some plexiglass or a lighter style bar would be nice for viewers. Especially regarding the Hornbills (so many types!)It was rainy when I started my day... rather it was a downpour. So an umbrella plus a rain poncho were needed. There are not many spots to sit out a rain... but the birds were staying still and some were bathing in the rain, so it was good viewing regardless of the weather!The tram was a great way to get my bearings as to how the park is laid out... I rode the full route as it was pouring rain and I was killing time, turned out that it was a wonderful preview. Do not try to get pictures from the tram as it goes too fast, but pay attention to the sights it points out as these are great to get pictures of while you walk the route.Do not forget to bring money as it is 100% worth the few dollars to feed the Lory's at the Lori Loft. These bright colourful birds are a crowd favourite and will land on you to get the nectar from cups you hold. Both young children and adults get joy out of this experience!The enclosures where you can walk through and see the birds run and fly about are fabulous. The sounds and sights were memorizing. The nursery was wonderfully set up so you can see the process from eggs hatching to babies.I ended up staying the entire day at this park, a definite have too amongst Singapore's sights!"
"This place is definitely huge with a large assortment of birds and parakeets to view. A worthy place to go to if you are into nature, birds and photography as JBP has very much to offer for the peace and quiet-seeker who just wanted to escape the hustle and bustle of city life in Singapore. Price may be quite hefty but they do upkeep the place pretty well and is packed with bite-sized information and you can quite notice that the birds are well taken care of. Learnt a great deal of information from the park."
This was our first point of visit among the four parks. we bought the parkhopper pass from here after giving the date for night safari at the time or buying this hopper pass . \we reached around 11 am and it was very hot and humid .picked a map and started seeing the sights . please plan your visit in such a way that the shows are also not missed. there are two show King of the skies and high flier show both are very good .Allow yourself minimum 5-6 hours to be spend in the bird park .\we finished at the parks closing time of 6pm.if you missed the lunch after you exit from park you can go to curry garden restaurant attached to the bird park where indian food is served . We found out that after the park closing hours taxis are scarce . so you can just walk to the main road and catch the bus to boonlay terminus . from there you can catch mrt to your acomodation .
"Jurong bird park is one of the iconic tourist destinations of Singapore known for it's extensive collection of birds and especially Blue macaws. This place is quite big and you can spend around 3-4 hours of your time. Try not to miss the shows as they are very interesting and entertaining. Try to wear light clothes as you might have to walk a lot. Always stay dehydrated. The parrot collection is beautiful and the waterfall is a beautiful sight to watch. You can see peacocks roaming around. Overall, you must definitely visit this place as rare birds and such large collection is very hard to find in other parts of world."
"Amazing for kids, specially if you can catch the special shows. Suggested to have the trum ride inside. Take your time to travel around as there is a lot to explore. Bird cages are amazing and kids will love it!"
"It was my 2nd time to go to Jurong Bird Park. This time around, the kids were with my wife and I. They had fun looking at the different birds and the shows. Tip: Bring your own water bottle (they have water dispensers around the park) and an umbrella or two (you don't want the rain to spoil your time around the park). Take the tram to cover more area faster (especially if you're with elderly people or very young kids). You can just hop off the hop on again to a different area."
"Need to spend a day fun filled, entertaining, with family and friends, cost effective? This is one among the few places in Singapore. Don't miss it, kids as well as adults would love the bird feeding session."
"I have never seen so many different birds in the one place....Beautiful Birds from all over the world. Even if you are not into Birds so much, this place is definately worth a visit."
"One of the best places for bird lovers in Singapore. I spend about 8hrs.Timings are 9am- 5:30-6pm, weekdays are the best if you don't want the crowd. Check out the bird shows are go half an hour prior the show to get good seats. Worth waiting extra to watch it.There are trams inside which take you to different stops and you can get off at any stop look around and get back onto another tram.Food and beverages available inside the premises at decent rates.Kids will enjoy this place and so will adults and senior members.Loads of birds are seen, and you can feed parrots too, thoroughly enjoyed every minute.Bird shows -Experience -Maintenance -Food Price - $$$ (Medium priced)"
Second largest Aviary in the World. Unlimited variety of Birds from around the Globe can be found here.Several shows are held daily with well trained birds. Quality of training is simply unbelievable. Birds perform unimaginable feats.Desire to come back can't be controlled.
Best place to go for bird lovers... the kind of birds specially Macau's you see here is exceptional. They birds are well kept inside large enclosures so that they dont feel suffocated and seemingly are happy... bets place for Kids to get the first lesson in bird varieties across the world...dont miss the Flamingo's
Both the flyer high show and Kings of the Skies show are impressive! These were the first time our family have ever seen in our life. Good work. Good trainers! Keep on the hard work. And protect the birds. Thank you.
"It was great time spend at bird park, the bird show & overall arrangements were very good. One improvement area one of the soft drink dispensing machine near the tram station & parrot area was accepting money but not dispensing, no response on given contact number also, all machines should be checked on regular basis"
"I visited this place with my adult daughter and 8 year old granddaughter. We could have stayed much longer than 6 hours, but we were limited by the little one's energy level. We enjoyed the penguin feeding and the birds of flight show, highlighting the macaws, toucan, pelicans, flamingos etc.The Lory Loft was our highlight where we could purchase a liquid feed and feed the colourful lorikeets, which often landed on our outstretched arms without fear!Personally I enjoyed the flamboyant flamingos with their long skinny legs.They also had a water theme park area where little ones could cool down and regain energy and enthusiasm to continue with the park. A definite place to stop and cool down if travelling with kids.A must for anyone who loves birds.Don't forget your water bottleBring swimming gear"
"I have visited Jurong Bird Park many times, still very good to bring my son and Daughter here..They like the Bird park.."
"Very nice place, easy to move around extremely children friendly. Staff extremely cordial.Lots of option for F&B.Will visit another time"
This is one of the best place to visit lovely birds. One can witness colorful birds. Feeding the parakeet is the best experience if one visits this place.
"My visit to the Jurong Bird Park of Singapore was one of the top highlights of my trip. The park has a wide collection of bird species from around the world and many shows throughout the day that highlight some of the birds. There is a tram, for a small extra fee, which makes loops around the somewhat large park, which is helpful. The most impressive area of the park to me was the waterfall aviary, which is the second-largest walk-in aviary in the world. The ""lory loft"" is a popular area, which allows an interaction with many lorikeets through feeding (small cups of sugar water can be purchased). The Jurong bird park is delightful and absoloutely one of the best aviary experiences I've ever had. I only had 4 hours in the park and wished I had longer, but I LOVE birds. Other people may be fine with less time. Such a special place!!"
Birds are segregated into different zones. Saw many rare birds. Many shows were conducted. They were enjoyable. Kids enjoyed feeding lorikeets. There is a good Indian restaurant. There were huge queues for the tram as they were limited in number.
Birds galore and easy to get to even though it's outside downtown. Take the MRT to the stop where there is a connecting bus (2 stops past the Jarong MRT stop). Well done. Be sure to take lots of water as it can be hot and much walking is required. There is one refreshments area where the birds fly all around you and land on shoulders and heads. Great photos and fun for all. We only wish some of the cages were larger.
"I have to admit that walking into the park and finding tons of flamingoes didn't bode well for my visit. But once I got past those, the rest of the park was great. The parrots and macaws, the waterfall aviary, the toucans and hornbills, the dinosaur descendants and the pelicans were all fantastic areas as were many smaller things in between. If you have any interest in birds - or maybe even if you don't think you do - the bird park is well worth a visit."
"Great attraction, many variety of bird , the tram will took you to 4 station , each station you can disembark and enjoy the attraction nearby"
This place offers a wide range of birds. the shows here are too much fun. kids will for sure enjoy a lot. the place is such peacefully built that inside various arenas you actually get the feeling of being in the forest inside bird's shelters.
"What a lovely place, so clean and such beautiful birds, so colorful. Loved the Flamingos! Keep up the good work."
"The shows were entertaining and educational to children. Clean and good place for stroll. If stroll is not your thing, the tram ride is good too."
"As a proud Singaporean, Jurong Bird Park is another world class standard tourist site that is home to thousands of feathered species- bird kingdom.Besides clean, interactive and well fed/ maintained birds, service, food and other attractions have exceeded expectations. Lori Loft, Wild Birds encounters, Parrot Paradise are the top three must visit areas. Well done, Wildlife Reserve Singapore and Jurong Bird Park Team for your excellent effort!!"
"This is truly a paradise for birds and bird lovers. The Singapore government is doing a lot to save endangered birds. They have a breeding and research centre where eggs and chicks are nurtured. You can see a wide range of colourful birds, including the rare blue macaw here.The Waterfall Aviary with a 30 metre high waterfall is a refreshing sight. This is supposedly the world's largest walk-in aviary with over 600 free-flying birds.You can take a tram ride but it's best to explore the place on foot because the trams don't cover the interior regions."
"We visited Jurong Bird Park in May 2018.Its a beautiful park, vibrant with colorful birds.We started with the Penguin Coast. Housed in a ship-shaped building, you can find four species of penguins suitably cooled in the air-conditioned Penguin Coast exhibit ' the Humboldt, the Macaroni, the King Penguin and the 'spikey-haired' Rockhopper. Beside them, a a flock of contented-looking puffins nest on 'rocky cliffs'.There are a couple of shows one can watch, We enjoyed the High Flyer Show, it was an interactive show of around 30 minutes. High Flyers Show features Jurong Bird Park's birdy stars. From hornbills to parrots, and pelicans to flamingos, the High Flyers Show entertains visitors with brightly-coloured and charming feathered talents. Look out for 'personalities' like Sassy the Cockatoo and Amigo the Yellow-naped Amazon Parrot.We included a Tram ride, as it was convenient to tour the entire place.Our son enjoyed the Birdz of Play - A must-stop spot for the kids. Take a break from the birds and have some fun at this colorful playground. The wet play area has a shallow pool for kids to cool off in, and a play structure complete with a tipping bucket dunking gallons of water to those beneath it.Overall, a must visit place."
"Jurong Bird Park, for me is very nice.There are a couple of shows one can watch, We enjoyed the High Flyer Show, it was an interactive show of around 30 minutes.There are many flamingos in Flamingo Lake. There is a beautiful aviary called Waterfall Aviary. There are several observation points in the aviary that give different views of the waterfall.one can spent several enjoyable hours in the park, It is absolutely beautiful. There is a lot to see and do there. We enjoyed the park very much."
"Visited on a Sunday morning..it is in one corner of Singapore but well connected by MRT, Bus n Cabs..it is better to buy entry tickets online as it is cheaper..so many varieties of Birds,Ducks,Parrots,Pelicans, Penguins..of all sizes n colours..you can buy feeds & give it to the birds..plenty of greenery, water & trees...aviaries are fairly big..However, I felt parrot cages are small..also took a paid tram ride inside the Park.. plenty of walking to do..hence wear your Keds, hat & carry water...there is a 100feet high waterfall... bathing is not permitted...A must see tourist spot in Singapore."
I love birds and there are some amazing ones in this park and I visit each time I go to Singapore. It's a vast area but there is a little run around buggy-train that drives around the park to get you to some of the further spots without needing to walk. Make sure you see the shows - the birds are great and the staff clearly care a lot about them.
The park shows and birds are well maintained and kids can enjoy the vibrant colors of the birds. You can now convert your one day ticket to annual subscription membership which will allow unlimited access during weekdays.Go get it now!
"Get close view of the birds... try your photography skills here... kids play area, breeding center and lory loft are my recommendation...and amphitheater.."
The amphitheater show is the main attraction here. The birds on this show are unbelievably trained and it is one of very few exotic animal shows left in the world
As you enter you get to see penguin which I dream of and wanted my kids to see the beautiful birds different kinds of parrot and Honolulu birds the show of vultures owl eagles was awesome they fly above your head and another show of birds parrot and Honolulu was and awesome experience must visit but take 3 hours time to do so
"This is my second visit to the Jurong Bird Park and it did not disappoint. Although we got caught in a thunderstorm, I am so glad that I got to visit this park again. Lovely collection of birds from around the world. It is well presented, clean and it's obvious that the birds are well cared for."
"good place to be with family and kids. all flora and fauna under single place across the globe. more educative not only to children, but to all. a must itinerary in your Singapore package"
"Visited the Park with a group of families. It is a marvel to see so many birds in a eco friendly park. You get to see a varied variety of birds ranging from Flamingos, Hornbills, Penguins, Lory Loft, doves, pigeons etc.The best way to visit the park would be to take the tram to Tram Station 3 or 4 and then walk down to admire how the different types of birds gel into the beauty of nature. Please note that the park organizes a bird show as fixed time, which is a must see and you must plan your travel as per the timings of the bird show."
A pleasant experience by my family and the little 7 month old tiny tot who had fun at the birds park.The lorry loft was a good experience. Where you have birds trying to perch on our shoulder. And specially never should w miss the shows organised by the park.
A very large collection and display of birds .Actually Birds of all feathers..so to say.A colourful place to spend some time knowing about bird facts.Rare blue macaws were the highlight.Recommended.
We visited on a rainy dayThe crowd was above averageThe team ride explained the whole parkWe had time scarcity so we did not get downWe saw a large no of birds playingExcellent fountains as well as groups of pink Flamingos alsoWe ended up with the Bird Show in the AmphitheatreThis was by Jove a great show to watch
"Some of the areas you should not miss in this park, the man made water fall, tallest in the world, as claimed by park authority, Penguin feeding, and live shows"
"Had wonderful time with family, my kid loved it absolutely, it was raining when we went so we took rain coats from the counter and walked in the rains, had so much fun seeing closely different species birds, must visit for family with kids."
"Had a wonderful & pleasant day at the Jurong park....Colorful birds, courteous staff, excellent shows for all group age, nice food, free tram service within the bird park (Queue is long).It's all day activity, you won't get bored when you visit bird park. I haven't seen so many different kinds of birds anywhere in the world. Excellent shows, great display, beautiful & coloful birds!Try to visit early morning as there are many shows which are held during the start of the day, and it's less crowded.Had fun & a memorable day. A must visit for everyone coming to Singapore. I ended up all day (7hrs approx) when my initial plan was just 2 hrs. Singapore tourism at it's best."
"It was a great experience, kids had a good time and enjoyed very much. Missed the shows due to time constraints."
"Had an excellent day yesterday with family at the Bird Park with Singapore tourism at its best. Interacted with many people at the Park through the day and all, very cordially held out a helping hand when called upon. To call out a few ' the lady bus driver on bus 194 that got us there (sorry, didn't catch her name) was cheerfully helpful, Vincent at the Pizza Hut counter was efficient and served a butter-dripping warm garlic bread and a wicked cup of coffee (perfect accompaniment as the weather was a bit damp in the morning, but cleared later), and Logan at the photo counter was professional as well as charming with all members of my family (he got my six year old son to stand still, pose with birds in hand and smile ' all at the same time ' for the camera!).Thanks all for an enjoyably memorable day."
"Expected to spend 2 hours here ...ended up staying 7 hours. So much to see. Incredible shows, beautiful displays. GREAT day out"
"One of the best collections of birds in Singapore for many years. It will not fail to amaze anyone who loves birds. Rare birds like birds of paradise, eagles and vultures abound. The enclosed aviary have free flying birds while you walk amongst them. It's an experience not to be missed unless you are afraid of birds after watching Alfred Hitchkok 's movie."
"My uncle and aunt came from Toronto, Canada. I brought them to Jurong bird park. We really enjoyed the visit. Especially on the bird show, we could participate as a show member.Thanks for the memories!!"
You can photo with many birds. Instagramable place. Many variants and colorful birds. There are rare birds also
I wanted to visit this place more than my son. When you visit this place you realise that how fascinating the world of birds are . We did parrot feeding that was quite interesting. Also we saw some shows that gave us glimpse of how birds react.
"you may be reading my reviews about other places of singapore in this forum. let me tell you something. of all the tourist places i visited in singapore, this is the only place where the stafff were warmth and not having any scowlon their face and were addressing the tourists' questions patiently. everywhere else the people were very rude and were using harsh words. the birds collection here is stupendous. i liked the penguin section and the flamingos really. the man-made waterfalls is an excellent photo-shoot place. the bird-show is worth watching once."
Jurong bird park is a must visit place when anyone plan for a trip to Singapore. You can see different variety of birds and that too in huge numbers. People visiting this place need to check the show timings ahead so that they don't miss it. The show was lovely and everyone irrespective of age will enjoy watching it!!
This is an amazing place for kids a lot to learn. Well maintained and extremely friendly staff. A must visit location in Singapore
"Really enjoyed the visit to Jurong Bird Park, it was absolutely brilliant..... The baby loved it specially the shows and the up close experience with the birds, it was indeed a memorable one...."
Another beautiful place to visit in Singapore. We caught the train to this area and then a short bus ride to the Bird Park. The park itself is quite extensive with a huge array of birds. It was worth the visit.
"One of the best bird park I have visited. Friendly staff, very well maintained enclosures, clean and hygenic bird enclosures, clear and precise signages and good bird shows"
"Jurong Bird Park was recommended to us by a friend and although our visit was interrupted by a huge storm, we still managed to make it around the whole park. The setting is beautiful and it's easy to get around on foot or on the shuttle. We only caught the end of one show and didn't see any others because of the weather, but what we saw was great. Unfortunately, we also missed out on the kids' water play, but that would have been great on a dry day. I highly recommend visiting the bird park for a unique day out."
"Excellent family destination. Very well organised. Make sure that you do not miss the shows, specially the High flyers show."
Its awesome experience. Well planned shows and activities. Very clean and informative.Very good for teens and adults.Must to visit !!!
"This is one of the best bird park i have seen.... Park is awesome, very clean. the bird show is excellent one should not miss this one."
"Very good shows, lots of variety, 100 ft waterfall, excellent and entertaining staff, Lots of drinking water points"
"In fact, we visited it again to enjoy the 3pm & 4pm bird shows which is a must watch. Everything is kept so clean & neat."
try and get in earlier in the day to avoid the heat when the birds are more active and as well as that you can see the feeding - either morning or late afternoon but the humidity builds up during the day.....
bird show was clever - good place for families. interesting to see some more unusual tropical birds.
"A lovely day was had. The park is very well designed, with great themed areas such as the waterfall. Will return!"
The bird park is gorgeous ! Definitely worth a visit . We loved the flamingos . Easy to get to by train .
Singapore is a very nice place to visit and enjoy with your family. It has tons of places for kids and family members to visit with.
"Never ever seen so many birds at one place. The park is fantastically made with birds clustered as per the families / species they belong too. They have shows going on in the park which are not to be missed. We particularly liked the morning show in the amphitheater with birds performing various tricks.Though taxis are there, the park is well connected with the MRT system, need to reach 'Boon Lay' station on the Green line and there a bus 194 from there that takes you directly to the JBP. They are planning to shift the bird park near to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari region in next 1-2 years i understood."
"It's a treat for nature lovers. The place is spread out but worth the walk. You can even take the tram. Very well maintained, clean and visitor freindly. A must see."
One of our best ways to spend a weekend. My 4 and 7 yrs old loves the lory loft where they get to feed the many colourful birds. I personally love the show at the Pool Amphitheatre where Lynn provides such great entertainment and insights into the bird keepers world.
"I never knew penguins can swim so fast till I visited Jurong! My daughter was thrilled to learn about the eggs, nests, beaks, bones of different birds in the Discovery Center. The army of flamingoes and pelicans were the highlight of the park. Please don't miss the shows that happen at different times of the day. We had lunch with the parrots which was a great experience. You get to hold them, take pics and even take home one of the paintings done by a Macao named Pikasso"
This was our second visit to the Bird Park. They will be moving the Bird Park soon next to the other Wildlife Reserve parks so it will be more convenient. We had lunch with the parrots although the food was just ok the show was Fantastic my two boys 3 and 7 absolutely loved it. The park seems massive but can be easily seen on foot. The waterfall open Aviary is the most beautiful part of the park. The penguin exhibit is a big hit with the kids my kids spent almost an hour looking at the penguins we also saw there feeding session Indoor and feed them ourselves in the outside exhibit which the kids also loved. It's a lovely place to walk around and look at amazing birds with a lot of convince very stroller friendly. If you have young children you will love the lazy strolling around the park with fun stuff for the kids to keep them busy.
Great place to visit especially with kids.Nice shows and informative trip.carry bottles of water cap and sunscreen if you plan to visit during Apr- may.
"Loved the bird park. Enjoyed the shows. Be sure to visit the area where you can feed the birds, great fun"
We revisited Jurong after over ten years away. It was even better than we remembered. Our favourite activity was feeding the lorikeets but we also enjoyed the spectacular colourings of the birds around the park and in the walk-in aviary.
We enjoyed all through bird park. Birds are Kept very well and taken care of them. It's just entrance fee is lil high.
Wonderful place and must to visit. I completely enjoyed the different types of birds and colors of birds. And the show was fabulous.
"One of the most beautiful things about Singaporeans is that they take immense care of their biodiversity. The Jurong Bird Park is full of marvellous birds and flying species and will leave you stunned. You can interact with these beautiful birds and learn more about their habitats, eating patterns, and even migratory patterns at various shows. You will also get a chance to feed the birds which is surely going to be a once in a lifetime experience! Start your day early because the Bird Park starts at 8.30 am and closes at 6.00 pm"
"Had a great day at the park. Better still, the ticket counter staff helped us convert our day ticket to a free annual pass! Thank you! Highly recommended place to visit and we will definitely be back!"
Jurong Bird Park was a highlight of our 2 week holiday. Its not so big that you exhausted at the end of the day and the tram is great for tired legs. We spent a long time in the Lorry Loft feeding the lorikeets. ($3 for food) The kids were amazed that the birds would sit on your arm or shoulder. The splash park at the end of the day was great for the kids so pack bathers!!
"A stunning Bird Park - at least 5 times bigger than the one in KL - with lots of walk through aviaries, and excellent bird shows with clever parrots etc. We were here from about 10.00 am to 3.00 pm, as lots to see. I understand that in about 2020 it will move to next to the Zoo and be even bigger, but well worth getting a 30 minute taxi (about S$25) each way to this now."
"3rd visit with our grandchildren..always exciting, always excited! Excellent layout & facilities and there always seems to be something new to experience!"
"nice ambience, kids love how some of the birds just roam by near them. they get to learn the traits of birds via displayed information and some audio as wel.."
"We loved the bird park and thought that it big, beautiful and lovingly cared for. I am not a fan of birds in cages but these birds had really large enclosures. The main show was very well done and thoroughly enjoyed seeing the birds swooping around. The only drawback for the show was the woman presenter's voice which was a little annoying along with her constant nervous laugh - otherwise a great show."
You ride the mrt and go down to boon lay station ride a bus in my recollection its c9 or ask the staff what is the bus going to jurong bird park the transportation is very easy our entrance ticket includes tram ride would suggest to do this if you have kids with you or you can walk all the way this is the largest bird paradise in asia i guess and there is a lot of attractions. And food and souvenir shops inside you can bring your bottle water for this activity i suggest you go early so you can tour around and watch all the program in the afternoon. And a close encounter to all the birds
"A word of advice - wear comfortable shoes as the park is huge and will take you all day to get through it. There are numerous different bird species. A lot of these birds, you'd only ever see, when you watch ""David Attenborough's Nature Shows""!! If you love colourful birds and exotic birds, this is a place to go."
"We booked our ticket online, we opted for a 2park option and also visited the Zoo. Was easy travel to the park by MRT & bus thus no need to pay for taxi. The park was great! They even had birds near the entrance for a photo shoot. We managed to watch the 2 bird shows of the afternoon. Overall was a day well spent with loads of memories."
"Though quite far from the city limits, bard park is a must visit for kids especially. The loads of fun that one gets during the shows is an experience. Loved the macau, kite flamingo shows. The aviary gives you an opportunity to learn more about birds, hatching, feeding and growth phases. Staff is very helpful. has an open kids play area with good restaurants and amenities."
So much fun we spent a full day here and so much to see. I think we enjoyed even more than the zoo. Pay for your tickets online and it's much cheaper to see this and the zoo together or see the night safari for half the price when gotten together
"Stress releasing watching birds, relaxed with cart travels and long walk; Excellent food, shops and amenities."
"Totally love the high flyer show! ITS A MUST WATCH or you'll miss out big time. Lory Loft was amazing too. Aside from that, the staff was friendly and helpful. Despite having 2 young children in stroller, its easy to get around the park."
"Between birds and animals, birds are more exuberant than animals. Most animals at the zoo are sleeping. Birds is aviaries are always active. That's the difference between birds and animals which make bird shows particularly exciting and fun filled. Kudos to having a bird park - always enjoy trips there."
This was my third visit to the Jurong Bird Park and everytime it is equally enjoyable. My kids love it too.
"Must watch attraction! Best when covered by foot. The expanse and the beauty of the park can be relished only when we walk through tge entire trail slowly and absorb the scenic beauty in every section. The Waterfall place and the ecosystem around it is simply beautiful. All in all, this park is definitely worth a wholesome visit."
"This bird park is amazing! I try to stay away from zoos and bird parks because in the past I have found the birds and animals in bad condition. This park is the best I have ever seen, the enclosures are massive with lots of enrichment. The two shows are very interesting as well, the best I've seen. It also started raining in the high flyers (3pm 12/4/18) and the handler/ presenter handled it so well! She moved the birds out of the rain into the crowd and continued the show! I really have to commend her quick thinking and her confidence. The later show was good as well and the presenter was so enthusiastic with his facts. There was lots to lean within the park which I enjoyed. I spent three hours here would of spent probably 30 mins to and hour more if the park wasn't closing. You can feed and interact with lots of animals ( we fed the penguins at 3:30) for such a good price of $2!.I think they need to remove products that have palm oil, I saw some in the shop near the waterfall (tao kae noi seaweed snacks). As the park talks about habitat destruction etc."
"The park is small, and there is a small train.Walking with young children will be a little tired, because there will be hillsides.It's very important to plan ahead in advance, because we can't miss all kinds of birds performance.The performance of birds is very interactive and interesting.You and the children can take part in feeding Parrots.This makes the children excited."
"This park probably got one of the diverse birds collection in the world including pet, wild, prey and extinct (I guess) variety. In addition to look these birds closely, the park authority organize two birds show: one with pet and other with prey birds in two different places within the park compound. These comes free when you buy entry ticket."
"We took the kids to see the Jurong Bird Park and although we had earlier planned to spend half a day, we ended up spending the entire day here as thee was so much to see and do. The bird park is well maintained and surprisingly clean. You will see some amazing collection of birds and the colors are spectacular. You can also fee the birds and take pics with them. Enjoy the experience."
"Had a weekend alone so thought I would visit the park with my camera alone. The forecasty was for afternoon so I decided to go to the park early to avoid this and the crowds and am glad I did. The mood was relaxing around the park at 9am when I arrived and I was able to check out a number of birds and take photos with no other people in them. I loved the immersive areas and the free range bird areas although I am not a fan of birds in cages so avoided most of the parrots. The shows were incredible though, especially the vultures in the birds of prey show. The staff are all very knowledgeable and they really push the conservation message which is great, even promoting bringing reusable water bottles and places to fill up on the way. The park is large but I managed to walk it in 3 hours without having to rely on the train which was pretty busy during the mid morning, The penguins were gorgeous and the puffins great to see and I loved the beautiful pink spoonbills and duck varieties. There are certainly a large array of birds! There are a couple of food places but I didn't eat and also toilet facilities dotted around. Had a great day and will be back again., Thanks!"
We had a lovely day out at the bird park so much to see. The indoor aviary and waterfall were a major highlight. Only issue is it isn't that accessible - need to get an Uber
"Jorong Bird Park is lively, colourful, and well-maintained. The aviaries are large and lush, giving the birds plenty of space to fly. We loved both bird shows. It's a great deal to have your 1-day pass converted into a year pass with no extra charge. I highly recommend it!"
My family and i with two young kids visited the jurong bird park on the 5th of april 2018. Watched the shows and we simply loved both shows. Especially the High flyers show. We watched both the 11 and 3pm show.Both the presenters did an awesome job. Managed to see different kinds of birds compared from the 11am and 3pm such as the hornbill part.My kids had too many questions that they went down to ask the presenter. Both the ladies( couldn't remember their names. Oops) were very patient and answered my children's ridiculous questions in a kiddy way. Will definitely recommend the bird park and the High flyers show. Will be back again.
We spent a good 4 hours here. The shows are really good and the Hornbill Chat was outstanding. It is just a keeper with his bird explaining about them and answering any questionsYou need to plan your time here because there is lots to see and many of the specific activities are worth attending. Spend some time when you first get there to figure out what order to see the various birds and activities so you can maximise your experience.The array of birds is expansive.We went by MRT and connecting bus service which is perfectly synchronised. We took a shuttle service from there to the Zoo which cost $6.00. Not bad value considering the alternatives and how much time it saves.
Such a beautiful setting for watching birds. You can watch feedings & bird shows. All are well spaced out so you can attend them all if you plan it right. I really enjoyed the waterfall aviary. Spent at least an hour in there. So many free-ranging birds to see. All the exhibits are easy to get to. Plenty of bathrooms and water spots around the park.
"Went on 24/03/18 with my 6 yr old girl. She had lots of fun at the water play area. The day we went, they had Easter activities and Meet and Greet with Peter Rabbit. Had fun around the area collecting colour easter eggs as well to exchange for gifts, face-painting and art & craft. Fun day for both of us."
"We enjoyed it a lot when visiting Jurong Bird Park a week ago. We went there in the morning to catch the King of the Skies Show and High Flyers Show. They were spectacular shows that everyone should see, how the birds were trained and treated so well there. The penguins also look amazing!Thank you to the trainers, staff, and everyone who contribute to keep the birds' population so we still could see many of them that we haven't seen, and also my kids can learn and appreciate nature more."
We started at 9am and we were done only at about 1.30pm! Overall it was an enjoyable experience despite the hot sun.Pretty lucky we had a good weather and there were too many people. Not sure if other people took this long to cover the entire park but my partner and I felt that this trip to the bird park was worthwhile :)
"Have visited several times as have a zoo annual pass.Parking out the front and accessible by taxi/grab.We prefer morning as can get very hot abs humid. Take a stroller from young ones or can hire a wagon. Lots of places to stop and have a break. Train available to ride for those who need a rest or have mobility issues. Pretty much attraction is flat with exception of some step inclines/stairs near enclosures.Bird enclosures are very well maintained, clean and birds look very well cared forMost shows on hold due to Covid restrictionsPark shop reasonably priced with discounts for zoo annual members"
Visited this bird park before its planned closure and shift to Mandai. I will miss this place. The old Lory Loft is overtaken by some other birds. The new Lory Loft is not as grand as before.
"Some of you might say, why bird park?But believe me this one is a good place to visit.My Aunt has a lot of birds, and some of them are even talking!This place is for people who loves to see variety of birds!the overall layout of the place was good too!"
"We visited Jurong Bird Park at a time when tourists have been largely absent from Singapore. Accordingly, the park was pretty deserted. But we've been visiting JBP for years and years and it never fails to excite. There can be no better time to visit than now when it's so quiet. And it's really worth supporting this fantastic place. Can't wait for the new home, which I'm sure will be terrific."
"Enjoyed our visit to this bird park very much, totally worth the trip, lots to see, great waterfall & shows were fun"
We are not bird people but it was included in our ticket for the zoo so thought why not go check it out. It was good for a bird park just a little out of the main city so we made the trip just for the park.
We caught the little train but could not see many birds from it so get off and walk into the exhibits to see the beautiful birds.
The bird park is an underground ride to Jurong and a bus ride from the station. Very easy. The park is well laid out and labelled. It is not flat but not mountainous.We caught the tram ride to get orientated and here was our only disappointment. We thought we would hear birds singing and instead the tram has caned music. Not what we went to hear. For oldies it would be nice if the tram had a few more stops.The bird shows are a must and do walk through the aviary where the birds are flying all around you.The restaurant was a lovely place to take a break. There are a few places where you can get refreshments. Well worth the effort.
The park is located slightly outside the city and I found it convenient taking a cab which charged us 18SGD from Farrer park. I was simply amazed to see all the different variety of birds at this park. Ideal place for kids and bird enthusiasts to make them familiar with the different species of birds. The park is huge so I suggest you could take the extra tram pass to make your trip comfortable. Do not miss the high flyer show which showcases the the talents of the parrots and macaus. The park has a few food outlets and sufficient toilets and water filling stations so as to make your trip comfortable. Good to spend a couple of hours bird watching in this magnificent place.
"Went mid week with myself and 7 year old son. We enjoyed the park. The shows were especially well done. The presenters were articulate and able to keep the interest of the diverse crowd. They also spoke clearly, slowly and did not use Singlish. The diverse crowd came from many nations with English being the second or third language for many so keeping it simple was important.Tip: Do research on line for the times of the shows so you can plan your day accordingly. Otherwise you might end up in the wrong place when you want to go to a show."
"The bird park is an excellent location with a variety of exhibits. The shows are also fantastic, so make sure you're aware in advance of the timings so you can align your visit with the shows. The only caveat is if there is heavy sustained rain then you will simply have to accept there's almost nothing to do and either have a coffee and hope it stops, or take a large umbrella and prepare to get wet or accept defeat and go home. What seems like indoor attractions (the waterfall and the lory feeding area) are actually netted roofing and offer no protection from the elements - so make sure you look at the weather forecast first :)"
"The park is about 40 mins drive from Orchard road but it is fantastic for kids. They have a huge variety of birds some of them you can even feed and they are kept in their natural habitat kinda setting. There are various shows as well during the day, we watched the high flyer and the kings of the skies and liked both. There is a nice small water park also inside the park for the kids to cool down after loads of walking."
"One of the best outside the UK.a rich and varied collection of birds not seen usually in other bird parks.Inteeractive and funny shows, see some of the amazing birds closer to you and nature. A must visit whilst in Singapore...There is a pizza Hut in the park!Usually takes atleast couple of hours to see the park, take the tram if you are tired or its hot. Don't miss the vultures"
"Jurong Bird Park takes about 45-50 minutes to reach from downtown Singapore on the East -West MRT line and then a local bus. The 30 minutes bird show at 11 am or 3 pm with toucans, parrots and other birds which perform sometimes very advanced tricks should not be missed. Otherwise take your time to stroll around the park with its numerous large aviaries. The park helps protect endangered species and birds in many parts of the world, and its research and breeding facility can also be visited - very interesting."
We really enjoyed our day at the bird park. Can't wait for the new bird park to be built near all the other zoo's. It will be fantastic to have them all in the one area. We caught the MRT and then local bus to the bird park with no dramas.
"Jurong Bird Park has many species of birds, like the Philippines Eagle that can catch and eat monkeys, on display.Tram ride has 4 stops with unlimited hop-on and hop-off. Suitable for wheelchair users as the tram drivers will assist with portable metal steps to help the wheelchair user up and down the tram. Special wheelchair seats for the wheelchair user and carer. This made life easier for my elderly mother.While Jurong Bird Park is very hilly, there is ample wheelchair access. Carers get a good workout while enjoying the Bird Paradise.Loved the Lory Loft and Hornbills / Toucan exhibit. Got to see the Hornbill feeding its mate.Also saw domesticated crown pigeons following us.Lots of good photo opportunities.Good playground and slides for the kids as well.Interactive bird shows were a hit too."
"There was a great selection of birds to see, particularly the macaws. I was a little disappointed by some of the small cages. I was happy with their efforts to breed endangered species. The shows were good, though short. The parrots walk through enclosure and also the flamingos were super."
"I suggest an early start to visit the Jurong Bird Park, a part of the Park Hopper Pass and if you take the zoo out of the equation this was the best attraction of the other three. There are birds from all over the world and many of them roam free in two large aviaries. I liked not knowing what was around the next corner as the vast majority of the birds in the aviaries have no fear of humans. The highlight for me was a 30 minute bird show that left every other shows we'd seen for dead. For seniors you may find, like us, that the park is a bit hilly but there is a tram ride that takes you to central locations around the park.This place was well worth the visit."
"It is 14 years since a last visit to this attraction and there have been some improvements along the way. There is an extensive range of aviaries and open water areas for the visitor to enjoy. Those who prefer can be transported around the site by a train (at extra cost). But it is quite manageable to walk. Some of the large walk through enclosures do offer very close encounters with an extensive range of species. There are a number of eating opportunitÃ©s although the buffet restaurant opens at 11.30am and was close closing at 13.00 when we walked in.The bird shows are a little like circus but the raptor show was more educational and less of a performance. Access is easy by public transport or taxi. We managed a special deal for entry as they had a promotion day.Several aviaries were closed to visitors for maintenance purposes and this was not, perhaps, obvious until we got to them.The Bird Park is moving soon to the Singapore Zoo site so it will be a whole new experience next time"
"Friendly to family with strollers. If you love birds, a place to go with family especially when you have children. The place is educational for the children. There are penguins, emu, stork, vultures, macaws and many more.If you don wan to walk too much, you can also opt for tram ride. There are different shows too, do refer to the brochure, they are worth stopping over to watch and hear the explanation by the park staff.With stopping to take pictures and rest stop for the legs, it takes about 2-3 hour slow leisure to complete the visit.Do have a good pair of walking shoes and bring water bottle with you to stay hydrated. There is no shelter in most of the exhibits so if you come during a rainy season, you may want to bring an umbrella"
"Situated far from the city and the travel options are less (either you have depend on bus or taxi) Bird park is a good attraction if you are visiting such a park for the first time. If you have visited any bird park earlier in any other place, then I would recommend not to waste time on this place as it is the same as in any other country. Birds are limited and the shows are okay. Tram stations are situated such that you have to walk in between two tram stations back and forth to visit all the attractions."
"Was a lovely walk through the park engulfed with colourful birds. Managed to catch two amazing shows and the aviary was a wonderful space with refreshment and restroom facilities. There was a man-made waterfall in a jungle like scene with lots of birds, butterflies, squirrels, racoons, however, was a bit disappointed as didnt get to see much of the larger birds, must have been hiding in the canopy....We got caught in an amazing rainstorm in the midst of our exploration and took cover at a way side stop and had to hurriedly wind up as all the birds were taking cover.... but it was great fun, trying to peak at the rest of the birds in the pouring rain and ensuring we had covered maximum exhibits. So an advise is, carry umbrellas and raincoats/towels, covers for equipments with you as weather can change in an instant and the downpour can be quite heavy and strong in SIN."
Wasn't exactly thrilled with the experience. I feel that one cannot go around the park too happily given the steep slopes. Kids however may love seeing colourful birds. Would take you around 2 hours to have a tour around the park
"A great experience - plenty to see. There are about 500 species and 4000+ birds at this park. The grounds are lovely however the park is relocating closer to the zoo next year.The bird shows are worth seeing - the trained parrots, toucans etc are awesome.Also a hop on hop off tram which makes it so easy to get around. Worth doing."
"To our opinion the garden is interesting for birdlovers and specially the 2 huge cages that are covered with nets are worthwhile to visit. Here a wide range of birds fly semi free through the ""jungle"" and around a artificial waterfall. Interesting for the birdlovers and photographers. The birds are wonderfull. Most of the staff is very friendly and helpful, some of them are very arrogant and walk through the line of photographers, not willing to give them 15 seconds of time!"
"A beautiful and must place to visit. You will find a huge variety of birds spread in a vast area. You get a tram to ride along the entire stretch of the park. There are also bird shows that happen in amphitheater which is fun to watch. Make sure to attend, it's one of a kind. It also has a beautiful waterfall. Must visit."
"We are not big fans of zoos etc. but we thought we should have a look. The animals seem okay but i'm not Dr. Doolittle. If they are doing what they say they are doing, protecting habitats and saving birds like the Philippines Eagle they are doing a good job then. They charge you for everything they can but they have to earn money. The highlights were the 11:45 a.m. Hornbill chit chat, the wildlife officer was excellent and informative and the Wings of Asia aviary where they all pretended they were dead on the path, the lowlight was the nagging feeling the birds would rather be anywhere else."
"Must rate this as the best part of my Singapore visit.The animals species are plenty to see and you get a feel of their habitats being maintained.Must watch - the shows in the zoo specially the bird shows are amazing. So make sure you don't miss itThe zoo is very well maintained and huge.. I was running through things .. still took a good 2 hours.. Families can spend half a day easily.You will watch birds on the grounds next to you and butterfly floating around you.You will see animals that you only read about and saw in pictures till now.Most importantly, a lot of endangered species that may not be available anywhere else.Best attractions: Penguins.. extinct birds exhibit and hunter birds.Highly recommended!"
Went for 2 performances that shows what birds are capable of. The park itself it mot very big and you should complete the visit on half a day.
"We visited this place primarily for our child, as an education; however it sends us mixed emotions while we r there! Travel by taxi as far away located; buy 4 in 1 park hopper pass for max discounts"
"Plan a visit in the first half of the day. We went around 3 pm. It was raining too. So could not interact with the birds. Only during the feeding time we can do that I suppose. There's a hop on /off toy tram stopping at specific points of attraction inside the Jurong park for those who can't walk much. There are clear indications, directions to walk around. So enjoyed the natural environment and sighted the birds despite being caught in the rain."
Our kids loved this place. The bird shows were great. Lots of photo opportunities. Kids loved feeding the penguins! The train between the different stations was a great way to get your bearings. The prices in the souvenir shop were reasonable (although avoid the kids watches as the hands don't move correctly and go slow). Even a downpour didn't ruin our day. It was well worth travelling across town to visit!
"Good place for kids, very educative and gives a lot of information about the nature and it's conservation."
We enjoyed the afternoon walking through all parts of the park. Got plenty and photos and a few souvenirs. Well worth the visit.
"One of the first parks to open in Singapore in the middle of an industrial estate is not just a wildlife park but also stands as a testimony to the air quality of Singapore.A very good collection of some of the rarest birds and should be commended for the various conservation work done especially breeding some the not so easy birds.Having said this, the management should really look into educating visitors as to how they should behave around wildlife. In some of the aviaries, I have seen children chasing the birds, people feeding human food to the birds or harassing the birds for photographs or even using flash to take photographs of the birds.The bird shows are fantastic and so are the chit chat sessions."
"Good and maintained bird park having large number of birds from penguins to parrots to swains.Tram service available to make it less hectic,away from MRT but few public buses go there,have atleast 4 hr.Avoid holidays,better to buy tickets online to save time ,combo ticket with other parks are good deal."
Book online get some deals. Get there 9.30 am see the first show at 10 am near entrance then the next few shows are timed after that.Buy the unlimited tram ride then hop on off as the park is quite extensive especially if it's hot.I wouldn't stay for lunch as I've had enough if birds after 4-5 hours close by is the science museum or IMM factory outlet store.I'd recommend it as a pretty good tourist attraction. Well kept clean and the staff are helpful. Most of the shows were pretty entertaining
"Must see for bird lovers! They have a wide variety of birds. Try to catch the info sessions (we were able to catch the hornbill one) and the shows, especially the King of the Skies. If you are early in the park, you can try feeding the lories for 2 SGD per cup of feed. However, if you arrive near lunchtime, I wouldn't recommend it as the lories might be full already from previous feedings so your cup of feed might be wasted. Also, there are two majestic Philippine Eagles in the park that everybody should see.It is, admittedly, a bit of walk though, with some parts uphill. Also, some of the birds are so far in the cages that they are a bit hard to see."
"I would have given the place five stars if not for the lack of swans. I only saw two when I was expecting more from the swan lake. Anyway, the penguins were really cute and I loved seeing them for the first time! It's an item off my bucket list. The flamingos and pelicans were a sight to behold as well! Loved the Klook package I got.It can be very warm in the park, so take advantage of the free tram rides. Don't miss the parrot show and the talk about hornbills.To get here, just ride the MRT to Boon Lay and ride Bus 194 from Boon Lay Bus Int. To go back, just wait for Bus 194 in the exact same bus stop where you alighted.There are restaurants inside the park and a few vending machines at the tram terminals."
Hasn't been there for a while and I must say the roads are accessible everywhere for a pram. Visited during their admission period in celebration of their 10 years anniversary. Many sightseeing points were fenced up and require fees before entry so the admission to these places add up to almost the cost of an admission ticket. All in all nice weather and air that day of my visit! Good workout!
"Unfortunately as a tourist I unknowingly went on a day that free admission was offered to all Singapore citizens and residents so the place was packed. It was more like a zoo than a bird park! The line to get in was out the door and I paid full price admission and the cost of a taxi to get there so I just stuck it out.The place itself is great for viewing birds from all over the world, especially those that are endangered or near extinct, so that was nice to see the rarities, however, as an avid birder, it always pains me to see birds caged up that should be flying free. I find it very sad for the birds but it is a double edged sword, since some of these birds would be poached or sold for trade in the wild, and at least here they have some type of life, albeit, not a truly natural one.As far as the park goes, it is huge, and if you choose to walk the entire place like. I did, wear comfortable clothes and be prepared to sweat. There is a tram that you can take for an additional fee.As a health foodie I did not find there were many healthy food choices but if you are not picky there is plenty to eat, as long as you are willing to wait in line and overpay.To be fair, this was not the best day to go, perhaps during the week on a normal day it would be ok. There were a lot of moms with baby strollers, screaming kids yelling and running around, scaring the birds so it was not a relaxing day by any means, it was quite disappointing, but again, for families with somewhat disciplined kids I think it would be better for the birds. There are bird shows which were interesting, again I feel bad for the birds, but some of the intelligent parrots and exotic birds that would normally be caged up all day at least get to perform ""tricks"" which may stimulate them and get them out of the cage and flying around. I looked overhead and did not see any netting so I often wonder why they don't just fly away but they are so well trained they seem to feel this is home so who knows if it is better for them in the long run?Upon leaving, the taxi stand line took 40 minutes to get through, so do download an app like Grab or something else (I was told after the fact.)"
Have taken several groups of school students (12-13yr olds) to Jurong Bird Park over the last few years including my own in July. The Bird Park has been a highlight of the students on each of these trips to Singapore. A wide variety of birds for viewing and some very close. The Lory Loft was extremely popular with visitors walking over high wire bridges and walkways stretching amongst the trees. The students also found the Bird Park a great retreat from the hustle and bustle of Singapore. Very peaceful and relaxing.
"The aviaries are the highlight of this bird park. I really enjoyed the aviary with the waterfall and the aviary with the parrots. However, the enclosures for the birds of prey were very confining. Both of the outdoor amphitheater shows were lots of fun for the adults and kids. This park is supposed to move next year to a location close to the zoo, so I hope they can improve the conditions for the birds of prey."
There were tons of birds and I suggest you take the tram to different stops because of the view. Plus my favourite part was the bird shows.
"Having recently stumbling across a shoebill stork on a random Twitter video (not too long before we were due to arrive) and then finding out Jurong bird park had one we made it a priority to visit. So glad we got the opportunity to see this bird up close, really a highlight of the day. The rest of the park was very good, we walked the whole thing but you can jump on the free tram to get around quicker however it appeared you would miss alot or would have to back track which defeats taking the tram! Lots of different birds to see, I'm not big on watching nature shows but found alot of these birds very rare/unusual that I hadn't seen before (but that could/probably due to my ignorance). Quite away out from the bay area where we are staying and we ended up just taking a taxi, there are cheaper ways to get here but felt we didn't want to waste more of our time using public transport."
Have one of the tallest man-made waterfall aviary and birds flying free there. There are a few areas in the park where you can see birds up close and flying freely. One can take the MRT to Boon Lay and switch to a bus to bring you to the park. Must visit before its relocation to the Singapore Zoo at Mandai.
"A place for all the bird lovers !Beautiful, huge variety of birds including vultures and penguins. Children can also go including the ones on pram. All age groups. But it gets too hot and it demands walking. Although there is tram which has 4 stops and there were kind of vehicles which you could hire ( but not sure about that )There are eating options as well . There is an indian restaurant also. Pizza hut was also seen.Best part was the Amphitheater show."
"See the shows , appreciate the beautiful flamingos, the colorful parrots, the explanations on the roles of the vultures in nature .. I am impressed by how clean is the place, the water fountains nicely displayed everywhere. And easily accessible by taxi, bus"
It's really good place to visit in half day.. 1st half is better... try to reach early there.. before 9 am.. so you can move around in tram for 1 hour before bird show.. 1st show is 10 am & 2nd show is 11 am.. 2nd show is more interesting... in tram they will take you 3 different station.. all are good to visit.. you can go by walk also but tram is really good experience..
"From Singapore Chinatown, easily accessible by MRT & short bus connection . Allow 3-4 hours visit to include main bird show & feeding time, longer time if have small children /elderies with need to stop for food.Tram ride stops at major designations so best to walk to cover in between areas of attractions. We arrived just after the rain so did not see as many birds as anticipated in the park and waterfall area. Bird show was excellent. Eateries available in different locations."
"Very well laid out, some birds we couldn't see as may be hidden among the greenery. Takes a couple hours for having a good look. The Aviary and waterfall were good. Price $5 more for tourists. Wasn't too happy about that. But overall a good day out.Use the Green line for the MRT, then the 194 bus. cheaper this way about 5-8 SGD total return depending where you come from although it takes about 1.5 hours each way again depending where from. Taxi quicker but about $20 SGD each way"
"We visited the Bird Park, something we haven't done previously, as we had already been to the excellent Bird Park in KL. While it is well laid out, with bird shows and feeding times, especially great if you have children. The birds in the cages were difficult to see on occasion, as they were hiding amongst the trees. It's well worth a visit, lots of food and drink around for tourists. You can do tours, but we caught the MRT from Orchard (we caught the Red line train, you then make sure you get on the Green line (it is a long way out, but it gives you a birds eye view of all the satellite cities a long the way and a short bus ride to the Park (on bus 94)from the train station. An excellent way to travel there."
"It's been my fifth or sixth time visiting this park. It's just that I really love to come back visiting Jurong Bird Park again and again! I really love the Lorikeet feeding session as you just have to buy $2-3 per cup and start to find the Lorikeet bird to feed it directly from nearby branch. What a good experience for my girl, to be able to encounter directly with such a gentle, loving, and cute wild animal."
Enjoyed the trip with my family. The kids loved feeding the birds in the aviary and the bird shows. Try to visit during the weekdays to avoid big crowds
"The Bird park is a very interesting place, as it gathers the birds from all parts of the world and the setting is very beautiful. It is just enjoyable to spend a day here, wandering around, looking at birds , listening to their songs.Especially interesting for the little ones."
"We really had a nice morning at this place. While the facilities are getting older, the birds are amazing. We heard that they will be moving to a new location next year and I would go back to see how the birds are housed in a new location.The train was a life saver, we like to walk and hike but with the heat, it was wonderful to hop on and off. We ended up going around a few times just to catch the breeze!"
"Nice bird park, the aviaries are kept clean and are spacious. There were hand sanitizers at each entrance of walk through aviaries but most of them were empty which is frustrating. The birds will come and land on you in some walk throughs, especially the Lori's.Great attraction for kids!"
The location is quite far from the city centre. It is a nice bird bark with good shows especially the High Flier show. The tram ride is very crowded with people and the queue takes about 15 minutes. Be sure to also visit the Lory Loft to feed the birds.
"We were total 3 adults and 2 kids. Tickets cost us around 125 Singapore dollars. We reached there around 11 am. A nice place to visit especially with children and better if you like birds. Large array of birds are kept including penguins. It's good if you walk around and cover the place on foot. Many varieties of hornbills which you won't find anywhere else. A small tram which costs 5 dollars extra, but must try. It covers the whole park. Few food joints are available near the entrance as well as outside. But the show stopper was bird feeding area. We enjoyed this activity the most especially my daughter. Nectars are available at 2 dollars which you can buy and feed the birds. They will come and sit on your hands and eat the nectar. Bird lovers will definitely love it. There are some other live shows also take place which you can attend. Overall an interesting place to visit. Keep 3 to 4 hours to complete it."
"Beautiful park, worth a visit if you're interested in rainforests or attractive birds. The park is not as spread out as the Zoo, so no real need to take the tram. It's great that normal people have the opportunity to see rare species of birds, so dingbats who object to animals in captivity should not bother to visit and leave useless reviews. hope that when they move near the Zoo, they can reproduce the amazing vegetation here."
Went there with my wife and had a great time getting to know all the types of bird. Will be back for sure
"This was my second visit to the park and was totally worth it. For some one who loves birds and nature - will have an awesome time.Don't miss the shows that happen at particular times around the park.Also carry swimwear and get wet at ""Birdz of Play"""
"Jurong Bird Park is a must see place if youa re visiting Singapore. It has an excellent variety of birds, which one doesn't get to see in urban environment. The Parrot Paradise section is the best. It has at least 15-20 different variety of parrots/ macau birds.The entire park can be covered in 4-5 hours easily on foot. For senior citizens there is a tram, which takes the tourist around the park and stops at different sections. Tram ticket is extra.First thing you should after entering the park is find out the show timings. There are 2 main bird shows - Pool Amphitheater Bird Show and High Flyers show (currently being shown). Both these shows are excellent and if you are travelling with small children, they will simply love it.Once you note the timings, you can plan your movement inside the park accordingly and cover all the sections by keeping the show timings and location map in mind.In certain sections, the birds are much free inside the large area and you can actually touch them, feed them etc. while larger birds such as different macaus, hornbills are in large cage like areas. There are few live demonstrations also conducted with some real birds, which are handled by the trained park staff.Overall a truly enjoyable bird park visit, worth the money."
"Recently visited with my two kids 7&5. Bought as part of 4 park pass. It's a little far from the city but we had a great day. Loved that you could see the animals from the tram. We were advised to do a full lap in the tram by a friend and that's what we did. We then went back to the animals we wanted to see more closely. The park has a nice kids water play area - recommend that they have a supervisor at all times as some parents were not watching their kids. The shows were the highlight of our visit. They were fantastic and the people who ran them were great. Very clear speakers, easy to understand and very entertaining."
Good time! A lot of exotic birds to see along with live shows & all. Definitely better than the River Safari & Night Safari! This park would also take nearly a day to complete! Great for kids!
We really enjoyed the bird park. There is lots to see with lots of shows as well. The infrastructure is looking a little out dated as it awaits a move to the zoo.
It was a pleasant sight to watch the birds like penguins and flamingos that I don't get to see often. One hard striking thing was that some species (like some parrots) were kept in cages and it was disheartening to see that.
Shuttle Bus Services could be improved and timed as per the shows scheduled in the park. A live commentary could also be arranged for imparting information about the birds.
took bus from Boon Lay early morning. Well laid out with walk-through aviaries where you can get close to the birds. Really enjoyed the 'Lory Loft' & Waterfall Aviary. Nicely maintained enclosures & informative signage. Unfortunately ran out of time to see any of the shows but would recommend a visit to any families or if you had 3-4hrs to spend.
"The shows are great, means we were surprised how they have taught this lil birds what a finishing performance. The Lorry loft area is just superb such an exciting nd thrilling experience. Kids will love even adults too."
Once should visit in pleasant season.. would not recommend in summer specially with 1 -2 years old baby. Otherwise it's great children may enjoy the bird show there
do not have that much to stay it was a pleasant experience not many queues friendly staff lots of cute birds .I would realllllllllly recommend getting the nectar it costs a dollar or two but when the bird sits o your hand the experience is worth it.the shows here too are pretty good.
"Compared to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari, Jurong Bird Park is a much more peaceful trip, where more time can be spent watching the birds and getting up close. However, some parts of the park seem to require maintenance or upgrading, such as the penguin enclosure. The temperature seemed too warm for the enclosure and the enclosure itself, including the glass, seem dirty and not well looked after. I still don't see why such majestic penguins like the Emperor penguin should even be here in Singapore!Overall, the other bird enclosures were decent. However, I don't think I will patronise it again. I'd rather the birds of prey and other large birds be released into the wilderness."
Overall was good. Entrance fee still alittle too expensive . Even for locals.should make it more affordable for everyone.
It was a fun and relaxing sun afternoon at Jurong Bird Park. Enjoy the stroll around the park and the High Flyers show.
This Singapore wildlife bird Park is located in Jurong region. Place is well maintained with variety of world birds to watch in their almost natural habitat.
Saw so many kinds of birds especially parrots. Took pictures with them. Waterfall aviary and birds/peacocks freely flying. We had to quietly go near them for a pic. Some would coolly pose for a pic and some would turn their face around and some flew away! The bird show was outstanding where they sang Happy birthday to you... said numbers 1 to 10 and also sang couple of chinese songs. Us and our parents enjoyed this place.
"This is our second visit and if we visit again in 3 years time, we were told by our Grab driver, that the Singapore government intends to consolidate the attractions - Jurong Bird Park, the Singapore Zoo and the Night Safari into just one location - to give visitors more time to take in the park instead of wasting time traveling from one location to another.And the birds - from the prey to those at play - are always a pleasure to see and hear. Surely Jurong is not just for the birds."
Amazing Bird Park with a good variety of species from different parts of the world. Lories were a favourite. Friendly and used to visitors so they are happy to sit on your hand for a photo opportunity. About sng $14 via taxi from the city. Note this park is soon moving to a new larger complex next to Singapore Zoo.
Very helpful and eager to guide. Surely will come again.Did a wrongful transaction and they gave me a refund. They did it cheerfully. Well done guys.
"This is the second time we have visited this park, once 12 years ago without kids, and recently with 2 children. While the park hasn't changed much in 12 years it is still a great, affordable day out."
Bring your walking shoes and make sure you have lots of water because there is so much to see! Don't miss the waterfall aviary!
"This is huge bird park with some trained birds those were showed in show sessions, Penguins are there too. 34 S$ entry fee."
The tram Q was super long and it's very humid. It will be good to install more fans.But we do love the tram ride and they really ensure safety!We were able to eat our lunch and watch the Parrot show!
I was mesmerized to see so many different species of birds. They not only take care of these birds but even hatch new species.The penguins were a delight to watch. Do not miss the parrot bird shows. They are a must.
"Obviously nearing its closure, this is still a worthwhile trip for bird lovers. We watched and enjoyed the High Flyers show, especially the parrot singing in three languages! The monorail is long gone ,and I would agree with other reviewers who say the tram stops are in odd locations, not very convenient to main attractions. We loved the flamingos, hornbills and the Lory Loft, but not very much to see in the Waterfall Aviary. Dining options very limited compared to other WRS parks - ended up having a tough, stall, tasteless hotdog heated up in a microwave at the Waterfall Aviary for lunch."
"An enthralling experience from witnessing the power of birds of prey to the gimmicks and uncanny intelligence of macaws and hornbills, the bird park is a satisfying journey for the young and old alike."
"Buy the tram ticket at the gate unless you are able bodied and enjoy hills.Get in on opening up to the Lory enclosure to feed nectar in the monster aviary and plan on spending a lot of time in the waterfall aviary spotting the birds.Great half day out which could easily be a full one for bird enthusiasts.If you require sustenance avoid the curry gardenn -it's not very clean, lacklustre service and watered down flavours"
"My friends wanted to come here, I was not very keen to go along at first but it turned out a lot better than I thought. It was really fun to see all the different types of birds but it is quite expensive to go there."
A very nice Bird park with an impressive amount of birds in all sorts. We were magnified by all the different toucans and their impressive facilities. We could easily spend more hours in this park even though we were there for 5 hours with 3 kids under 6 years of age. The only really bad comment we have concerns the conditions of the water play area. This was really not worth a visit.
"WE travelled by train and bus to Jurong Bird Park on a Friday which was great as it was not crowded. We caught the train to Boon Lay and then Bus 194 from the bus terminus in the adjacent shopping mall, Bus 194 takes you directly to the Bird Park and you catch the same Bus (194) back from the same spot where you alighted. Allow several hours to wander around the park to witness all the birds in a simulated natural habitat. We were lucky to arrive just on feeding time (9:30am approximately) for the penguins, there is also Eagle demonstrations and other bird feeding. It is very easy to get photos with Birds. The disappointment is the food available, basic at best. If you enjoy seeing a vast array of Birds then you should enjoy the experience"
Very colourful range of birds. They will come to you and photos easy as they are super friendly use to crowds
A relaxing park for 2-3 hrs walking and sweat out. The surrounding with lots of green and clean. The show are interactive. Bring along swimming suit for kids as the wet & dry playground is a good place for them to beat the heat.
"This was my fourth visit to Singapore but some how i had never found time to visit this park thinking it was something for children.This visit was really an eye opener. This park is a great attraction. You not only see so many exotic birds like penguins, flamingos, vultures, colourful macaus etcbut you learn so much about them. The short shows like penguin feeding, vulture shows etc are very informative.The high flyers show is the best for both children and adults.The ride on the toy train is also a great entertainment and a good way to have a general view of the park and the inmates."
"JBP is a place that will always be special to me. It houses a fantastic collection of birds, and makes a good effort to allow visitors to interact closely and learn more about the birds. I hope that the new venue will further improve the place."
"Despite being out of the way, this is still one of the best place for bird watching. Lovely environment created for birds."
This place is easy to access on the MRT and then a bus from the interchange. There are lovely gardens at the entrance in true Singapore style. We were entertained with the bird show. The walk-in aviary was a delightful experience and a lot of the birds were quite close and easy to see. Watch out for the weaver birds flying in and out of their hanging nests. We enjoyed this place.
"Years ago, we visited the Park for the first time and were deeply impressed. This time, we were surprised how much trees and bushes had grown ad how the park was reshuffled. It is nice to make the train trip once around the area - but there is not much to see as far as birds are concerned. We must admit that we did not attend any performance - we just visited the different sections of the park.It is nice that the bus stops in front of the Park upon arrival - but return to town is a little tricky although logical (one-way roads). We saw beautiful birds although the green is dominating. The Park is. recommendable for people without foot problems - the little train is of some help but not too much. Younger children might become very tired."
Its a standard bird park not too big but the kids love it for the birds shows and other attractions where you can touch the birds and get urself clicked with them
Good place for bird lovers.Place is not that big but good enough for 3-4 hours .Dont miss their shows which happens at 10 and 11 in morning.Worth watching shows.
"24 Feb, 2019 we went to the Jurong Bird Zoo., Singapore. The first thing we found out that the discounted seniors price advertised only applies to Singapore residents all other countries pay full price.We paid the extra five dollars for the tram ride. At station one we were told to take a seat because we are disabled. We waited for ages and still told to take a seat. After waiting for a long time we got up and walked off. They ignored us.The bird show happens twice a day and we watched that. A show not to be missed. Very well done.The park is well set out and if you can get the tram to high spots and walk back down looking at all the enclosures. There are shops and food outlets around the park and plenty of rest rooms/toilets around the park.They also have water bottle refill stations at the tram stops.There are a vast number of birds on display and in the middle a fantastic water park for the children. Bring their costumes and towels.The walk in enclosures gets you up and close to the birds.It takes about 4 hours to see it all and well worth it.Bus tours turn up in the morning but they are gone by lunch time.In 2020 the park allegedly moves to the Singapore Zoo we were told.A special thanks to Annie in the shop at the Kids Water Park and Sun Win who works with her. Annie was great in serving up and is a credit to the Bird Park. Well done.Overall it is a great half a day experience that is not to be missed."
"Travelled in Jan2019.Pros - Very systematic layout, Map was given to us during entry.All road signs ,directions on road inside were clear.We have attended two bird shows .They were good!.The tram to was really useful to travel inside.Facilities like washrooms ,drinking water were available at all sites.Penguins were also one of the main attractions.If you are bird lover then you should spent at least 4-5 hoursCons - This attraction was since so many years ,we observe marks of deterioration in cages, structures."
The Jurong Bird Park is on a hillside in the northwestern part of Singapore. Really liked the aviaries where you could walk inside and the birds were free to fly around. The areas with cages were far less nice. This park is moving locations in 2020 and hopefully they will have more aviaries and less cages there.
"This is a stunning park, some of the birds are almost so close that you can touch them. Some of the cages are definitely in need for a reforming and too small for some birds! But overall this was a wonderful park and i enjoy it from the beginning till the end of my visit!"
overall experience is good. all the show is very nice. nice photo spot. etc. varieties of paratos. good
My daughter enjoys the two bird shows. Also feeding the flamingoes. It could be better if there is more food outlets. Currently there is only small pizza outlet near the main entrance. It will be quite far for the visitors who walks around the park. But the park really makes the visitors enjoy the natire and the free roaming birds exhinits
"Not sure if it's because they are moving soon but it is clear that the bird park, while still a great concept, no longer receives the degree of care it once had. Many cages are empty. The facilities are not always clean. The shows do not have the same quality (or attendance). Unfortunately, this park is aging. I hope the move will help give it a boost."
"Visited here on our first day in Singapore ' hotel staff suggested a taxi as it would be quite a trek by train and bus otherwise. Glad we did as it really wasn't expensive by taxi and an awful lot cooler!The park is amazing ' hundreds of varieties of birds from all over the world, many of which are critically endangered or on the verge of extinction in their natural habitats. Be warned it is huge, with some 'must sees' too ' ours were the waterfall aviary, wings of Asia and parrot paradise, but we are slightly biased as we are hyacinth macaw fans!The High Flyers show was great although we were very concerned as to the number of group tours there, but they seemed to 'disappear' after the show so guess they were on a 'whirlwind tour' of Singapore which included a couple of hours here.We took our time ' we are animal and bird enthusiasts ' we sat regularly and also drank plenty as it got hotter as the day went on. Including eating lunch (but not visiting the kids play park) we spent five hours here!Would we return ' you bet!Oh and the staff were great too ' helpful, polite and informative!"
"A well maintained park with wide variety of birds, saw two shows, both were good , saw penguin feeding session too , that was ok ( bit lengthy) tram ride is nice and exciting, overall a good day to spend whole day, kids will enjoy it"
"Decided that it's been waaaay too Long since I have last gone to the Jurong Bird Park.Brought the twins there for a day out and I must say, although it seemed a bit smaller than I remembered, it still was a nice day out.The show was still fun.The residents there were still beautiful.Lots to see.And there is even a water park (free!)Pity it was a bit too hot for the babies.Nevertheless, still quite fun and the twins had a great time!"
"We went to see the morning show first, which was very good, but the queues for the tram afterwards was very long so maybe not a good idea. We really enjoyed the waterfall aviary and the Lorie aviary where you can get close to the birds. Pelicans, parrots, penguins, flamingos, owls, eagles, so many different breeds of birds it really is worth a visit."
We visited the bird park with our 3 year old daughter.We were there on the Christmas.We reached the park early just around the opening hours and it was the best thing to do.We were the early few to enter and so there was no rush..we could get a place easily in the trams and the shows( yes it's a long walk for the 3 yrs old )...v managed to see all the shows and the shows are fantastic.There is water park and a play area for the kids which was a added bonus...my daughter totally enjoyed...the variety of birds is also great! In short it's a great place to visit with younger kids.
"If you love birds or have kids who do, this is a must-see. The colourful parrots display welcome you then the graceful flamingoes in the lake.There's a tram with 3 stops to bring you around.The Lorie aviary with hand feeding was spectacular with very hungry eager lories landing on your arm and even head.The vulture and big bird section is impressive.We went during the festive period and got a one year unlimited ticket for the price of a one day ticket. Such a lovely surprise and great value! We are already planning our next visit."
"Good park to visit with your family, count around 3-4 hours for the whole park. very hot and himid, you are outdoors the whole time, so no AC at all. in some places of the park, the smell of birds is very strong. The perrots section is the best, very colorful!"
This is a great half day of experience to enjoy the myriad of wild birds and colour enjoyed with this special place. Great value
"When we visited the zoo night safari we learnt that the bird park is to be shifted to the same site as the zoo. This could explain the fact that we felt there was information lacking at the bird park. That said the bird park is still wort the time. getting there is no more difficult that the zoo though the bus connection at the train stop is not quite so obvious. The entry way with its arch of orchids is truly impressive. The lay out is not quite as efficient as the night safari at the zoo and we found we did some doubling back at times. We saw some spectacular birds and the bird show we saw was quite excellent. What disappointed us was that, at times, there was no information about the origin of these birds. Generally the huge walk in aviaries had notice boards that helped identify the birds within and we found ourselves trotting back and forth to do just that. But, at times we had no idea which countries were the natural habitat of these great.creatures. In one aviary we met an attendant willing to talk and we had a very informative conversation about the birds close by. We are anticipating that, when this bird park is to be relocated and when it is, the new venue will address the issue we encountered."
"We always visit the Jurong Bird Park at least 4-5 times a year as our Son, Denver is a bird fanatic. This year we are very happy that they have a Bird Eye Tour where we get to see special behind the scenes. Upon our arrival, it was raining and Grace , our tour guide was very nice to reschedule us a new date but the weather suddenly clears up and the dark skies went away and we are so happy that Grace said we could still carry on with the tour. Grace is very welcoming and heart warming and Denver got really comfortable with her quickly and they both chatted away taking about the different kinds of birds and Grace was so patient with Denver's queries, answering each of them with love. It was a memorable experience and we got to get up close with some of Denver's favourite birds like the Hornbill, Hawk, Vulture and Owl. We even got to see a baby owl that was one month old at the time of our visit and it was so cute and fluffy. We loved and enjoyed the interactions and feeding sessions with Sally the Hornbill and the Hawks. Birds are actually very intelligent and very interactive and it's actually really fun and exciting for young children. Even my one and a half year old Daughter enjoyed her bird Eye Tour experience. Highly recommended and If you happen to have Grace as your tour guide, it's your lucky day cos she's such a sweetheart and she's really good with children."
photos with such big parrots was amazing. but cost of photos is very high when convert to rupees. but i purchased 3 for S$50.
"Very nice bird park, lot of birds.. Macaws, hornbill, flamingos... Have small water park inside as well. Have bird shows. Don't miss, specially if you have kids."
"Jurong Bird Park is mostly made up of large glasshouse-like habitats. In some, you can walk through the habitats and see the birds in the various enclosures. Some have a large number of the birds roaming free within the glasshouse so they can fly past you or walk past you on the path as you are looking around and exploring. It's great to be able to see most of the birds up close with the open enclosures for some.At the Lory feeding area, there is a large suspension bridge that is great for walking and taking pictures.There are also bird shows conducted at various areas in the park.Food choices are very simple as compared to other wildlife attractions in Singapore.The large playground and waterplay area is great for kids and looks to be a newer developed section of the park. There is a place to eat as well as a store that sells gear and accessories required for waterplay.It would be good to see how the park is revamped once they have moved to Mandai."
"Birds show, feeding time and close contact with the birds. There's children dry and wet playground where both my kids enjoyed."
Surprisingly fun. My child was introduced to a number of species of birds. The feeding of penguins was also surprisingly affordable and fun!
"My six year old son and I enjoyed this park. It's not going to knock your socks off like the Singapore Zoo, but it's cute, big enough to mean some real walking or a tram ride, and the birds seem well-cared for. The penguins are a fun thing to see."
Great visit and family do had a enjoyable times there. Love the penguins & amazed by such slim legs of the flamingo
"Good to see various birds in one place - including penguins, birds of prey, flamingos and toucans. There are interesting shows day long. The path is quite steep and it is better to opt for the tram ride to get around."
"We got the direct bus from Suntec City out to Jurong which was very convenient, however, if there's four of you I reckon it'd be cheaper to get a taxi.Jurong is a quiet day out, no hoards of people and you're able to walk around the park and enjoy the birds.It is due to relocate next to the zoo in 2 years time, so I think it'll get very busy then so take advantage of it now!"
"It was fun. There are many species of bird. However, its tiring walking as the place is big. There are not many eateries inside bird park especially for halal choices (only has pizza hut)."
The best part about Bird is their live show. One should not miss that and their timing is available in their website and ticket counter. Try to reach here by 9am so that you can cover all the shows and park w8th ease
"We visited the park to fulfil a dream of me seeing Flamingos in real life. I was not disappointed the three displays were great. The park is hilly, so be prepared for the exercise. The park could so with more food options."
Been couple times to Jurong Bird Park. I love their Flamingos :*The park is easily to reach by SMRT and really entertaining with their collection of birds and shows.
"To look around, 2 hours is not enough, 3-4 hours will be good.Check the show time, before visit.Good for families."
"Lovely natural setting and he birds appear well taken care of. Love the colourful birds.We are delighted that you had a great time with the birds, especially the rare blue macaws!"
There is a new family member in the Park: Shoebill. Another signature animal in Kemono Friends.I am visiting for Shoebill as well as penguins.
Great park - lots of large enclosures which is nice and would like to see more of thoseBus ride was good as it was hot and for $5 - why wouldn't you!
"Went here as part of a tour, weather was hot and humid and I have steel in both knees and my back. We spent about 2.5 hrs here, could easily have spent another 2 hours or so. The place has a few steepish hills that I found a little difficult but there were plenty of seats available to give the knees a rest, also there is a ""train"" system operating around the park. I would suggest a full circuit on this to get your bearings to what you want to see, timings and distances for the shows that are on offer. The waterfall enclosure was spectacular although you really have to search for the birds here. In the other enclosures most of the birds were accustomed to people so were not that skittish, therefore great photos. The big disappointment was the 1"" square heavy wire mess frontage to some of the cages - some cages had large plexiglass panels which permitted better photography. I watched the ""parrot"" show which was very good and permitted you to get up close for the good photos, unfortunately I missed the raptor show.Please note that this sanctuary is being relocated in the near future to the same area as the zoo, I was assured the new location has much better housing for the birds and better photographic opportunities."
Took my son here and we had a lovely morning out. Unfortunately the rain did mean we decided to leave but we did get around the park and experience all areas.
It is a lovely & tranquil bird park with a lot of activities and show for visitors. Clean environment and friendly stuff. Will definitely visit again.
would be great to shift birdpark to mandai. i find jurong quite far. make mandai a hub so that we have better options when buying admission packages.
"Jurong bird park is an ideal half day trip, preferably made with family or friends. It has a huge collection of birds, beautifully housed in various landscapes.Firstly, buy the tickets beforehand in order to avoid waiting in the queue.Carry an umbrella/ poncho, a bottle of water (which you can refill in the park) and a camera.If you prefer walking and spending time seeing birds, you can give up the tram ride though the tram gives you the option of spending how much ever time you wish between the pick up points.We walked from stations 1 to 3 at leisure and got to see and interact with many birds. The African waterfall is beautifully landscaped and even smells like a deep tropical forest.The parrot show is awesome and so is the lunch served with it, along with a lovely view of the flamingos. We didn't get to see the other shows though.One of the best bird parks I have been to."
I came here briefly. Its was not so expensive and I found my visit to be educational and entertaining
Went there with my 22 months old son & we had an awesome time. From shows to walks to tram ride it was all great. My son loved the areas where he could actually see and experience birds in nature (not in the cage). He ran after the peacocks and pigeons :)
I did enjoy this park and there was some lovely birds but there's just something not right about seeing them caged up! At the back of the park is a big cage that you can walk inside which was really awesome! I'd read up on a few reviews for the bird park and zoo to see how long it would take and most was saying you can do both in one day! Well you really can't and we had to cut the bird park short by about half of it to get to the zoo in time. If you want to see everything properly I'd day you could easy spend the whole day at the bird park then do the zoo on a different day. If you do want to do both in one day it is doable but you need to get there for when it opens!
"The array of birds from around the world is amazing! Most of them are in a natural environment except maybe for the penguins. I especially enjoyed the birds of paradise, penguins, giant macaws, pelicans, toucans, and the bird shows. The better places to eat are outside the entrance. You can get a stamp on your hand to reaccess the park, so it's best to plan your route ahead of time."
"The highlight to any visit to the Bird Park is the essentially ""circus"" show put on by the birds and trainers that demonstrates the intelligence level of at least some of the birds. The heart of the Park however are the features aside from the show. The wide range of species in their habitat are fascinating but because the birds are held in ample caged areas well supplied with vegetation it is at times difficult to locate the individuals that are housed in a given cage. However taking the time to spot them is rewarding. There is also a small railroad service that can be taken from major location to location that is especially handy for families with small children or the aged like myself."
"The bird park gives you access to the colourful birds of varying sizes from exotic places and those endemic in the Asian region. There are shows inside the park, which you should catch, so take note of their timings. We got to watch the ""High Flyers Show"" on the Pools Amphitheatre which is near the entrance. It showcases the colourful high flying macaws from Africa, which was awesome! Next show we got into was the Birds of Prey, which featured humongous vultures! When buying tickets, you get to purchase an add-on for the tram, which allows you breeze through different stations in the park instead of walking. Although walking would be great of your health, trekking the park might not be advisable in the sweltering heat of the Singapore tropical weather. We started late in the afternoon, so we only were able to visit about 60% of park. So it might be best to start early to be able to enjoy the whole park. I heard they're moving the park to a new location (nearer to the Singapore Zoo and to the Night Safari), so that might provide a different experience overall. We visited the park because our toddler loves birds, and living in the city-state that is Singapore, you don't really have the chance to seeing exotic birds apart from those endemic in the island country."
A great visit to see birds at the Jurong Bird Park. Most of the bird exibits are fantastic while a few are hard to see as they are in metal cages and hard to see. Mostly the vultures etc.
"Singapore is a small island, but I still felt like this was a little out of the way. It does have some lovely birds, a good playground, and plenty of opportunities to feed the wildlife. It is a nice place to spend and afternoon and seems like it would be great for kids."
"We visited JBP with our 6 yrs old Kid. He although enjoyed but we had same sad feeling of seeing birds in cage rather than they enjoying their natural habitat. Having said that,Probably we visited JBP at right time as Older Kids may get bored seeing caged birds. Yes they are doing a good job in conservation of endangered species which is really appreciated.Overall its well kept and well Maintained."
"On a recent visit to Singapore,we visited here as part of 4 Park ticked encompasses Juorng, River Safari, Night Zoo and Singapore Zoo. The site is a short MRT ride outside of central Singapore and it covers a large site. There is a vast array of avaries (including one with a massive waterfall). There is also plenty of cover in case the weather does turn.There is vast array of bird species that you only find in Asia. Well worth a visit as part of the 4 Park ticket, a good way to spend a few hours"
"We really enjoy our visit despite of the really bad weather.. We need to visit again, a shiny day this time!"
A lots of birds! Some of them is rare for me as it was my first time seeing them. It's good to bring along mosquitoes repellent especially you're wearing short pants or sleeveless top.The only downside is limited choice for food and limited restaurants.
"Not too bad a place to visit although some areas have much more concentration of mosquitoes than others.My kid loves it there, not sure why, but it could be better if they have more food & beverages amenities around the place to improve the experience.Lack (have but only 1) of the big birds (e.g. eagles, hawks, vulture etc.) made it abit disappointing.To move the owl section away from here is the worst decision for JBP imo. But knowing that you guys are looking at closing this place down ....nvm then."
"It will move by 2020 to a new location as part of the Eco-tourism Hub in Mandai, joining the Singapore Zoological Gardens, River Safari and the Night Safari with a host of other new developments.I don't remember the first time I visited but the last outing in 2015 was memorable as the trip was made with some 30 elderly persons on a company-organized outing community involvement event. This time, I had the pleasure of strolling through the park to see what I might have missed in the last visit ' afterall, that trip was a 'working trip'.The 2 bird shows remained the key highlights. The 'Kings of the Skies' at the Hawk Arena was an awesome display of birds of prey ' the hunting skills, the sharp eyes, the majestic flights. The 'High Flyers' at the Amphitheater has always been a treat with the colors of the bird on display, the interaction with the audience, the intelligence of this feathered ones. The finale of birds at the end of the show was still a sight to behold, I remembered there were more birds and colours many years back.Built on a bowl-shaped valley, Lory Loft (another highlight) offered a two-tiered feeding tower that reached right into the middle of the aviary with a 360-degree view of the area. But where were the lories and lorikeets hiding when I visited? Perhaps taking an afternoon nap after a morning of hard work? I remember the colourful experience the elderlies had in my last visit when many more of these beautiful winged creatures would feed off the hand-held cups of fascinated visitors young and old. How often you have birds perching on your arm or shoulder, feeding off your hand?The waterfall aviary was another favourite. Towering at a height equivalent to 13 storeys, it houses one of the world's tallest man-made, indoor waterfalls. The crashing sounds of water, the panoramic view of the landscape from the suspended bridge, the close encounters with Guinea fowls along the trails, the myriad of birds fluttering and perching on the trees, and the sight of the some of the more reticent birds in action. This aviary is a walk-in paradise.There were some more attractions ' the Pelican Cove, The Flamingo Lake, The Flamingo Pool, another walk-through segmented aviary where you can catch a glimpse of the birds of paradise'¦ and there is the newest attraction which is the Parrot Paradise near where the Swan Lake is. Well, I would have preferred a walk-in experience but the parrots were caged exhibits. Maybe they needed to prevent bird escapes.For the young ones, there is a playground and small water park where they can have fun while the adults take a break from the walking. Another nice cool place to hide away would be the viewing gallery within the Penguin enclosure where visitors can enjoy the tranquillity in a cool darkened environment, resting your aching legs in full sight of a colony of aquatic flightless birds from the south-pole with occasional dive-in spectacles.The Jurong Birdpark will be missed and I will be planning a couple more trips before the move to Mandai in a couple of years or so. At the same time, I am looking forward to a grand new home for The Feathered Ones."
"Around $16 each way in a taxi, There are some great walk through aviaries which are huge, one of them you can buy a small cup of bird food for $3 and as your walking round the Lori will come down & feed from you which was really nice. Some of the other enclosures were small but the park is moving (next year I think) to where the Zoo, River Safari & Night Safari are so hopefully they will build more of the huge walk in aviaries."
The show time arrangement was good as we able to watch almost all the show in time without rushing from area to area.
park is not big. bird shows are entertaining. feeding times gives the kids an opportunity to feed the birds eg penguin etc.. prepare a $2 note.. no change given.. limited numbers allowed to feed but perfectly understandable or will end up over feeding. good to have water dispensers around the park. bring your own water bottle to fill. jurong hill next to it worth a quick 5 min stop to see the view of jurong island
"A very goof display of a diverse range of bird species. Was definitely worth the visit. My only negative observation is that some of the aviaries holding the larger birds looked small and the birds within the cage looked ""bored"". But maybe i just prefer to see my wildlife a bit more free range."
"Good time pass for 2 to 3 hours. Highlight was the aviary, parrot park and the shows were good. Visit it either in the morning or in the evening as the birds will be resting or tired in the hot times. It was slightly monotonous towards the end as same birds were repeated in different cages. The trams were a well thought out idea, especially for the elders and those with small children, but to discover the park thoroughly, it is best to go about it on foot. All in all, it's an entertaining attraction for those who love nature and are curious about birds."
"It was pleasant experience to walk around the park.If you are bird lovers, you will enjoy this place much."
Generally a pleasant place to visit If can increase more species of bird will great!Tram ride is a must.. Staffs are friendly & polite.
"Very nice range of rare birds from penguins to hornbills, and activities to get close to them. Unfortunate that the tram ride is not included in the ticket (and the extra cost is not printed anywhere !) to hop in and out when tired ; fortunate that there are ventilated / A/C areas on the way to cool when too hot (cafÃ©, exhibit halls...). The nursery is very interesting. Worth the trip to visit"
Jurong Bird Park is one of its kind. Located in the Western side of Singapore it is a bit away from the central district. We took a bus from the Jurong Point Mall here as there is no direct MRT connectivity. The park is huge in size and you have different sections for each kind of birds. We really enjoyed the bird show which was spectacular especially the Hornbills and the parrots part.Do choose the Tram ride (especially on a sunny day) which gives you a quick ride around the park. You can choose to get down anywhere and hop back in. It was really a savior as the temperature was too high for a walk.
The park is small but the planning and their presentation is superb. The tram ride has to be included in your ticket. The birds are in big enclosures . They are accustomed to visitors and seem to not mind them. They just walk by the side of you at the water fall enclosure. The highlights were the macaw and birds of prey shows. They were enjoyable and the presenters put up a very good show.restaurants are available at the entrance. snacks available inside the park as well.
Brought my friends from china during early October. It was my second visit to JPB and the environment is good and eco friendly. suggestion to make it a better place would be adding more performance timing slots during weekends because when we visited we missed the only timing for the show and feel a bit disappointed.
This park has been built for a while and I seldom hear any guide tour would recommend this place. But I have a 5 years old daughter. She loves this place. You can see a lot of birds and it is a great place for kids.
"The park is well managed and organized, clean and safe. The birds are beautful and relaxed. The different signs are clear and spots are easy to reach. Quite some choices for lunch and rest. If you go to the park by public transport, bear in mind that you still need to take a bus after mrt journey. Make sure you hv enough time on transportation."
"I loved this park. Really well set out. Birds are beautiful and unique. If I was time poor, I would choose this park over the zoo."
bought ticket from website for the bird park. The bird park is out of way and does not have a direct way from MRT or Bus . So we ended up taking a taxi from Hotel to Bird Park which costs around $25. The bird park is pretty big and takes around 5 hrs to see it. There is a tram which you can ride and go to different sections and get off there and see the birds in that area. They have a lot of variety of birds and also different shows . Do not miss shows. For lunch there is a indian restaurant inside the park . Kids will enjoy it very much
"I love that this park is dedicated just to birds and it gives you a great insight into their wide diversity.There is a wide variety of exhibits - from the informative and entertaining shows, to the hands on enclosures to the static displays.My only criticism is that the design of some of the cages makes it very difficult to see the birds even if they are out in the open. But that said, it was a great day out and not so big that you cannot get around it easily."
"Lovely location, arrived in time for the show, Beautiful Hornbills and Macaws. The Pelicans and Flamingos were amazing to see. Staff are very good with the birds.Not sure if Bald Eagles should be in captivity.It is a must visit for Bird Lovers"
Curry Garden at JB Park served us fresh and delicious Indian food. Both veg and non veg options are available.
"The whole infrastructure of the park, including the facilities and how it has been set up is excellent, however the selection of birds could definitely have been more"
"Great place for young families to take the kids or just for a relaxing stroll. Be prepared for a humid day, but lots to enjoy looking at!"
Great to spend a day put with Family.Especially enjoy the performances by the bird and birds feeding.
"Visited with wife and teenagers son. So.many species of Bird can be see. Very well maintained. Don't miss the shows, they are too good. You should be prepared to walk a lot. But nice greenery and so.many birds to see. It feel energetic to be with the bird in park. Nice place to visit , when in singapore"
"The Bird Park exceeded our expectations, and the web site doesn't quite explain it in a clear fashion. We really loved the large aviaries...seeing birds in their natural environment. Taking some time to watch, wait, and see what emerged gave us a much better experience than those who just rolled around on the tram (and paid more to do so). Wild birds (eg stork-billed kingfisher) also came to the park to add to the excellent displays.The shows were OK - a little bit 'touristy' for me (but go to the Hawk Conservancy at Andover UK for really great displays where the birds perform as nature intended).We walked round the whole park, took around 5 hours, and avoided the over-priced restaurants. Had an awful coffee at $5 a cup and then it was full of sugar (beware - this is the local custom), but this didn't detract from a great day. Had some cute lizards thrown in ... great pics of a lizard in the flamingoes' drinking trough. Memorable and would do it again.Just hope they can transition to the new site in 2020 and keep the natural areas working in the same way."
My children enjoy the visit so much especially the water play but too bad the time spent at waterplay was cut short due to emergency cleaning and need to wait 1hour for the pool to be open back. Other than that was dissapointed to know that my favourite owl exhibit was close down as I was looking forward to see the owls.
"Last visited 20 years ago and still as interesting as the first time. Took the train for a trip around the park which was a lot of fun. Then went for a leisurely walk around for a closer look at the wonderful bird life. Plenty of shade as you walk with lots to see, great activity for all the family. Remember your hat and water bottle when walking to keep hydrated!"
"If you are happy to walk then there is so much to explore in the Jurong Bird Park that half a day vanishes in the blink of an eye and you are left lamenting all that you have missed out on. Even though we were there with our 3 year old son we still covered most parts of the park. The varieties of birds is immense and the resplendent colours a joy for the viewer.In half a day we could manage only one of the two shows and two feedings. the penguin feeding turned out to be a dud for us as we are vegetarians and couldn't get around to feeding fish to the penguins with our hands. The lory feeding was much more fun. For SGD 3 you get a small glass of nectar to feed the birds. The lory loft has various levels and criss cross wooden bridges which itself give you an adventure feel. The birds hardly have any nectar - in fact you will find it difficult to finish even half the glass. But they hop on to your hands, shoulders, head and that itself is so much fun. A pair of lories stuck to my head for a good 7-8 minutes before my child shooed them away forcibly.The Waterfall Aviary was the best area of the lot as you could walk around freely with the birds. My son chased quite a few of them and in general had an amazing time looking for birds hidden in bushes.The entire park is well planned out though they could have avoided some of the uphill walking. Most enclosures and the birds in them are beautiful especially the penguins and the pelicans. Would recommend at least half a day here and even more if you intend to walk around with little children."
"Well-designed learning experience with something for everyone. While the numbers of birds are small in comparison to neighbouring countries, they are well maintained. Food and beverage options are decent but rather expensive."
Sorry for late review as visited in May 2017.Do not usually visit zoos etc etc as don't agree with most of them but as this was touted as free flying with a large variety of birds thought we would visit.The park is vast with a lot of free flying aviaries where we could feed the birds which was nice to do. The whole park is very natural looking and most of the birds looked well and happy although we did find one or two cages a little smallWent to a number of the shows throughout the day which we found informative and fun.Would recommend visiting whilst in Singapore although if only there one or two days would not go out of my way.
"My children enjoyed their trip there. But my luncheon experience there was a disappointment. They should have at least a fast food restaurant (i.e. Macdonald's, Burger King or KFC or Pizza) outside the entrance and one inside the park. I only saw one Pizza Hut's takeaway outlet inside the park. Then again they are shifting to Mandai soon. Hopefully the new park will include this suggestion. Cheers!!"
This was a great place to visit for the day. A bit of a way out of Singapore central but very easy to find using the train and bus. Lots of different birds to see very informative .
"So v had taken collective tickets for all the 4 parks I.e Singapore zoo, night safari, river safari , and jurong bird park.. so v had to go there and it was like ok if u really like the birds and all then u will enjoy it otherwise u can skip this excursion .. it houses many species of different birds like blue rare Macau and variations in parrots, vultures, sparrows , it also has flamingo which are very cute .. v opted for tram ride to get breathing space and not get tired.. its best when u have so much to cover plus it saves time and energy .. one thing which struck me was the waterfall it was amazing and the sound was coming from it was like wow.. I got literally hypnotic.. I cannot sit hours and hours there listening to that beautiful wonderful melodised sound.. ohh man it was just wow .. it won my heart completely .. so without fail I visit his waterfall inside the park and get lost and n a beautiful thought .."
"Noting as got much exciting even after 10 years , shocking as anything and everything else in Singapore is ahead of time usually other Asian countriesI feel everything else is moved on Accept the bird parkNeed add more atrraction and innovation"
"An overall fuss free experience, F&B options could be more though. Lory loft was the most popular, too bad the Owls were moved to the Zoo."
"Highly Recommended for Kids and Families to Enjoy the Natural Gardens, Lakes and all Sort of Birds in one Place , really good experience to Feed the Birds, one of the best Tour for Kids to get familiar with Different type of Birds"
This place is one of the best bird sanctuaries in Asia. Surprising considering how developed Singapore is. Live shows were fantastic. The location is way out of town though. Heard they will be moving to merge with the Zoo soon.
We particularly enjoyed the hornbills and the cassowary. We had never seen such a collection of exotic birds prior to visiting Jurong.
"This park is an amazing little venue. It has birds from all around the world, great shows and a waterpark for the kids. We loved walking around at a slow pace and viewing the birds we don't see in North America. Beautiful"
"Before visiting Jurong Bird Park, I was thinking, will it be worth...! will I find something exciting in a bird park...! I mean it's just the birds what else....! with these thoughts I landed here. To my surprise, it was far beyond my expectations.... too good.. :). It took 30 Minutes for me to get there by taxi from Park Royal Hotel on Kitchener. Once in, I moved around a little bit and found that there is a High Flyers show at 11AM (it repeats at 3PM) at Pools Amphitheatre. This is one of the best (highly recommended) its a 30 Min show ends at 11.30 and you get to see almost all the exotic birds.One more recommendation, please bring cart for kids if possible. they provide electric scooters as well on rent. it will be a long walk. you can always hop on to the trams (Chargeable) but its worth it (for little heavy ppl like me :) ).In the end I would rate it to be amongst top 10 places to visit in Singapore if you are on a family trip.. Have fun and enjoy... :)"
Have a fun time with my baby there. Travel in tram provide us with ease of going around attractions. Only downside is the baby changing room is dirty and not equipped well enough for families with babies.
"Being able to get close to the bird,suggest go early because can have a look for many show. Is a good place to enjoy family day at here"
Jurong Bird Park has been one of our family faves since the kids were born. It's a great place to spend time and finish of with the fantastic playgrounds! The only minus point is that the birds may not always be visible in the cages. So that expectation has to be managed during a visit. Otherwise it's a lovely way to spend over half a day!
"The birds park was really good. Lot of birds and the tram ride was helping to drop people at different spots to visit main attraction. If you have kids ranging from 7 and above, I am sure they will enjoy it. There are many events that is there to see, like birds show in amphitheatre at 11.15 am and 3 pm, feeding the birds and specifically Young kids will love this. The park is we'll maintained and there are ample options of restaurant , food stalls. I have given 4 star as I see they have photographers inside park who will take photo of yours and sell it to you which is pricey. The options are also less to customise to your affordability. But it is a place worth visiting if you are in Singapore."
not to miss their birds show. well trained parrots.plan ur visitation in their webpage suggestions. it helps! Areas of improvement. Kids play area are dated and water is quite dirty.
"A delightful experience of the Jurong Bird Park, first time visitor although been to Singapore many times. Definitely do the tram first to get your bearing and then use it to avoid the steep climbs."
I like the shows and its nice seeing some birds roaming around freely. There were many varieties of birds around which is eye opening for me and my partner. Thank you. I would come back again when the bird park is moved to the zoo.
"Good place, nice shows, children like it very much, sepecially the feeding lory at the Lory Loft. It's pity that the water fun at Birdz of Play could not be play without swimming suits."
"Jurong Bird Park is still enjoyable and has a great variety of birds on show. It will soon be moving to a new site out with the Zoo, River Safari and new hotels."
"My friend and I were attracted by the 1 for 1 deal for all the parks, thus we chose to visit Jurong Bird Park which we had both visited during our childhood. We were impressed by the many exhibits as well as the tram which could bring us to see the various exhibits when we got tired, since the park was huge. Also, the bird shows at certain timings of the day was awesome and audience interactive too, so if you volunteer you can easily be wowed by the intelligence of the birds! Overall, I felt that it was an amazing trip down to Jurong Bird Park again to relive my childhood memories."
"In a park we can see diverse birds in the globe. Taking a tram is recommended.ì¸ê³ì ê°ì¢ ìë¥¼ ë³¼ ì ìê³ , ë§¹ê¸ë¥ì ì¼ë¥¼ ë³¼ ì ìë ê³µì. í¸ë¨ì ì´ì©íë©´, ì ë¥ì¥ë§ë¤ ë´ë ¤ì ê´ëíê³  ë¤ì ì ë¥ì¥ê¹ì§ ì´ëíë©´ í¸íë¤. ëì´ ëì  ë¶ë¤ì í¸ë¨ì íê³  ê´ê´íê¸°ë íë¤."
"A great show, free, that showcased a large variety of birds. Very professionally run and entertaining for families. The little kids were spellbound. The performances are twice a day and we saw the morning one at about 11 am. Walking the grounds afterwards we could see some of the performers in their cages. Good places to get a snack or lunch in the bird park."
"It's a very well kept bird park and I loved all the species they have there. I especially enjoyed the section where you could feed the birds. The food is sold right there, so the birds are protected from outside food. They come to you eat the food fearlessly and you can pet them. It's a different kind of experience than just looking at them from far. It was very satisfying for the soul."
It's a bit of a hike to Jurong Bird Park. The East West MRT line will get you as far as Boon Lay station where you can take a bus or a taxi for the last leg of your journey. Buy a voucher on Klook and convert it to tickets at one of the self service machines at the entrance. We watched the King of the Skies show and enjoyed it even though the rah rah commentary became somewhat tedious. The highlight for us was the Lorrie Loft where the Lorikeets have a huge space to zoom around in and are more than happy to pester the visitors for food and attention. Make sure your ticket includes a tram ride to help you traverse the big park in the heat.
Nice to come back again and again as 1 whole day is not enough. Next time I visit I bring with me my parents and parents-in-law. A place to unwind with nature loving ambience and most of all the birds of species that bring a lot of joy specially to the children.
"Having lived in Singapore for over 3 years I thought it was high time to visit the Jurong Bird Park. My mother was visiting from Australia and she loves birds so thought we would venture out. We caught the train out and then connected to a bus which took us straight there (so easy)! I wanted to get there for the bird shows, the first one started at 10am and the next was at 11am. The first one was Kings of the Skies which was teaching you about Hawks and Vultures - excellent show! The second was probably more amusing which was High Flyers. We also went through the Lorry Lorikeet section where the birds were very friendly and would crawl onto your hands and shoulders. I was actually surprised at how big the complex was and there was certainly lots to see. It is a fair walk to get around all the park so suggest you buy a ticket for the train. Singapore does these attractions so well! Recommend a visit if you have an interest in birds but definitely make it for the shows. We left before the feeding times but I am sure that would be interesting as well."
I like the walk-in aviary which had a man-made waterfall.. Good variety of birds and lovely landscape..
"I love this place. It wasn't crowded when we visited. Very quiet, beautiful place to listen to the birds. And then that waterfall!"
"I have rather mixed feelings regarding this park. I went with my 12 year old son and we generally enjoyed the park and the shows. However, transportation back home was a nightmare, as we hadn't found out about Grab at the time (yes, our mistake). But the park closes way after the last buses leave towards the city center, so we basically got stranded and had to use an expensive limo service to get back. And it's FAR from the center!"
Haven't been here since 1988. The park is well looked after. The bird show was fabulous. If you like birds would recommend when visiting Singapore. Taxi from city s$16
"The birds here are amazing. The bird park is very well maintained. Try avoiding the rainy season as the bird shows can get canclled. The highlight is definitely the bird shows. Also a small note flamingos stink alot. I couldn't even stand the smell from 10 feet away the enclosure area. Another place you should definitely visit is the Lori aviary where you can feed the birds while they sit on your hands, a small 3$ price tag for the feeding. They only come on your hand if they are hungry"
"Really easy to get to, catch a bus from the MRT station and it stops right outside (you can use your SMRT tourist card on these busses) include a tram ticket with your entry tickets, hopping on and off the tram can save you a lot of walking on a hot day. We found some of the caged birds a bit hard to see but the aviary is the star, you get to wander around in the forest wilt the birds flying around you. The park is very well laid out, beautiful waterfall and streams. Watch out for the pelicans in the trees above your head....we just missed a bird poo shower really interesting birds of prey show, some huge birds and audience participation. Getting back to town is really easy, the bus back to the MRT stops on the opposite side of the highway (use the underpass). One last point, we found the staff here awesome, really helpful"
The park offers a good opportunity to see lots of interesting birds and has a fair amount of information on the animals. The shows were entertaining but the highlight for me was feeding the lories; these little birds are beautiful and will happily perch or climb on you when you're feeding them.
"The bird park is a long ride on metro and then a bus ride to the park.But the lory loft was worth it. You can buy lory feed and the birds in the huge aviary swoop down to feed from your hand- a great experience.Some of the cages seem a bit small but most are designed with bird's requirements in mind.I would have appreciated some rest areas with shade/cover to help with the relentless heat, but as it outdoor park, not much else can be done.Buy tickets on line for 10% discount"
"If you are a bird lover you'll love this place. We visited in the morning, it is a fairly small park and there were not many people there. Saw lots of colorful parrot varieties. Most cages are situated in a way that you cannot get good photos of the birds, ie glass or chained fence. If you are not a bird and animal lover then you might want to skip this one."
"Jurong Bird Park is a very good natural reserve and a park. There are so many different varieties of birds. The park is built up very nicely. The birds are on a perfect display. If you have children with you while on a trip to Singapore, then please take them there. Children would just absolutely love it. Have fun!"
"A recommended place to visit in Singapore city for nature lovers. Experience tropical forest atmosphere with birds flying around you. I visited this park 20 years ago, and this infrastructures although showed signs of its age, seemed to be well maintained. Vegetation has grown considerably but I could only see 2 paradise birds and the Macau numbers seemed to be much less than decades ago. The Macaus used to be put on display outside without cage but now are confined.But I like the embedded educational messages during the bird shows that teach awareness of the dwindling habitat for animal in the wild."
This little gem surprised us. the bird park is really very good. the shows are a little bit 'cheesy' but tolerable. the quality of the birds is outstanding. Its out of the way but well worth visiting. Not one of the big ones to visit but if you are running out of things to do I would suggest definitely doing it. Its at least a 4-6 hour visit. penguins are excellent
"We visited the bird park after the zoo, so we found it a little underwhelming. It was also really hot with a lot of hills to climb with our 4 year old - so things got pretty tiring quickly. I would recommend it only if you are really into bird watching. Like the Zoo, it has a great outdoor water area for kids though."
"We both enjoyed walking around the Bird Park being fascinated by the variety of birds on display, not to mention every colour under the rainbow. The High Flyers Show was awesome, what a collection of magnificent birds, the training undertaken was incredible. The presenter was engaging and directed the show with great enthusiasm and humor, used to perfection. We thoroughly recommend the Jurong Bird Park to anyone visiting Singapore."
a) bird show was interestingb) it would be good to have more cafe outlet serving lunchesc) it was raining on my visit. it would be good if there are more shelters.d) the walk to the Waterfall is tough for the elderly. it would be good it is more elderly friendly.
"This is a pleasant, family orientated bird park with many varieties of birds in large aviaries. There is a canopied hop on- hop off train on wheels to convey people around the park at a low cost. The pathways are wide and suitable for wheelchairs and the unsteady but there are inclines which could make pushing strollers or wheelchairs hot work. Bring an umbrella, a water bottle, a sunhat and a camera.Bird feeding is a fun experience in The Loft which is at train station one. The Waterfall requires more careful supervision of family members as there are some obstacles and ponds. Supervision is required in the park generally, this is not a place for children to roam or run on ahead. Bathrooms are clean and marked on the map provided at the ticket office."
Jurong Bird Park as usual never fails to excite our children. The children has a lovely time viewing the infinite species of birds and the performance.
"We had a great time there, my 9 years old daughter enjoyed lot! Unfortunately she lost her glass though:)"
when we bought combo ticket for zoo & Bird park we thought the location of both will be adjacent but unfortunately it is located quite far away from zoo.As we all know Singapore is hot & humid hence we should always go for Tram ride during the Bird Park visit.Bird park is full of colourful birds & is divided into zones. The Tram will drop you at location you explore that then take Tram again drop you to next zone. You will change Tram frequently & use whatever is available.
"I love birds & am glad I got to visit this park before it is moved closer to the zoo. I arrived & went into the first aviary where I was admiring the birds when I heard a young man talking to the birds. Turns out he is a regular at the park & known by most of the staff there. He provided me with a personal tour of the park for the day! Lucas wants to be a zoologist & I believe he will make a fabulous one! The park houses so many birds that I don't see in my part of the world. Clean & nicely set in the landscape, this is one of the better bird parks I have been to."
"It was an awesome weather with not much sun, slight drizzle which lasted only few mins. Cooling.. on the signboards says on weekends there's show at 130pm (can't rmb exact time) at Birds of Asia, we were there but See no show..Went to Lory Loft where we donated $3 to buy nectar water to feed the birds, staff on duty were very honest to let us know that it's either there's not many birds around or the birds were fully fed, but we still go ahead.. managed to feed a few birds. Water playground was very much enjoyable for th kids.. they enjoyed themselves very much. There's a nice air-conditioned room with cushions for adults to rest while the kids play.. toilets were clean, just that there is no water heater for shower and the kids were shivering with lips turning purple.. (ceiling Fans were blowing directly over head)The bad experience was at the photo booth, by digi photos, my friend was excited to see his photo on the screen and wanted to snap a photo. Instead of telling him not to do so, a rude staff on duty by the name of, Fatin, hit his hand away! Is that what a customer service crew at places of interest should behave? Yes, my friend may be in the wrong to try taking a photo, but she could have polite ask him not to do so, and if he did, ask him to delete the photo. She should not use physical action. My friend was nice enough to smile at her.. when I approached her to check out what had happened (my sis witnessed the scene and informed me), Fatin was rude and defended herself aggressively! Throwing her belongings into the cupboard unhappily, banging things here and there. I believe she called her superior who came shortly and approached me. He explained to me about her personal issue, apologised on behalf and gave us a card to access the photo online. Logan was professional in handling the situation.Fatin is definitely not suitable for this line if she continues behaving like this. Before this incident, I saw that she was impatient with a group of Korean tourists too."
"Had a very enjoyable experience here, especially the 2 shows in which birds of prey and nocturnal birds were shown, were very engaging and attracted a huge applause from the audiences. The tram ride also helps you to get a glimpse of the entire park."
yet another place in the small city state of Singapore which you must see if you have interest in birds to any small degree. It is a family type park but anyone can go and enjoy
"The park has nice facilities and wide variety of birds (bird shows are awesome) , but the toilets are always very smelly and dirty. Also the food variety is very limited inside the park (hotdogs, pizza, soft drinks etc) and you have to go to the exit for a proper meal. We brought kids there in the morning 10am and in the middle of the visit we can't find any nice food place."
Great shows included in entry fee. Would have been good to have the tram ride included as there is quite a lot of walking in the humid heat. Awesome birdlife.
"Not sure if they are letting this place go down the pan in regards to the structure. I know they are moving from here to the zoo are, so everything is under one roof but that is not till 2020. Don't get me wrong, it is a great day out, there is lots to see. I'm not a fan of the live shows, if you have seen the shows in USA then this is nothing compared to them, but nevertheless, it is worth seeing them. We did not initially take the tram, instead following the map seeing all that there was. The aviary is awesome, buy some food for the birdies and they'll come and sit and eat, it was very nice experience. Once we walked the park, we then took a trip round the park on the tram to see if we had missed anything.There is a shuttle bus that goes to the zoo area but this is only on the hour, so we instead had to get a taxi.Overall, a great day out with lots to see."
"The place was really nice and big and there were many exhibits to explore. I always loved to come here ever since I went as a small kid even though I don't live in Singapore. Many of the birds could be spotted, if you just try hard enough to look for them. Unfortunately a part of the birds of prey exhibit was under renovation when I visited with my friends and that was a bit of a shame. Nevertheless, there are still many cool birds to see. The Lory Loft was crowded and very few lories came to feed from our bird food cup so that was kind of a downer (granted we did come on Vesak Day). They were probably all well-fed already by the previous visitors; we came there around past noon. We had wanted to go to the Waterfall Aviary as well since that was like the main attraction for us but unfortunately again, it rained very hard and we couldn't enjoy that part of the trip. Me and my friend just went and ran into the rain anyways though hahaha. Could be nice for atmospheric rainy shots too near the waterfall which was a very nice scene even in the pouring rain. My tip for visiting here? Definitely go with friends and family, that always makes thing a whole lot more fun. Check the weather forecast first, sunny to cloudy days are the best and you should avoid rain when going here at all costs. The place is pretty big so we did do a hefty amount of walking but if you're used to that, the park will be no problem. If not, you can get a park train ticket for $4 or $5 per adult I'm not sure I forgot. The layout of the place is very convenient as well, it's pretty much a big circle and you'll visit all exhibits by going one round around it which is neat. Food and beverage wise? Those weren't our top priority when visiting because we were too fixated on the awesome birds haha. There are water refill stations around the place and vending machines which is nice. Not a whole lot of food areas scattered around though, they're mostly situated near the entrance. But at least that keeps the park clean too! Check out their website as well it has many useful information! Overall a really nice experience in Jurong Bird Park with me and my friends."
"The shows are great,the lori loft and penguin feeding super.Unfortunately it decided to rain prettily heavily that day and even though there is enough shelter at various points.after 45 minutes we decided to terminate our visit and leave as the birds were all cold and wet themselves.A disposable raincoat is hardly much help,we didn't carry our umbrellas which is mandatory as the weather is erratic.The cafe at lori loft is a good place to wait and have cappucinos as you dry off some dampness from the rains."
We used the tram again at this venue and went to all the shows that are put on at various parts of the park. It is a very full day but so much to see and do and very interesting we are glad we didn't miss it.
"Had my 70 year old Dad with me and a lover of birds and always high on his bucket list'It didn't disapoint' Interactive live show was fantastic and the species and type of birds in the park were amazing'Did get stung by the merchandise photograph, where you get to hold some birds on a stick'$80 for two photos I found very steep and insane' prices weren't advertised anywhere'Had a good day was very clean and ammneities fantastic'Going to be fantastic when all the zoos and bird park are all situated in the one place"
"We went there with a 4-parks combo ticket and we enjoyed it a lot!We took the Metro Green Line to Boon Lay and then at bus interchange we took n.194 bus which brought us to Jurong Bird Park in 10 minutes.We decided to go around on foot (tram is included in the ticket but you still have to get out to see the birds and then there is a long queue to catch it again): first we saw the night birds, then several kingfishers, the lorry loft (a huge aviary with many parrots and also a rope bridge), the area of hornbills and toucans, other parrots, the discovery center (which explains eggs and nests), ostriches and emus, casuari, other large parrots, pelicans, flamingos. We also see 3 beautiful iguanas.Overall we liked it a lot, even though it was very hot because it was humid."
"Courteous staff, awesome shows and colourful birds made our day. Kids get to feed the birds and thoroughly enjoyed that. Keep up the good work."
"Went to Singapore for a holiday and going to bird park was on our list.... Since day 1 of reaching Singapore, my lil one wanted to visit this place...Finally on 3rd day of our trip we went to Jurong bird park.... Took a cab to reach this place as it was the most convenient option... No direct metro service was available and we had to shift from metro to a bus after reaching a point... Didn't want to do any sort of adventure so took a cab...Reached this place around 2pm.... I would recommend people to visit much earlier... As soon as you enter there are people who will take a family snap with birds on your hand... Sounded like fun so went for it. It was a rip off... One picture they charge 30SHD... Also they will block your view so that nobody can click with their personal camera.There are 2 ways of visiting this place... One you can walk around or take a bus trip. We took the bus trip which lasted for 20mins and didn't get to see any birds properly... Visiting this place by feet is the best option....Now coming back to the bird park... You will get to see some amazing birds that you would have never heard of... They have maintained the place so well. The best part of Jurong is their bird shows... It happens every alternate hour. So plan your visit in such a way that you will cover most bird shows... It's incredible to see how well the birds are trained and how the performers keep the audience glued to their seats... The best thing to do in Jurong is to watch the bird shows... Adults and kids both will have super time"
"What a nice day that was for my child he enjoyed a lot especially in the bird show and penguin feeding the bird safari was a little fast so we can""t enjoyed it otherwise all things are good."
A must visit place during Singapore trip. we will get a chance to feed the birds and they organize birds shows as well
"It was my girlfriends birthday on the Sunday we visited and one of her passions are flamingos.We had a lovely walk around the park.I asked one of the staff about the possibility of my friend feeding the flamingos and told him why(they can be fed by the public on weekends and public holidays).He was very kind,and organised it for her.Sadly they are so well fed,only a couple reacted to her,but she was pleased with the experience.Went to one of the shows,which was well done.The birds seem to have as much fun as the audience.Well worth the time"
We reached at 10.00 PM we could complete the tour in 3 hrs.We watched the bird show at their Amphitheater.The ambience is good & the layout of the garden is well planned
We visited this place and found it better than expected. Park was neat and enjoyed spending 3 hours here with family.
"pls try to go at 9.30AM -10AM .You will see penguin feeding /bird show which is their highlight .place is big and trams are there to move around ,i liked to sit it in the tram and take a round of full jurong bird park.you should have full stamina to walk around in the heat . get down at waterfall station and see the same ."
I spent two hours at the bird park on a hot Sunday afternoon and was amazed at the diversity of wildlife. For a few extra dollars you can ride the tram about a 30 minute excursion through the park which let you see the highlights follow that with a walk to see more of the hidden gems here. This is a great family destination there is a lot to do free old and young alike and most of the park is accessible.
"We spent more than half a day here. Quite a huge place. Birds are well-taken care of by professionals. So big we couldn't cover all the species. Penguins right at the beginning was a good start. Had interesting show with Pelican chit chat show, very informative. Good place for some children. We took the tram, which is worth it."
"Such a well laid out venue, unfortunately some displays were closed for renovation. The park is being relocated next to the zoo so that will be amazing. The bird show was entertaining and crowd participation was good"
"We certainly saw a lot of birds, colorful and beautiful. It was nice to have a chance to really see the local birds up close, and think about how they differ from their cousins in other parts of the world. We also saw a lot of local vegetation, which was a nice opportunity as so much of Singapore is developed and paved. I share the mixed feelings that many people have about animals in captivity, on display. To my untrained eye, this seemed humane and the habitat seemed pretty authentic. It had a similar vibe to the San Diego Zoo. The infrastructure for human visitors was nicely maintained, and the personnel were friendly."
Tram queue line is too long. It rained so we were really not able to go around. The shows are great! specially the singing bird!
Great way to escape urban life to relax with nature.A total of 5000 birds from 380 species. All of them in beautiful colors and sounds. Its a huge place so be ready to walk or you can also use the tram which have various stations and give info about some of the exhibits while you pass them.The also have shows for you to enjoy. Overall money spent well
Good place for Families and specially for Kids. They also conduct birds shows at different intervals. Should be included in your trip itinerary.
"Wonderful place for kids and also for bird lovers. Amazing collection of wonderful birds. The most amazing things are the bird shows, one should not miss the shows while roaming to the park."
"Enjoyed the bird shows thoroughly and these should be a must for every visitor. Unfortunately, during our visit it started raining heavily and there was considerable delay in tram car ride due to poor visibility. We couldn't get out of the tram car and had to miss viewing some of the birds. The efforts put in by Jurong Bird Park staff members to maximise our viewing pleasure even under the adverse weather conditions are quite commendable."
Nice park with lots of birds species. I particularly liked the parrots section. Go in the morning as it gets very hot in the afternoon
Another visit to the bird park yesterday before our annual 4 park membership expires. Seems to be quite a few areas under repair at the moment though. The owls seem to have disappeared. And the birds of prey are undergoing a major renovation. Otherwise good to be back.
Tram ride appears to be a short one. The birds show and collection of birds are definitely worth watching.
"Jurong is a must visit for families with kidsBest way to reach is MRT with bus service,takes time but saves moneyThey have pool amphitheatre show and kings of the sky show at 10 am and then 3 pm ,make sure you reach for the morning show so you can leave jurong by 3 pm and try and do river and night safari the same dayThey have an amazing collection of birds ,pelicans ,flamingos ,herons ,macaws, parrots ,toucans ,pigeons ,owls ,hornbills ,peacocks,penguins ..Make sure you cover the whole parkEnjoy the bird feeding ,it's quite uniqueThe shows are fun,especially the pool amphitheatre with macaws, hornbills, the birds do some amazing tricksThe kings of the sky show pales in comparison to the 1stJurong can be covered in 4 hours ,so begin earlyAvoid the curries garden restaurant, which most Indians are tempted to try,the south Indian food is really flat in taste ,dosas ,Vegas are really averageEnjoy a birdy day ..."
"A great place to visit which takes between 2 to 3 hours to see properly. Many magnificent and varying types of birds with good interaction with visitors. Get there early as can get crowded later in the day - opens at 8.30am which would be a good time to arrive. Cost is Sg$30 + $5 for the train. As a lot of walking is involved, I would recommend hiring an electric wheelchair for $20. Taxis turn up often for departing also a van service (10 seater) is available outside near taxi rank for $50 anywhere in Singapore - good value for families and no wait for a taxi. A 10% discount is available on presentation of your Singapore/Silk Air boarding pass."
"This park filled with many kinds of birds from cockatoo, flamingo, pelican, and the cutest pinguin!I prefered to ride tram to go around the park and stop at some stations inside the park. It allowed me to see which points I would like to look furter at (since the area's quite huge).I suggest you to go there in the morning."
"Wonderful Bird park. Takes 3 hours to see the place in its entirety. Check the timings of certain activities to make the most of your visit. The park encompasses a huge area and the variety / collection of species is great, but not as much as Bali Bird Park. Also, at Bali Bird Park, you can take pictures with the birds for free, but over here you need to pay to have a picture taken with the birds. However, the bird research lab at Jurong is really educational and gives good insight into the efforts put in by the team there. As per your liking, this park is suitable for families, friends or even solo persons. Kids will love it here."
"The park is some way from the centre. You can do the MRT / Bus option (according to other TA reviewers) but we chose taxi and had no regrets. About 30 minutes from Orchard road and not expensive at all. Finding a return cab from the Park also proved straightforward.Entrance fees are reasonable - helped by a discount offered if you flew with Singapore Airlines. Don't waste your money on the bus unless you are physically unable to walk, it really is not too challenging to walk the park, even in the heat.Park itself is excellent, lots to see and do. Feeding the parrots was the highlight for our kids, they really do come and sit on your arm for a shot of glucose."
"My son love birds so much and learn so much things but my whole family & relatives were not amazed of the creation how they build the entire place but atleast its a city with park whereby kids & adults gain some knowledge personally.The place was neat & clean but the only thing we noticed was, a huge dome were u can find the FALLS interesting but it was too old and needed some updated architecture.Staff are friendly, good attitude, but amenities are outdated.."
"Situated in Jurong Hill, the Jurong Bird Park is rather far away compared to the other animal parks in Mandai. We took the MRT to Boon Lay and then transfer by bus 194 which dropped us off right next to the bird park. We opted against having lunch with the birds at the park after reading quite a few disappointing reviews about others' experiences and arrived late in the afternoon not knowing what to expect. We had purchased the Park Hopper ticket and so had the tram rides free (for which we thanked our stars since it raining a bit). The park isn't too big and especially with the trams, it can be covered in about 2-3 hours. The park has a good variety of birds and kids would have surely have a great time there.Our best memory at the park was the waterfall aviary. The sound of water crashing against the rocks along with birds chirping away in the background was incredible. It is also a great spot for photography. We spent quite a bit of our time here. Our biggest disappointment would have to be the canceled eagle show at the amphitheater due to rainfall. Alas, there's nothing one can do about that. Nonetheless, it was 3 hours well spent.A note for those using public transport to commute from the park. The bus stop for Boon Lay is on the other side of the road and is not easily detectable. You'll have to cross the under bridge to get there."
"The Jurong bird park is a long way from MRT stations, so would highly recommend a taxi (inexpensive) or a bus.The park itself is a wonderful display of the worlds birds. Very important underlying message of conservation too, which I liked."
"This park is small and if you plan ahead can be covered in half a day. Shows can get cancelled, if the weather doesn't cooperate. It's good to buy a park hopper pass, if you intend to visit the zoo and night safari. Its good to buy the tram ticket."
"My 2 sons and I enjoyed a very informative, yet relaxing outing to the park. I had never thought of going to the bird park, but a visiting friend went there and recommended I take my children, aged 10 and 12. I am glad that I did. We saw so many interesting birds and there was a lot of information, but it was not overwhelming. You can wander around the park or take a tram and get off at the different stops. There is a lot of shade to relax in and multiple places to stop and relax. The only reason that I have not given it a 5/5 is because I think the food choices could be improved on. I understand the bird park is to move nearer the zoo, which I think will be a great improvement and hopefully with the move will come associated healthier meal options. A highly recommended outing in Singapore."
"We traveled from the city on the EW line to Boon lay then transfered to bus No194 which took us directly to the park. On buying our tickets I showed our Singapore airline boarding passes & although we could not get a discount on our tickets the tram ride was free. We arrived at the park around 12.30 in the afternoon planning to tour the park then do the 15.00 &16.00 shows. Firstly we took the tram to Lory Loft to see the Toucans & hornbills. Next we took the tram to the waterfall Aviary. I fell in love with this place, so tranquil with the sound of water splashing & birds singing in the trees. We spent a lot of time here (more than an hour) so we had to miss the last stop to get back in time for the High flyers show at 15.00. As we sat down we could hear the thunder in the distance. The show started at 15.00, but within 5 minutes the heavens opened & there was a torrential downpour, every one ran for cover & I must give the park staff a round of applause for trying to carry on with the show from under the tent, but in the end they had to cancel the show for safety reasons. The noise of the rain on the Canopy was horrendous. Stopped at the Penguin exhibit as it was inside but the rain did not stop & so the kings of the skies show was also cancelled. Stopped for a bite to eat at the Hawk cafe on the way out hoping the rain would stop but it just kept on coming. Luckily the bus stop wasn't to far & we made a quick dash."
It's a lovely place to go with kids various types of birds.. the show times need to be more evenly balanced out so more people can enjoy it.. pls check with show times before going there as the whole place can be covered in 2 to3 hours.. not very stroller friendly so plan accordingly with kids.. nice time to go is usually reach by 2 pm in afternoon and spend time till 6 pm so u can c all the shows.. lot of food options including vegetarian options..
The Jurong Bird Park is conceived very well and it is like no other Bird Park in Asia. Very well maintained and is worth a visit with your family.The shows that they have will truly blow your mind and is a fun activity to do while you are in the park. Dont miss the shows and plan your walk around the park accordingly.You would need 3-5 hours in the park to really cover all the zones and see the shows along the route.Food in the park isn't great and you must consider carrying some basic food. Particularly Vegetarians.Elderly will find it difficult to walk and should opt for the electric carts. Call Jurong Bird Park before you book for senior citizens and ensure they are comfortable.Hope this helps.Cheers -Aby Baldota
"Just ok to visit, I would prefer JB ZOO instead cheap and betterFind little costly. Teen kids will love it still."
"I'm not overly big on birds, and even less excited about bird parks - seeing birds in cages tends to depress me. But this place is pretty great, especially the waterfall enclosure, which is over a hectare or more in size. The habitat inside is amazing. They park is doing a lot of captive breeding, to grow their collection for the new park in a few years. Its a good place to go to learn about all the endangered species and the threats on them."
Jurong Bird Park is a place where you can take your entire family and people of all ages will enjoy. Its recommended to reach this place im the morning as they have various bird shows which one must attend. The highlight of the place are the penguins and the Macaos. You can also feed the birds which is also a great experience.
A great place to spend the whole day. A great collection of birds. The shows were well organised and it was a treat to see the rapport between the birds and their trainers.Theride inside the park is really helpful and saves a lot of walking between exhibits
"We took our 1.5 year old to the bird park and it was an enjoyable experience. It has been made so child friendly that it's a treat and allows parents to enjoy their day out too.The entire bird park is well signed and together with the maps easy to navigate with a stroller. They also provide the option of a tram like vehicle should you get tired of walking. There are adequate bathroom and diaper changing facilities and also places to take a break and eat etc.All of us enjoyed the bird displays especially the penguins, the hornbills and toucans, emu, ostrich."
"My daughter had an enjoyable sunday finding easter eggs, having her favorite penguins n flamingo was a MUST!We enjoy the show too!Had a great family outing.Thanks you Jurong Bird Park."
We had a great day at the bird park. There is a good range of local and non local birds.The one thing that I found disappointing was that not all signs indicated the provenance of the birds.
"An excellent family outing venue for all ages. The Park is clean, staff are professional and cheerful. The bird are pretty and the most memorable are both the bird shows."
"This is the 4rth time i have been to jurong Bird park, recent one was with my daughter 2yrs old, she just loved watching the penguin's, was hard for me to get her eyes off.. it also has a play area for kids, who can get soaked in water.. This bird park has too many varieties of parrots, diverse collection of birds... Its a small and lovely place to bring your kids and spend the whole day without any fuss for food or enjoyment.."
"Jurong Bird Park was both interesting and different although I've got to say that this was not the best bird park I have visited.The ""bird show"" itself was directed towards families with young children, which is certainly a good thing but perhaps not quite so captivating for those of us who were older.I'm sure that the bird park would be excellent for those intent on recording their experiences through their cameras.Well worth a visit."
Good- The shows were fantastic - highly educational and entertaining- The water park was a great way to keep my three year old occupied for an hour and a half - he had a whale of a time splashing around- The tram ride was enjoyable (tip - better to take the tram after lunch and after the shows when the hoards of tourists are gone)- my toddler enjoyed the paleontologist pit as wellcan be improved- changing rooms and toilets were very clean- food was mediocre
"We held our team bonding at Jurong Bird Park on Easter Sunday. Our team members were made up of mostly seniors (above 60 years old). We were very grateful to the staff for their considerations and accommodation!Visually captivating - our seniors were liven up by the vibrant colours, vast variety of birds and their flights also energized them! Most of them had not visited the Jurong Bird Park for more than 10 years. It was reminiscing and they did a walk down the memory lane.Inclusive - We also noticed that the multi-lingual introduction panels at Lory Loft included Braille for the visually-impaired visitors. There are regular tram services and gradual slopes to facilitate mobility.Our seniors were happy with the team bonding session carried out and created a lot more happy memories at the Hanging Bridge, Waterfall Aviary and Heliconia Walk. Thank you Jurong Bird Park!"
This bird park is fabulous - the most impressive are the walk in aviaries especially where you can feed the birds.I am as not comfortable with some of the smaller cages for the smallest birds and definitely not impressed that the biggest birds and birds of prey are in smaller cages than the colourful Australian birds. I would like to walk through a covered area into a massive bird of prey area.I am opposed to the concept of caged animals and for the most part was impressed with this park with the exception of the birds of prey. I believe They could do with even more space
"This is Asia's largest bird paradise over 5000 colorful birds across 400 species. We enjoyed watching these beautiful creatures, penguins can be seen at the entrance, macaus birds was fun to watch and got the chance to hold birds in wooden sticks. There is also a tram service which you can avail to make you feel relax by not walking and if you are travelling with children. It also has tallest man-made waterfall which will mesmerize you by its beauty.Recommended Tour Duration: 2 hoursHow to reach ' MRT (Boon lay station) and then take Bus No. 194.Opening Time: 8:30 AM to 6 PM"
engaging performances & interesting array of species to look at n learn from wonderful nature sanctuary
Its a 3-4 hrs nice getaway for kids. Bird show is also great. Preferably walk than taking tram if you want to take a look at birds. Not many eating options here. Its far from city center.
"There are a wide range of birds in this relatively compact park. There is a lovely aviary where some beautiful peacocks and other birds wandering around.Amazing to see swans, flamingoes and beautiful parrots all in one park!RegardsOmar"
The kids had so much fun with the egg hunt and watching the bird show at the amphitheater. A good place to spend your day with young children
"The bird park is good 3 to 4 hours fun. All shows are good. There is tram service if you have small children with you then it is easier with tram.Go early before 10 am then you can cover a lot , later in the afternoon the place gets very crowded."
"Eat the laksa in the restaurant just at exit of Bird Park. You will love it, in the air conditioned restaurant"
"I spent over 3 hours in the afternoon but could easily have spent longer as the 3 shows I watched took up nearly 1/2 the time. Fabulous setup. Loved the ability to interact with birds & for a small coin donation could feed or water them in one of the aviaries. Impressively laid out with a $5 tram to take you around if you get tired of walking. Loved the recycled drinking water dispensers at all the toilet blocks, excellent! Several eateries shops around the site also."
"The bird park is tucked away on the west of Singapore so it is located some distance away from the other wildlife parks. So it's harder to hop from one park to another if you decide to go there. Nevertheless, the park is well maintained and there was a variety of birds that were all taken good care of. It was a unique and delightful experience!"
"This tourist attraction takes about 4 hours to complete if you want to see every single attraction. It is better to go early because there are several shows during the whole day and if you go late you may miss some of them. Must see attractions: Lory Loft, Waterfall Aviary. Also do not miss the parrots show and hawk show."
If you are bird's loveryou must be here.lots of birds species.Amazing.Hot weather and humidity makes tour limited but you will get over.
"if your with family in Singapore this place is a must , very big collection of birds the big huge feeding cage is a wow ,sad about the birds of pray being in small cages but there must be a reason for that. lots of fine gifts for back home , loved the place."
"A place where every adult/teen and kids will rejoice and forever.DO REMEMBER TO TAKE BIRD PARK MAP which are available at entry of zoo, it is really helpful.Up and close encounter with all the species (Wild and Terrain Birds like Vulture etc), Session with Exotic birds and Swams..The Bird park is very outside of city and will take approx 1 hour to reach, once there you can get in and host of restaurants available for refreshments.Jurong Bird park is must visit and prepare to walk a lot as the inter transport is available but it won't stop at specific animal point as the bus will stop at his station only.But a good walking will take you at all attractions of Birds."
"I brought my daughter and her friend who are 8 years old to the Jurong Bird Park during the school holiday. They had a great day exploring every single corner and visited all bird species there. They loved the close interaction opportunities with the free roaming birds in many of the enclosures. The explanation are clear, but they find it quite hard to spot some of the birds, especially the eagles. It's a pity that the owl enclosure was closed. It used to be the most exciting part of the visit when they were much younger. They learned a lot at the Breeding and Research Centre too."
"I went there before few years back it was really fascinating. But this time around seems somewhat unkempt. Nevertheless, i think we should give our support as it is not easy and not cheap to maintain this park."
"Maybe I was lucky but there were no queues when I went, despite what I'd read on trip advisor. After the metro, walk 100m through the mall ( just follow the signs) get the bus 2 stops to the park. There was a little train going through the park for $3. You can get on and off at any of the 3 stops. Worth every penny. The bird park itself was ok but it wasn't top of my list of things to do. The indoor waterfall was lovely and the general walk around very nice too. The blue macaws were my favourite as I hadn't seen them before. At Lori loft I saw 2 little birds only. The high flyers show was very good and enjoyed by all. As an optional extra you can hire disabled scooters, $38 strollers and trundle trucks (for the kids) for the day"
Very interesting to watch the shows in the Jurong Bird park. Usually the shows will be done once in the morning and once again in the afternoon. So plan the time accordingly. If you want to walk slowly and enjoy the day in nature you can comfortably spend a day in this park. The climate will be more humid so go with the comfortable outfits and water bottle. Drinking water point is available at many locations where you can fill your bottle. The park keepers are very friendly and I'm sure you'll enjoy your trip. Suits for all ages of visitors.
We took our 18month old daughter here and she loved it. The penguins and many types of hornbill were a particular highlight for all of us. However it is very difficult to get a stroller around unless u just follow the road. No signage indicating steps ahead in places meant a few u turns with a loaded up stroller. We did have a great time and the kids water park is also a great feature. Having an annual pass for the zoo means we'll defo be back again.
Very interesting. Loved seeing so many different types of birds. Quite big and very nice to walk around.Will definitely visit again
I had been to the Bird Park when I lived in Singapore - back in 2013 and previously many years ago. It is looking a bit tired in places but a nice way to spend a few hours. The birds are beautiful and it great to be able to go into the Lori Loft and have the birds land on you and feed from a small cup of bird food that you can purchase. There are a few places to eat and a gift shop. If you can ride the small tram and hop on and off at the exhibits. The cost of taxi from the city to the park was approximately $25.
"So many variety of birds, and some great shows worth a visit , ypou can reach this place via MRT and the a short journey via bus 194 which also drops you back to the MRT on your return , if you have a MRT card the same can be used for your bus ride , you can buy your tickets to the park online at a discount"
Properly organized and clean. Kids will enjoy looking at the many types of birds in the park. Friendly staff.
The bird park allows us to connect with various species of birds! Just fascinating! The bird shows were just mesmerising! Cant wait to go back!
"After a journey of just over an hour using the MRT and then a bus we arrived at the bird park. We opted to use the tram as we didn't have a great deal of time but we would have been quicker walking as we had to queue for 20 minutes to use the tram. (I think the $5 fee to use the tram is a bit steep). It is quite a hilly park so the walk wouldn't suite everyone, especially on a hot day.The park however is lovely with a vast variety of birds, some of which are endangered. It's reassuring to see that the park is working hard towards the conservation of birds like the Macaw and not just opening as a tourist attraction.On leaving we joined the queue for a taxi and waited 30 minutes before it was our turn. Fortunately it was only a 20 minute drive back to our hotel."
It's been decades since my last visit to the park and it's still fun and educational. Some of the highlights such as the loft was really good.
"My family, including 5 year old son, thoroughly enjoyed our visit. There is a lot of walking and much of it is hilly. Much of it has little shade!! There are ""trains"" but they are not so convenient and often very long ques for them. The penguins, with so many breeds was amazing. The birds are well kept. 2-3 hours is about the time needed. It is quite a ride to get there. We had to wait quite a long time, in the heat, to get a taxi back into the city"
"for me, there were 45 highlights... penguins, african penguins, blue macaws, Cassowary and bird breeding place! they really do take care of their birds.. all birds looks pretty healthy and seems to have enough space to fly around and hideout, if they don't feel like revealing themselves. this is something i really admire.they also have a really tall human-made waterfall inside the park with the upper walking area, which let you get closer to the birds. some of the free-flying birds are sooo use to humans, that they don't even bother to fly away like the birds we find back at home; in fact, they comfortably walk around and fly off when they feel like. some birds even gives you perfect poses!like in the zoo, each category of birds have it's own museum sort area and they have really educating bird shows as well. it can get really tiring, so always carry something cool and water with you. also don't forget to take the advantage of their tramp ride... you going to need it!this a very family experience which can take from good 4-6hrs.. better not schedule anything else till night, because it can get very tiring. Also, go early as possible :)There is no straight MRT stop. you need to get down from Boon Lay and then get 194."
"As birding people, we went to the Bird Park to see some of the non-captive inhabitants as well as the beautiful captive birds. We came by taxi from Orchard Rd and came after 10 am to avoid the traffic but going back, we were caught up, so try to leave by 3.30 or else use public transport.The flight aviaries are spectacular and the birds easy to see. Some of the identification signage does not include all the birds in that aviary but is mostly good. The birds are beautiful and range from small to large, colourful to fairly plain and very loud to very quiet. I would recommend the Lory Loft, the hornbills and the Waterfall aviary. There are plenty of shelters if it rains and small cafes dotted around the site. If you can't stand the humidity, I would recommend paying a little extra for the tram to get from place to place. The bird show was a bit kitsch for me but others really enjoyed it. The layout is really good and straightforward so there is little backtracking. This is a very worthwhile place to spend some of your time."
"Enjoyed the walking on the lake trail by the flamingo. But unlike other three, here, most of the bird is inside metal cage, which hamper viewing capability. It would be nice, if they are inside glass cage."
This is by far the best bird park i have ever seen nor have I seen so many different species of birds. It is a very well maintained park. You even get opportunity to click a photograph with the parrot sitting on your hand. You can even feed the pelicans. There are few bird shows as well. For the ones who cannot walk a lot there is a tram inside as well. Overall we can spend close to 3 hours in the bird park.
"First of all the place has a 100 ft waterfall and rainforest created where birds and animals roam around happily. Many pigeons and peacocks are a Geet away strolling freely . It's beautiful. Then they have a huge collection of parrots, toucans and hornbills which are kept in big enclosures . The flamingos are orange and beautiful. We fed the African penguins which was the highlight of our visit. They also have giant sized penguins. The birds of prey show was nice with huge kites, cultures and eagles strutting around."
"Beautiful place to see, gorgeous surroundingsA huge variety of birdsTo tell the truth not really my thing but the kids loved feeding the birds and they have a great waterpark for the kids"
This is a lovely park with amazing birds. Take advantage of the land train to hop on and off at different parts of the park as it is very hot. We went by subway train and a bus and it took one and a quarter hours. We took a taxi back which was so much easier
"I believe Jurong Bird Park has changed alot since my last visit was decades ago. It is definitely a fun place to bring the kids around, rather than letting them glued to the ipads and handphones. A nice place for family bonding as well."
"One of Singapore's major wildlife parks, the Jurong Bird Park is a must-see if you're at all fond of bird life. Set across many acres of well-wooded landscape, with lots of towering trees, water bodies and aviaries of different types and sizes, the bird park gives you a real bird's eye view of the world's avifauna. A road (flanked on both sides by beautiful heliconia shrubs with vivid red and yellow flowers) marks the route right through the park, and trams travel along these, stopping at designated tram stops along the way to allow hop-on hop-off travel. There are secondary pathways that you can traverse only on foot.Among the most intriguing and spectacular sections we saw were the ones that allow visitors to get up close to the birds: the aviaries where you walk right in. The raptors, hornbills, toucans, birds of paradise, parrots, etc are all in cages (all very large, rest assured), but the pelicans and the flamingoes are out in the open on lakes, and two massive aviaries'the Lory Loft (which houses about a thousand lorikeets) and the Waterfall Aviary (the highlight of which is a 35 mt high waterfall)'allow you to really cross paths with some lovely birds. We oohed and aahed over gorgeous crowned pigeons, brilliantly coloured finches, parrots, macaws, peafowl, and more, watched them feeding just an arm's length away, and got a chance to see many species we'd never even heard about before.One of the most informative sections is the Bird Discovery Centre, a small and compact space that, across a handful of rooms, uses text, pictures, stuffed specimens and more to explain birds: their beaks, their bodies, their feeding and reproduction, human inventions inspired by birds, and more.There is also a children's play area that is bird-themed (we couldn't visit this because, due to some corporate function, the park shut early on the day we visited). There are also various souvenir shops, eateries, toilets, etc dotted across the park. Do remember to pick up a park map and brochure (available free at the entrance), which also includes a comprehensive listing of feeding times for different birds'it's a good way of getting to see them'as well as the timings for different shows at the park.The only show we were able to go to was the High Flyers one, which showcases some interesting skills'flying/manoeuvring, dexterity, vocal mimicry, etc by an array of birds such as parrots, hornbills, and so on. Our toddler, whose fourth birthday it was in the day we visited, was absolutely thrilled that the parrot on the compere's wrist actually sang 'Happy birthday to you' to all those in the audience (including, of course, our daughter) who were celebrating their birthday on that day. The show ended with a delightful grand finale consisting of dozens of birds of different species waddling into the amphitheatre and filling it with sound and colour.We loved this place. The only drawback of it being a rainy day (it drizzled throughout, in varying intensity) was that since about 95% of the birds are out in the open (even the aviaries are covered in the top only by mesh), you get wet if you aren't carrying an umbrella or wearing a raincoat. Either way, taking photos gets a bit difficult."
"Time your visit to be there early morning, so you can finish with the 11am bird tour. That way you can avoid the hottest part of the day. Lots of birds on display, with some fun areas where you can get real close to the birds."
"Singapore's very own famous bird park. This has evolved over the years and is a great visit for kids and the old alike. Lots of interaction with the birds in different ways - feeding, shows etc."
This is a must visit attraction while in singapore.There are a large no of different birds in their natural environment.Tram is easily available for those who are not able to walk and it stops at 3-4 stations from where one can see the enclosures.Hornbills were particularly beautiful.
"Asia's largest bird park houses 5,000 birds across 400 species. Many of them roam free as we saw birds that were not in their designated signed enclosures. It was sad to see large Birds of Prey in wired cages too small for them but otherwise; it is a well thought out Bird Park. Our favorite was the Waterfall Aviary where we watched a Taveta Golden Weaver painstakingly construct his nest out of foliage and twigs. Another fun bird to watch was the Common Crowned Pigeon who didn't mind us being within a foot of it to take pictures. We could have stayed all day. Make sure to put on bug spray before you go!Take the East-West MRT line bound for Tuas Link, and alight at Boon Lay (EW27). From the Boon Lay bus interchange, take Bus No. 194, which will take you straight to Jurong Bird Park."
"I wojuld rather have gone to the zoo, but we ended up here on a very hot day and thank goodness for the little train that drives you around because I was too hot to wak. Everything is well laid out and organized in sections according to bird type. The colourful birds are lovely, the flamingoes too. I enjoyed seeing the little penguins diving and swimming. It doesn't take that long to cover the area, maybe an hour. There are facilitites there too for eating and shopping (of course.) I think the price is a little steep for entry."
"I was helping out at a One Community Fiesta event as first aiders and took the opportunity to walk around the Bird Park to have another appreciation of the Park before it moved to Mandai in 2020. This was not the first time I came to this Bird Park. The last two occasions we were fascinated by the bird shows but this time I just walked around quickly to have a glimpse if there is anything different. Frankly speaking, I don;t really have much interest in aviary species and even if they appeared very colorful to me, I don't really will read more about it.But I was surprised to see one section of the park labeled as `Dinosaur Descendants' and include such birds like Emu, ostrich, etc. How does dinosaurs evolved into birds? How does feathers and wings formed in dinosaurs? I was curious and started reading up on this area and found that evidence were found in fossils linking similar bone structure between one type of dinosaurs and birds. Similarity was also found in the evolution of the skull. I really could not believe this theory. But scientists are talking about evolution over millions of years and I thought of Darwin and the evolution of man from apes.As I returned to the main hall of activities and looking out from the glass door, I could see the stunning view of the many beautiful and colorful flamingos playing in the lake. But deep in my mind, I still wondered if these meek and slender flamingos could have evolved from dinosaurs.It is thought provoking this time to visit the Jurong Bird Park and strongly suggest you visit the park before it moved to Mandai in 2020. ."
This place is ideal for the Bird Lovers. And there is an spectacular Bird Show at the Amphitheater (Check their websites for the show times). This is little bit far from the city center so better go there early. Tickets for Singapore Zoo also can buy at this place to avoid queues if you plan to go there after the Bird Park. (I prefer 1st visit to Bird park and then to Zoo as the Night Safari should not be missed at the Zoo. Anyway there is a plan to merge the Jurong Bird park with the Zoo in future...
"Shows are great, disappointed with Sky hawk show. Need to get some more wild birds.Time well spent."
"Of all the zoo parks I enjoyed this one the most - the show was good. some areas of the park are starting to look a bit tired but they are moving the park to be beside the zoo, that is due to open in couple of years."
There are so many such parks in the world but they are running some nature and environment saving programs . Bird show parrot and hawk show are good to watch. they ensure your participation too.
All the shows are really good and entertaining. Very nice use of space with lots of plants and greenery which keeps the park relatively cool. We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. The concept of having a bird show at the buffet restaurant is a good one. Lucky for us it wasn't crowded at all.
About 20mn outside the city but worth the drive... don't bother getting the tram ticket... just walk! There's lots to see! Highlight was the parrot exhibits...
"like everything in Singapore, its done right. presentation, information,service, feel, calmness, clean,"
"A must see place in SG. you find different colours of birds of different sizes. I have also visited Bird Park in Kaula Lumpuer, Malaysia. I felt Malaysia bird park is bigger than this place. People who have not seen Malaysia, this will be definitely a good attraction. Please go by walk instead of taking a battery car. You can see more place if you go by walk"
Loved the bird park . Enjoyed the shows ... Most enjoyable was Penguin feeding ....It was my second visit since I last visited in 2004... Changed a bit but shows looked pretty the same .. Food & drinks availability was better ... Kids loved the small water play area
"A nice place to visit, although if you cannot walk long distance, suggest you take the tram, as there is plenty of uphill trek. Wide range of birds, dont miss the bird show. Only setback is it is rather far from town (45min - 1hour)"
the only problem was it being away from the other 3 safaris but it was a good park lots of variety.by next year authorities will shift it closer so good.our kids loved the option of clicking snaps with the birds close to them.the bird show i highly recommend.try taking middle row seats.the volunteers are picked from there and if you are lucky a flying bird might just come and sit on your hand.
we could not see properly the park because of heavy rains however its a must do place while in the city
"Jurong Bird Park is a must watch for any bird lover and even if you are not a bird lover you will stil love the experience of visiting this place .. in urbanised Singapore, this is one of the many places where you can feel close to nature.. the place is beautifully maintained and they have a huge variety of birds and Engage people with a lot of activitiesThe place is a mus visit for at least Kids ad they would really love the activities and shows that they do out thereThe food at the restaurant was also quite good event though slightly on the higher side"
"The bird park was fantastic., with birds not only from Singapore but other parts of the world.There are many opportunities to photograph colourful bird, if fact all birds.They have a bird display at the coffee shop where birds preform various tasks, they had three different colored Macaws which made great photos.For some reason it was much cooler in the bird park, a relief from the hot sun.There were also mobility scooters if you are not to good on your feet.It was a great experience and I would love to go back"
"Beautiful greenery teeming with the chirping of birds. The bird park with its shows and little tram was simply refreshing. We did it on our last day in Singapore and Jurong lived up to its expectations. The lory loft, birds of paradise, the waterfall aviary, the flamingoes were all exceptional. Neat well maintained place."
Amazing collection of birdsBuild so close to realityFantastic animals showNever miss it for childrenStrongly recommend for 5 to 7 hours or full day to enjoy it
A super way to spend time with family and kids. Watch the shows and try to be there during the feeding times.
The birds the greenery and the bird shows at Jurong bird park were great the kids just loved them. The special samba brazilian dance was an added bonus on the 31st of december when we visited .The tram rides and the photo shoot with the birds made it a special memory indeed!
"We had a great time at Jurong Bird Park. There was a huge variety of wildlife to see and the park is clean and well kept. I love the refill water bottle stations, should be more of them in Singapore in general. I was also pleased to see that the 4 parks will all be in close proximity in the near future."
"This is real tropical rainforest with best facilities for tourists. The place is good to go in 1st half of the day and accessible by MRT with complimentary shuttles. Reach by 9:30 so you can enjoy free shows at 10 and 11 am. Also can visit many birds feeding sessions. Kids enjoy. We saw rare blue Macaw( fame of Rio movie) during special fest. The tram is not worth unless of course you have elderly or kids who don't want to walk. The Park can be covered maximum in 3 hours. You get discounts on online booking and various agents even with Singapore airlines but they all include Tram tickets. And Tram has big queues on Station 1, skip that and catch up tram from other stations if you have tickets. Lots of free refill water stations( the best change I saw in Singapore: an effort to reduce single use plastics- KUDOS) and lots of eating options too. Pizza Hut and Indian restaurant"
Nice day at the Bird Park. Wish there was more to see at the Park. The best attraction was definitely the Hawk Arena where they have the birds of preys show.
"Love the shows provided there. the kids enjoy the waterplay park especially during the hot weather. sadly, I find it hard to find halal food. The only available option is pizza hut. Perhaps the park can consider having more halal food options"
"If you planning to visit Singapore Zoo or have been to bird sanctuaries elsewhere, you can skip this. We took the inside tram as we were short on time, birds are in excellent conditions. Loved the kiwis. You can bring your food. Water fountains and clean washrooms everywhere. Kids play area is cool so don't forget to pack their swim wear. Their Photo booth is a money rip off. Unlike the Chimelong Safari Park in Guangzhou you can't really touch birds."
"Nice day out with the family. When you arrive, start by taking the trolley around the whole park to figure out what you want to see, and then walk to those places. Distances are short and signs are good, so it's easy to find your way around.Don't forget to feed the adorable Lori parrots."
great day for bird lovers. really great seeing the blue macaws. we bought the team ticket for around the park but it's not really worth it. just walk and check out all the exhibits.it was a bit of a trek to get there on public transport. we ended up getting an uber home for about $20.
Went here with my family. They have some amazing collection of birds from all around the globe.Booked combined package from the official website with Singapore zoo and River safari tickets which turned out to be a good deal for us.Park is slightly away from Chinatown downtown where we were staying (about 40 minute drive by cab)Takes approximately 4 hours at least to cover the entire zone. Also they have amazing bird shows which are interesting and must watch. Apart from this there is also option to feed birds and penguins if you want.Overall a nice place for family outing!
"The place is a bit overrated. Not saying it's bad but it does not live up-to the amount of publicity it gets. There are different types of birds from all around the world, which is not very unique as it is a common feature in most bird sanctuaries. The live shows have a very odd timing so it is not possible to catch all of them. Rest is good. If you have some spare time, do visit it. It won't disappoint you."
Brought kids there in hope of some water play but it was under renovation. Should be informed and refund should be made.
"A wide variety of birdlife, the flamingoes were the highlight for me, three species on site. The trai ed parrots were a popular spectacle."
"We only managed to cover a tram ride from main gate to the 4th station and walk back to main gate for exit as kids were getting tired. From 4th station, we visited the parrot area and saw some pelicans and storks on the way with our rented wagon. We also had lunch at the buffet place which has ""lunch with parrot"" show (2pm) which is quite enjoyable for older kids. Buffet spread was fine but not great. SGD25/adult. Overall quite a nice place to visit."
Its been a few years since my last trip to the Jurong Bird Park.There has been some new exhibits such as the blue macaws.My family and I like the close interractions with some of the birds especially the lory.The waterfall Aviary has more birds roaming around too.
"Impressive and much has changed since last visit 10 years ago.New renovation and landscape,live show was quite stunning."
Interesting exhibits esp on the blue macaws but not sure why owls exhibit was no longer around. Highly recommended for kids!
"We were early at the bird park a few minutes after it opened and that allowed us more time to view the birds and take photos without having people crowding around. Weather was humid as usual but overall, the walk was enjoyable. The variety of birds are limited though and many facilities such as cafe, children play area were not open despite it being a Sunday."
You can see different species of birds and enjoy a wonderful show. Click a lot of pictures. Its well maintained with eateries so no issue of food.
"Overall it's very good and the park has quite a variety of birds. However, during our visit last Saturday, my toddler daughter was very disappointed that the ostrich wasn't there (I think the place has been replaced by a stork, next to the cassowary).It could also be better if there are more sheltered seats along the way."
"We visited the Jurong Bird Park a year ago - it was a very pleasant outing with large aviaries for birds we do not see in Europe.The park is well kept and laid out. The birds seem well fed and contented with their spaces. However, we did not enjoyed the parrots aviaries section which seemed toosmall and the birds seemed to try to escape by pecking at the cages.The flamingos and pelicans seemed happy and had large areas to roam about.Jurong Park is a good place to visit if you stay in Singapore for a while."
Jurong Bird Park is home to numerous birds of the world. It is Asia's largest bird park with a collection of more than 380 species. The open concept Flamingo Lake is another must-see where hundreds of greater and lesser flamingos strut around one of the most picturesque sights in the Park.Opening Time is 08:30 AM and closing time is 06:30 PM.The best way to come to the park is through the East West Line (MRT) till Noon Lay and then change over to Bus No. 194 from Boon Lay to Jurong Bird Park.
"Truly a worthwhile visit, although I would not recommend any additional expenditure such as bird feeding. King of the skies and other events held across the day in park premises and feeding sessions with penguins are a must attend."
"Firstly, here's a disclaimer!! Am not really interested in birds and animals so this place wasn't as hooking as others however if you are a bird lover than believe me this place is heaven for you. Me being a non bird lover didn't get bored at all. I really loved the 2 shows over there."
"We booked the tickets online and therefore, did not have to stand in queue to book our tickets. Unless it is the peak season there hardly is much of a queue, anyway.The upkeep of the park is impeccable. If you do not like walking for long periods of time, the tram ride is strongly recommended. But there has to be a better way to check if everyone availing the tram ride has actually paid for it. The tram driver (who doubles as a conductor), at every stop, will check your ticket.The overall experience was grand and we managed to watch only the Birds of Prey show which was quite enjoyable. The complete experience of the park will consume at least 6 hours of your time.Due to maintenance work one of the exhibits was closed to tourists. As a gesture of goodwill and courtesy, the management could have gone the extra mile and refunded a part of the entry fee to all tourists who visited the park that day.Amidst the concrete jungles of Singapore, Jurong Bird Park is a pleasant sight to the sore eyes."
"we do enjoy all the collection of birds in the park, and it is easy to pass time with all the family together. Picnic is also great in the park."
Good but a bit old. Excellent staff. Keep it up! Went on a Saturday but no crowd.Its time for a revamp.
This bird park has more than 400 species of birds...it is better if you visit this place in the morning so that you can watch the bird shows which are actually very nice and amazing..this place has a vast area of kids to play as well..very well maintained and beautiful place to visit if you are visiting Singapore..
"A good place to see birds from all over the world, some quite intresting ones and in natural surroundings. A place that would be best enjoyed in a full day trip. Check the show timings to pre-plan the route."
The bird park was tranquil and pretty. We saw many birds that we had never seen before. We stopped for an ice cream in one of the cafes to cool off and really enjoyed our time at the park.
"Took ourselves to Jurong Bird Park. Started with a trip from Navena station to Jurong East on the MRT, this was a amazing experience. Trains are clean and every 5 minutes. Arriving at Jurong a short walk to the taxi rank were a transport officer opens the car door for passengers.A drive of approx 15 mins and we arrive at the entrance to the Bird Park. First sight is a display with many species of parrots and the opportunity to have a photo taken. Grab a Park map and hop on the tram for a leisurely trip to station 1. Leave the tram and wander through the displays then pick up the tram again to the next station.Outstanding displays although some appeared empty but actually birds were nesting so not visible.We did not do the Australian section, we know our birds but rest of Park is very good, you have the opportunity to get close and personnel with the parrots and feed them, have your photo taken with them.Told that in 5years Bird Park will be located with Singapore Zoo, good idea as both are an island apart.Cab back to Jurong station, MTR back to Navena station and bus back to hotel. What top day."
"Its my 3rd visit to Jurong Bird Park, the last being about 8 years ago. Overall the park has many positive changes. Feeding of the birds at Lory Loft was the best experience for me, my wife and my 7 yr old son.The water play area was a plus and the bird enclosures were properly marked and well maintained. We spent about 3 to 4 hours and went home with good moments."
I have visited the park many times over the years but i realised i have missed the hornbills and toucan exhibits all these while! That was the highlight of the visit this time round. Unfortunately we were stuck at the waterfall aviary afterwards due to heavy rain and there was no sheltered walkway to get to the tram station. But we managed to visit most of the places we wanted before that. Sad to find that world of darkness exhibit was gone and the emperor penguins seems to be missing from the penguin exhibit.
"too nice place to visit. great experience, beautiful birds, great place to spend 2 - 3 hours at least."
"Visited the Bird Park with a 3 year old and a 7 year old, they had an amazing time there. Truly, memories are made of this, and it was a wonderful holiday in Singapore."
Jurong Bird Park is one of its kind bird park in the world. a must visit. lunch with the birds is a beautiful show you should not miss it
We were there in April this year and the park is absolutely amazing.My 3 year old literally loved it as it has everything from shows to bird feeding to train rides.Its quite a big park so you are in it for a whole day but you can rest eat and also use train/buggy rides to roam around.All types of birds are there so you can choose your pick and visit what you like first.It seems you are so close to nature when you are visiting this one that the feeling is just awesome .A happy kid is what you need on a trip so a must do in Singapore.
"Housing some very exotic and also large birds it's an attraction for all ages. You can feed some of the birds and even let the lorikeets climb and land on you in the lorry loft. Birds of prey exhibit, bird shows and the incubation nursery are highlights."
"The experience was amazing. From tiny penguins, colorful Macau, parakeet to 'Kings of the Skies'. They were all so well bred and well taken care of.The ambiance of the bird park was great and the largest man made waterfall in a Bird Park...they thought of a perfect place for the birds, while showing them off to the world. That is simply world-class."
Good fun place for young children. Lory loft feeding the birds is super fun. Reached easily in taxi . Takes about 4 hours if you see all the displays. I felt that the photographs taken and sold by the bird park right at the entrance of thewas exorbitantly over priced. We hired a trolley for our kid at 9 $ comes very handy. There is a Indian restaurant right at the entrance .. not great but can try. Must see in Singapore
If you like Birds this is the place for you. All species a very enjoyable morning wandering around the beautiful park.
"If you really want to enjoy the Bird Park, it is all about timing, for example, the Kings of the Sky show featuring eagles, vultures, hawks, and owls, starts at 10am and 4pm, during my last visit, we decided to go after lunch, we were there around 1.30pm, taking a stroll, we visited the penguins, macaws, etc. then we stopped for the pelicans' show at 2.30pm. After which we proceed to walk around other exhibits, stopping at the Waterfall Aviary at 3pm for the feeding of the birds. After that, we took a stroll to other exhibits and arriving at the Hawk Center for the Kings of the Sky show at 4pm. My son had an incredible enjoyable time as it was well paced out, and we are not rushing from one point to the other."
"Good but too many speaking. If it is only show n music, it is more interesting. Bird park visit with tram is good but too little of bird. Sometime dunno where they r located in the cage."
I have seen some very rare birds in this park. Value for money. I spent almost 4 hours in the park and that was not enough. You should spend whole day here. Dont miss the Brid shows.
"Great experience, Good shows. Check out the weather (rain) before visit. Park is clean and well maintained."
"Excellent place to view some amazing birds . Excellent pics , especially birds with vibrant colours."
"Nice park with many wonderful birds, unfortunately it rained very hard after we arrived here. Had a good time nonetheless."
Wud be better if there are more choices for halal food. All the local food are non halal.we have to finish the trip and go out to eat.
"My kids, 4 and 2 came back with names of the birds they never knew before. This proves that they simply enjoyed themselves to the max despite being drenched in their own sweat."
"For Avian lovers, visiting Jurong Bird Park is a must when in Singapore. The Show at 4:00 p.m featuring owls, vultures and eagles/hawks was quite interesting. The birds are colorful and worth the visit. Highly recommended."
"Spent half a day at the bird park. Although I'd purchased tickets online (to avoid the queues), I still had to queue at a ticket window to get the actual ticket???! WTF? Once we got in, mu blood pressure went down as we sought out the many & varied bird species. Easy to spend longer there, esp with children in tow. Gift shop is expensive (of course)."
A fantastic day out for the family. The water park was great to cool us all down. The penguin enclosure was awesome.
This bird park is located end of city and it is good place to visit especially for bird lovers.We had great time there during our visit. You can feed different birds if you are aware about feeding times. We got a chance to feed parrots.Dont miss to take 'Tram' ride !
"Jurong Bird Park is reputed as the largest bird park in Asia, with more than 500 birds of around 400 species, covering a total land area of 20.2 hectares! You'll surely be amazed by the colors and beauty of the birds in the park ... birds of paradise, hawks, flamingos, parrots, emus, swans, penguins, and much much more!Aside from a wonderful display of birds, there are also regular shows in the park (like the High Fliers show, the Kings of the Skies, etc.). You also have a chance to feed some of the birds or have your photos taken with them. If you get hungry, just go to one of the eateries in the park (like Pizza Hut). Lastly, don't forget to visit the Waterfall Aviary (where you'll find a 30-meter high waterfall, said to be the highest man-made waterfall in the world).Jurong Bird Park is fun for both adults and kids. In fact, they have a dry and wet play zone area called the ""Birdz of Play"" for children. For souvenir, drop by the park's gift shop. To get a complete visit of the place, you may take the tram that moves around the entire site. The park is open daily from 8:30 AM to 6:00 PM. You may take a taxi to reach the place, or take the MRT, get off at the Boon Lay station (green line) and take a shuttle bus from there."
"Firstly I will tell you I am not keen on animal parks for personal reasons. However a day was to be had at the Jurong Bird Park as my significant other wanted to go there and also our child to see the birds as well whilst in Singapore for holidays.The first part of the day was very humid and we spent time walking to see the flamingos, followed by Pelican cove and swan lake We stopped at Waterfall Cafe and whilst I recovered from the steamy day in the cool of the cafe the more energetic went up the stairs to the viewing platform. They told me it was good.I believe we had lunch at Songbird Terrace where our friend and child left us after eating in the a/c little cafe. Not much seating here when very busy. Little shop located at the other end of the rectangular shaped area where cafe located had some good gifts but on the higher side of pricing, but at least I could see the staff were happy and obviously the money would go to the upkeep of the animals health etc. We purchased some stuffed toys to take home with us and give as gift for friend's child at school (she was thrilled with the bird we purchased incidentally). The toys seemed well made.By the time we got around near Window on Paradise, we decided to go back to the main entrance after that as we were near the end, however we made the choice to see the toucans and Hornbills located just to the side of the road/walkway. This proved a difficulty to get back as just before we could walk back to the main cover the skies opened up and it rained heavily. The cover we did find nearly met it's match in terms of water on the ground as the water from the rain was almost torrential! However what an experience to watch the rain come down like that and it was just us there, there was a lot of thunder and lightning but we were safe. After what seemed like a fairly long time we managed to get back to one of the tram stops with an umbrella we had in lighter rain.However we had been going the wrong way on the pathway and would need to go back around the track, virtually around the whole park. However before too long a staff member appeared in a golf cart style vehicle and asked us if we wanted to go back to the entry/exit?! He even apologised for the vehicle not being totally covered up. At this stage I didn't care but it was covered over our heads. In reality as long as it had four wheels and a steering wheel to get us back I didn't mind. I was exhausted from the day as we had walked in the heat which was our own choice as the attractions are fairly close and paved to each other. I asked how much was the lift back to the entry/exit and he said it was at no cost and the park realised that there is not much cover in rain weather. Joseph was the staff member's name and he was extremely polite and friendly to us. I wish to specially commend Joseph in his appearing at just the right moment and his super polite manner. In the end it made a difference to how we felt at the end of the day after being rather exhausted and our child wanting to go back to the hotel.The kind park staff who directed us around the water that had slightly flooded in the pathway to the entry/exit. They made sure we went the right way to get out and that we didn't get lost in my haze of tiredness.Once again the Singaporeans have been very kind and giving. They made us very welcome wherever we went like friends. Thank you Jurong Bird Park and staff.There is a few really good photo opportunities, one is near the Pelican Cove were there is an outdoor gazebo. However take mosquito repellant for around this area or you will get bitten. Especially for small children who may react to the bites."
Was a great experience. Only gripe was that the good restaurants are at the entrance so having a meal means coming all the way to the entrance
"Jurong Bird Park is a great place to visit early in the day, or later, when songs and activity are at their peak, for birds!"
We visited the park and spent half a day here. Its good if you are interested in birds and colours. The park is well maintained and very clean. All facilities are available
"Great park, designed for kids and families. Very good exhibits of birds of all sizes, types. Live shows and demonstrations together with a large free flying netted aviary .You can pay to have photos with smaller parakeets or holding some of the very colourful, larger macaws. Do this together with the Butterfly and Insect Park, the Sentosa Merlion and Fort Silo, on Sentosa. The fort is very interesting with its static displays and movies of past events, surrender of Singapore . This will fill in a full day for you and worth the effort."
We spent a morning here and it was great to see the different birds. Tram car is worth the extra $5 as gives a different perspective than just walking around.
The bird park is a great way to spend a part of your day in Singapore. There are so many great birds to see and the park offers several shows during the day as well. The park also offers a tram ride around the park with several stops so you can get off and explore as well.
"It's over 20 years since we first visited the Jurong Bird Park and we thought it would be good to go again. We had a very pleasant afternoon viewing the bird life, strolling around the undulating site, lots to see. If you have the time while you are in Singapore it's worth a visit."
"Had a very pleasant family outing to the Bird Park. Aside from the birds, the tropical lush vegetation alone is worth a visit. For me, the Lory Loft is the highlight, with its ""hands on"" experience with colorful birds literally feeding off your handsThere are a number of food outlets , so you definitely won't go hungryScale is small, so you could easily walk , instead of hopping on the tramFor rainy days, it would have been better if they had more covered walkways. It can get crowded with bus loads of tourists"
"visit all places in the park including amphitheatre, penguin feed, tram ride, bird show is worth a visit."
"Small and Beautiful park - we keep coming back again and again. We may need better connectivity to main MRTs at reasonable price for families to come together. Also, we need vegetarian food options as it is very far away."
"Unfortunately due to the nature of birds, most of the exhibits are in cages so it's not as immersive as the Singapore Zoo. However, it's still a nice place to walk around. The shows are quite good - the Birds of Prey especially. We went and my friend got on stage and had a vulture land on her!There is also a very nice hidden waterfall near the end of the park (connected to a cafe). You can walk up some stairs to get near the top and there are a variety of colorful birds walking around in that area.There's a bunch of penguins there. so cute."
The number of bird species here is amazing. Dont miss the raptor show which we really enjoyed. We missed the Hi Flyer show which we are told is very nice too. Great place to take your kids and learn about many bird species. As usual fantastically organized place.
"The bird park has lot of activities for kids like Lory feeding, feeding bread to flamingos. Also they have two bird shows which are very informative and exciting for kids."
The Bird park was a very enjoyable day. Ensure you go in time to see the shows and allow between 3-4 hrs. Food options were not very good at this park and it wasn't as good as the zoo but still enjoyable
"Everything is costly in here, as the case is with singapore. But a wonderful day can be spent here for nature lovers, though everything is caged, they are doing some great conservation work as well especially regarding hornbill conservation. Must see for families and kids."
"Love the bird park, we have been multiple times here. Love the Lorikeets, all the animals seem to be very well looked after, with plenty of food and access to clean water- we were very impressed by this. All staff seemed very knowledgeable and were always willing to answer any questions. The food courts were a bit hit and miss, having got to the indoor waterfall to find what was effectively a snack shop, was a shame, but it was too hot to traipse around looking for somewhere else. Would recommend the mini-train ride around the park too."
"This aviary is located on approximately 49 acres along the western slope of Jurong HIll. In one corner, you will find a collection of flightless birds (considered dinosaur descendants). You'll also find 5 species of penquins & discover the parrot show during lunch in front of flamingo lake."
"Jurong Bird Park is a lot of fun. I suggest going early to avoid the crowds, perhaps prebuy your tickets because the queues are outrageous.I recommend taking the tram to get an idea of the whole park first before splitting off to follow your nose.I visited Jurong Bird Park through RMG Tours- I do not recommend this. It takes too long in transit and I didn't get as much time at the park as I wanted. You should Spend a while there, there is a lot to see and do, the variety of birds is impressive and their enclosures seem elaborate and reasonably natural.Take your time here. If you just run through the park you'll be the usual suspects- pelicans, flamingoes, penguins. If you take your time, you'll see the smaller birds, the exotic birds, the amazing bird shows.A lot of the park seems to be a bit run down and out of date, undergoing maintenance and the like. It's still in working order and there's still a lot to see, but it's not a modern, seamless experience like the Night Safari."
"Great place with kids, they will love it , birds everywhere in all shapes and colors. A must visit in Singapore."
Its a paradise for all bird lovers. This place offers you to meet a huge variety of birds across all continents. Some tips for visiting this place- Book your tickets online to avoid queue- This place offers hip hop tram ride so include that in your ticket. The tram doesn't operate during heavy rains- You can also rent a battery operated bike at 35 SGD for a day- Ensure that you have taken the park map before you start so that you dont miss anything- Explore the park in a planned way as there are 2 bird shows in 2 different areas of the park. Both shows are worth viewing
Very colorful and beautiful birds. Wide range of species from all over the world.Do check the timings of the special shows and plan your time accordingly. One can spend here 4-6 hours but it could be tiring as well
The jurong park is lovely for people obsessed with different types of birds. It is a great place to visit by yourself of the children and show them the varieties of birds this place has to offer.
"I went to the park since morning with my family, we enjoyed the bird show very much and then we went for the water play and stayed their for almost 2 hrs, my daughter loved it and i was prepared for it this time as i brought for her swimsuit, we did not have time to go over the whole park as i was traveling with a baby and i had to cut it short."
This park is quite far. I heard that they are going to move this place beside the three zoos so you better visit this park before they shut it down.I'm fascinated with birds so I guess I liked it!The place is elevated so I think it's not good for oldies but they have a tram.it's better to take a tram to go to the stations.The aviaries are huge and the birds are well taken care!The vulture show is amazing! I really loved it!Some of the areas are not that maintained but the nature and habitat feel is still there.There are peacocks that just walking around the zoo! Next time I'll bring grains so I can feed them!There's a hanging bridge and waterfalls!All the staff are friendly
"I'm completely obsessed with birds and have a huge fascination with zoology so this is obviously biased, however, this place FELT like Jurassic Park at points and that just really appealed to the kid in me, and I'm sure it will in most people!"
Brought the kids to the bird park. This is probably my 4th or 5th visit but it is the first time going there as a parent. Tips:- bring not just a camera but a 360 camera if you have one- stroller for kids is a must as there will be lots of walking- go on a weekday- bring your own water or you will have to pay for expensive drinks in hot weather
"It's a place to go to if you have kids with you. Jurong Bird Park is one of the bests in the region - I think it is the largest in Asia. Not only that they have a great variety of birds but they also host some great shows. We watched both the High Flyers' show and the King of the Sky show - apparently we liked the first one better. I would suggest you check the show times from the website and plan your tour accordingly. The bird feeding experience was really nice as well along with the walk down the stairs.There is a kid's play area with lots of water activity. So go prepared accordingly. And in case you want to go easy on your foot, do buy the tickets for the trams. That way it is easy to see the whole park without getting your feet too tired."
"a wonderful place to visit. it is far from the MRT station you need to take a bus or a taxi to reach there. you will see a many different types of birds and you will get informations about them. if you like to walk in the park you need a comfortable shoes because it is a large park, btw you can take tram ride if you don't like to walk but you need to pay for it. the best part of the this park is feeding the parrots. i recommend to watch the shows of the parrots and the eagles."
The Jurong Bird Park has a wealth of information about birds. You can enjoy the falcon show as well as the Penguin Show. The tram ride takes you around the park main attractions. You can also grab a quick bite.
A great day to spend half a day . Very well presented and informative . Great for all the family . Must see .
Great collection of Birds -nice natural settings. It was especially nice to be able to feed some of the birds.
The bird park is rather old but has undergone upgrading. It Long history also means that there is a very capable team of Trainers and Presenters for the bird shows. I would recommend spending at least 5 hours between 10:30-3:30 at the park. This way you can catch both shows at 11am and 3pm. The shows features small birds as well as birds of prey. In between bring your kids to the water park and be thrilled and cool down in hot and humid Singapore. Admission to the water park is free. Take a tram ride and you must stop at the aviary and macaws enclosure. The tram ride gives visitors a clear idea of what the park has to offer and you can selectively choose what and where you wish to spend your time.
"To get to the bird park, take the MRT to Boon Lay then bus 194 which drops you outside.It's quite a large park with a large number of birds from all over the world, although primarily tropical zones.I enjoyed the flamingoes, macaws, birds of paradise and also the Andean condor. There is a breeding programme here for rare species as well as displays for younger visitors.It's more geared up for families with fast food outlets and play areas. I paid SIN$29 for admission plus an extra $5 for the tram which I did not use.However, the far side of the park is fairly hilly and anyone with mobility issues would be best using the tram."
+ Excellent place to view different birds;+ Feed Birds from a hanging bridge about 9 stories high+ Few good Shows- Only 2 hour attraction - far from the city
This is one of the best bird park in the world. Very well maintained place with good shows to entertain the children. Interesting place for birders.
"A surprisingly well organised Bird Park. If its not here , its probably not a bird. Its a much larger park than I anticipated. Its mostly outdoor not the 'stuffy caged up sad zoo type' places. The most impressive thing was the giant Toucan enclosure. The noise from these very powerful birds wings is truly prehistoric."
"Variety of tropical birds that will astound you. The patrot show is extremely entertaining and demonstrates the ability of parrots skills, intelligence and need to be active. A crowd pleaser and staff are respectful and accomodating."
"Nice way to spend half a day and see some interesting birds. Easy to get to. Good value if you get the multi park pass that includes the zoo , river adventure , and night safari."
"Kids like the show very much! And also can take photo with birds, the best is they know how a bird hatch from an egg!"
Thought this would be the same as any other bird park but it has its own beauty. Shows are a must see and the park is not so big but exquisite one
We visited here as our 6YO is Bird mad! We caught public transport but hadn't realised it was little far out of town so be prepared to rail then bus to get there if your doing the same. The Bird show was quite entertaining and the kids loved splashing in the water park.
"Juring Bird Park is a wonderful place to visit. Hundreds of bird species can be viewed here. There are some shows too, demonstrating the natural abilities of birds. You can have great photos taken (for a charge) with the park's famous large parrot collection or if you like, you can feed the birds ( with birdfood sold in the park). There are adequate signage everywhere and they help to identify the birds and learn some of their habits. Some birds could fly away if they would want to, but instead they hang around the parks ponds or roost in the gigantic trees. The vegetation is fabulous, real tropical rainforest-like, thus creating a jungle-feel. However, outside the park there is another jungle: the concret jungle of Singapore. If you visit the park, it may be a good idea to bring your own cut lunch or snacks and some drinks because the eating places there are perhaps a little expensive. There are endless photo opportunities of course, especially on a nice sunny day.You can reqach the park by public transport from Singapore or if you can afford it, take a taxi (appr. $20-25 Singapore one way). On the way back it may be a good idea to order a taxi to the exit by phone or ask the consierge to order one for you. There maybe a few people there, waiting for a cab, but if you order one, yours will arrive soon and you don't have to line up and wait."
"We visited the Jurong Bird park recently and were very impressed. They have an interesting array of birdlife, including some Australian emus and pelicans! Well laid out, and with different shows featured throughout the day, it was an enjoyable way to spend some time whilst in Singapore. There is a small train which ferries people around if you can't manage the walking."
"My first time here. Saw a lot of bird variety including the pink flamingo. I am most impressed about the bird of prey show, which showed the eagles and vultures. Saw the talent show of the different talking birds and bird flyer. Unfortunately, the weather was bad and could not take the tram. Place is small but good enough."
"A must place to visit in Singapore. Has battery operated cart to take you around. Has a wonderful bird show. Like other tourist attractions is wheelchair, pram , stroller friendly. Has water fountains for drinking spread across the whole area. We saw a Lion dance as well, as part of the Chine new year celebrations. You can feed fishes to penguin after paying 3 SGD. Has a small store for buying souvenirs. Children of all age enjoy, the various shows. Make sure you plan your trip accordingly, as it might take couple of hours there moving between various shows, and watching them. You would get dead tired as well, there are some eateries as well to snack on."
"It's nice Aviary with a huge collection of birds and also shows that involve birds. Its a good visit with children, especially while watching the shows."
This is a nice bird sanctuary where you can see different types of birds. There is 2 birds show that you must see. Take clothes with you if you have kids as there is a little water park inside.
"Took this tour with my 12yr old son.Pick up was on time, guide polite and gave necessary information (but nothing more). The bird park was amazing. Lori Loft a particular favourite, but not for those who dont like contact. The tight schedule of tour ment we didn't see half the park only a few exhibits at the beginning, high flyer show, lori loft and waterfall. I would describe the tour as more of an escort, as there wasn't a whole lot of information about the birds, park, area, being shared. Towards the end of our trip thunder began rumbling, (we were happy for a storm to cool things off) our guide appeared concerned he would get wet - we stated we were fine with a bit of rain, yet he hurried us along. Very much looking forward to returning one day but will just attend the park and not book 'tour'. Tour was prompt and well organised, it just didn't provide the experience we were after."
"Came back to the bird park yesterday with my daughter (7) and son (3) in tow. This time they were mainly interested in the lory feeding, and then talking to the parrots. But they also enjoyed quick visits to the other exhibits too. Fortunately the weather wasn't so hot and as a result it was easy enough to walk all the way around. The annual pass here is very good value, although this time we opted for the 4 park annual pass."
"The park is really park like with little zoo feeling. There are water courses & a small,lake & even a waterfall. The birds seem well cared for. Birds of prey show was unusual & informative not just entertaining. Parrots show was fun. There is a free tram that makes a circuit of the park if you get tired of walking. Metro from downtown & connection to bus to park is easy."
"Smaller than Singapore Zoo. Jurong Bird Park is an attraction one can consider when holidaying in Singapore. You wouldn't miss much not going, but if you have the time to, dropping by would be worth it too.There are a range of birds, most found in South East Asia, but the concept is rather similar to the Singapore Zoo.Trams are also available upon purchase with entry tickets, but it really isnt necessary to hop on a tram here. Its small enough to walk and you'd be missing out on seeing various bird species when on a tram.Mosquito repellent should be part of your to bring items. There are water coolers situated around the Park, so don't worry about being dehydrated. It can be a rather hot and humid walk, as it is outdoors with not much shelter along the walking path."
Highlights -lory loftHawk showN parrot showBut a ticket that includes unlimited tram rides .. some of the drivers were rude and not helpful ( we had wheelchair and a pram) but most of the staff wasThey don't have a feeding / nursing room only open diaper change area but on request they opened the guest/ prayer room multiple times and were very kind :)It did not seem like a whole day event as mentioned if planned well
"We enjoyed our visit, the park is beautifully done generally with plenty of public facilities (toilets and drink fountains).The labelling could have been more informative/clearer in many areas. It is on a hill so be prepared to walk UP at some point!The parrots etc. we felt could have been displayed better - maybe something similar to the waterfall aviary which was VERY good. particularly as the cage mesh is so thick it is hard to take photos.The High Flyers show was good and funny, also informative.We enjoyed ourselves."
This park has a very special place in most Singaporean hearts as we grew up with it. Still remember the school excursions here with our classmates. Now it is slated for relocation to Mandai and this present place will be demolished. Sad for many of us. We will miss the man made waterfall and the open aviary.
"We say worth a look because I have some spectacular exhibits but some exhibits that really need improvement in my opinion. The waterfall aviary absolutely fabulous the real light enclosure with a super large man-made waterfall and viewing points around both sides of the enclosure, when inside the nets are so high and the enclosure is so large you are not aware that you are inside and aviary.I hope sometime in the future some of the birds in small enclosures might be treated to a larger aviary like the waterfall.There is an inexpensive tram ride around the park with various points to hop on and hop off, I would suggest you take a full drive around to figure out which items you would like to see which ones you can manage to walk to."
This is a lovely relaxing place. And while you are there you can have a good time studying some of the most stunningly beautiful or interesting birds on the plant. I love the lorikeet enclosure. You can forget you are in a managed facility in there as the birds fly near by or play in the trees. Its a great place for kids especially if you are trying to get them to be interested in and respect nature. But there are plenty of elderly people in there too enjoying the birds. And the 'train' that ferries you around means the walking isn't onerous for the elderly.
TipsVisit at 9.30 in morning.There are two shows.. Hawk show and Bird show (11 am). Shows are really nice.Take tram ride at the end.It's very long walk. Kids May feel tired.
"No matter how much you plan and read the map before you go, you do get confused in these parks. My advice would be to make it for the two morning shows - 10.00 & 11.00 am.Do the tram ride post that. We ended up reaching at 10.30 and immediately followed the herd to stand in the tram line, which was long at that point. Ended up missing the 11 am show also and had to wait all the way till 3 pm for the High Flyers. Had no energy to wait to see the next show at 4 pm. So go early, catch the shows first, and then you are free to wander around. The park is not too big, and can easily be covered in a half day. I found the souvenirs here reasonably priced compared to other tourist attractions. One word of caution - if you feed the lories at Lory Loft, be sure your child is wearing sleeves. The bird are a little heavy and flock down on the person holding the nectar. My daughter got a big scratch on her shoulder. May be an interesting experience, but not my idea of fun. Also, don't miss the breeding & research centre to see for yourself how they help hatch and care for young birds. All in all, a pleasant experience."
Booked this trip while there and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Take a camera - you don't want to miss the shots you can get. The monorail is a bonus for foot sore/weary trippers. One not to miss.
Seeing the different types of birds is a great experience.Good shows and Penguin feeding session is really great!! Children will enjoy it thoroughly.
"There is a lot to see here, be prepared to walk. Else opt a tram ride to get a glimpse of the place.We witnessed High Flyers show and Kings of the skies. Both shows were hosted amazing and kept us looking for what's next.Be early and choose a good spot for a good view. Else choose a seat close to exit as it gets very crowded and will take time to exit.Do the tram ride in between the show timings else skip a show to beat the queue for tram ride."
Great place to take the children for a fun experience - the range of birds is amazing.Bit out of the main tourist area but well worth the journey to Jurong.
Fabulous assortment of birds to see . Great bird show. Only fault I would have is the food . We had a buffet - not a good selection and the food wasn't good . Overall had a great day
My Kid really enjoyed the Bird park and for the ambiance it had.. Situated outside the city and the transit is a main issue for this Park ..!
"My kid enjoyed it very much. Ability to feed them was amazing, so as the show in the amphitheater. Birds have relatively high freedom as they move freely. However, if they provide more space for birds of pray, this place would be perfect. Sad to see those giants in cages that won't allow them to move freely.The children water play area is amazing. My kid played there till they closed it down."
"We spent the morning half of the day we were to return to India, at Jurong Bird Park... Try to get to the park by 8:30 or so, we could see only the High Flyers' show and missed the other one. The high flyers' show, lasting for about 30 mins, was excellent, to say the least! The park has a vast collection of birds in their natural habitats. Do visit the aviary loft & parrot paradise... The park however requires quite a bit of walking and you may wish to rent a stroller for the entire day at SGD 9 for your kid. You can also explore the park by tram, though you would miss out on viewing more than half the collection if you choose the tram. There's a pizza hut too inside the park! Good place."
"Lovely place.Highlights of the place:Lory loft- where you can see free flying colourful parakeets very closely.Waterfall aviary: very beautiful man made highest waterfall and adapting birds including a peacock that welcomes you at the entrance..Suggestions:shows: for best view, occupy the central lower seats if possible.Clothing: very comfortable,, summer style clothing. Be prepared to be drenched in your dripping sweat.Overall, a worthy place to visit. 4-5 hrs should be sufficient to cover both the shows and the highlights of the park."
"If you are a tourist and short for time, this should be your 3rd choice among the parks, after the Zoo and Night Safari.A four-hour visit is quite enough to cover all the 'exhibits'.The Lory Loft is perhaps the family favourite. Purchase the feed and the experience you get is worth the ticket price. There's a waterplay area for young ones. So bring a change of clothes if you are visiting with kids who can't resist getting wet.Would we go again? Maybe in 5yrs time."
"Have a very good collection of birds but are caged birds only. People like birders, who want to see the birds in the natural environment like forests and wetlands will be a little disappointed."
"Great place, well kept and friendly staff! Will definitely be back once we get the chance. Will also reccomend to friends."
"Good shows in King of skies and high flyers. Must visit the waterfall aviary. Team will be very crowded. Take a walk, it's not a huge place after all. Can cover leisurely in 3 hrs. Nicely maintained birds"
"You may opt to go to the park just or near lunch time, so that you can cover all the birds with shows."
"Paradise for nature and bird-lovers. Super exciting experience for children is specific. Make sure you attend a scheduled show as they are truly spectacular. Worth the effort to get there and experience the birds. Personally love flamingos, ever since I've visited the park. It's a fun afternoon/day activity."
"Its a good half day trip. Give it a full day if you polan to walk all the exhibits. there is a wet park for kids, so do take pool wear, change of clothes and towel as appropriate...do not miss the parrot show at 11 am and 3 pm."
We took a taxi from our hotel as we didn't want to do this on a tour. It took about 1/2 hour to get to the bird park and we paid to go on the tram it is well worth the $5.00 as you get to go around the park and see what there is them you can walk to the different areas. The waterfall area is lovely as is the rest of the bird park and the entertainment is well worth seeing. This is good for children. We had a lot of school groups the day we were there. You can get on and off the tram and do different areas.
"Getting there and back: take bus #194 from Boon Lay Bus Interchange berth B8, and you alight outside the park. Coming back, you can take the bus from the same bus stop as it is a loop service.Tips:1) Go EARLY (i.e. be there at 8.30 am) to view the birds in relative peace and quiet. It gets packed by afternoon2) If you intend to feed the lories at Lory Loft, the park sells a small cup of nectar water ($3 each - prepare exact change) which will attract them. However, go in the MORNING as the birds will be too full by afternoon, and will ignore you3) F&B is available but overpriced. You can stock up necessities at Jurong Point, the shopping centre next to Boon Lay MRT4) Wear comfortable shoes as the park is on hilly terrain. Also bring mosquito repellent. Most of the park is in the open with no shade5) The majority of the birds are caged up, and you won't be able to take clear photos. Manually focusing with a long telephoto lens will help blur cage lines"
"In order to see all the beautiful exotic bird, you need to walk the park. Do not take the trolley as you will not see much. Most of the tourists are taking the trolley so they do not walk the 1.5 km. You must walk it. Outside of the main entrance which is commercial, the rest of the park is calm. I recommend you see part of the bird show but leave before the end to start the walk before the tourists."
"Arrive at the time of gates opening and spend atleast till 3-4 pm. Keep the leaflet or the map of the park while entering the park. Note down the show/event timings and accordingly arrive at the place 10-15 mins early. Sit right in the middle of the stage. Best for kids aged 8 and above. Lot of walking is required. Do not bother to try the tram, you cannot see the park in detail."
Went to Bird park couple of days ago with parents . It was a cloudy day . Still went ahead . Reached by 8.30 that's when they open . Not much crowd when we entered . There are two shows @ 10 and 11 .By the 10 am show crowds started coming in . We did the tram ride as we entered . So not much crowd . Post the shows noticed that tram queues were big as well . Both the shows were good . 11am one was the best . We were lucky that the rain gods were away during the show time .After the shows took a walk around and exited by 12.30-1 pm.Must visit if u have enough time in singapore
"Took a train to Boon Lay station (has a shopping centre there so you can stop and get snacks/lunch etc) then caught the local 194 bus to Jurong Bird Park - takes 10 mins and costs S$3.20 return. Cheap as chips.Get there as early as possible - it gets real hot in Singapore and the crowds at the bird park build up as time goes on. When you've had enough and want to come back, just wait at that same bus stop as the bus does a little u-turn and takes you back to the station. Simple!Entry to the Park is rather pricey at S$29 each, but one doesn't mind if the birds are loved and looked after. Personally I found some of the cages rather small for the larger birds but they all seemed very well cared for.One of the major frustrations for me was the width of the wire on the cages. Most were too close together to get decent photos of the birds (I draw and paint them later so decent photos are important).There's a very staged bird show which those who aren't around birds much may enjoy. I didn't mind it but my partner wasn't too thrilled.Best part was coming across a pond where a staff member was feeding night herons and a rather shy jabiru. They could all fly off if they chose so I had uninhibited access to photograph the birdlife in its natural environment. Happiness plus.Loved the lizards, squirrels, hornbills - well, pretty much everything really. Staff all seemed very pleasant although we didn't have a lot to do with them.HINT - Wouldn't go on a weekend if you can help it - the crowds would be truly nasty."
"We were lucky to be there on a cloudy day, thanks to the tropical climate. Good bird shows specially the one with vultures is classic."
"The main issue we have with this attraction is the sun. Might be a plus point for some tourists out there but not for me. You can check the bird show schedules, take part in feeding activities (payable) or simply enjoy the park at your own pace. Bring umbrellas as they are good for both the sun and potential rain."
Very good experience for the kids. We all enjoyed the shows and they had some interactive stations which my kids enjoyed. There is a breeding and research station where my son was able to watch with wonder a tiny just hatched tiny baby bird being feed with a tiny syringe.
Jurong bird park is unlike any zoo - here birds are free and looks really happy in enjoying the natural surroundings and so do the visitors. Zoo is generally a depressing place but jurong bird part and bird show are a must visit for anyone visiting Singapore.
Jurong Bird park has good collection of Birds. There are 2 shows in the park which are a must see. Kings of the sky and High Flyers show. Had a great time with family and kids.
"Compare to other attractions, this park is ok. Park ticket and Inside battery car ticket are separate. Don't miss two bird shows."
"Overall a good trip, one can take the tram to go around.One can pre-book through klook which was bit cheaper than over the counter.The park is well maintained, you have to be early at 8.30 as the park closes at 5.30."
It was a great day out for us with two small kids. They have bird shows also. First take the tram ride to get some idea about the park. Collect a map at the gate which will have information about the park as well as different shows. They have a children play area as well. Carry swimming costume for your kids if they like to play with water.
"The Jurong Bird park is a well maintained bird park, you've to be there early in the morning it opens i presume at 8:30, closes at 5:30, we took a photograph with thee birds, as a momento, birds most of them are kept in the open, don't touch them i would say, our tickets included a tram ride, we first went on tram witnessed the flamingos , later took a walk , it was a good experience."
"I was a little disappointed, the Lorikeet area closed for some repair work, all the birds didn't look too happy in general. Not as interesting as I thought it will be, they need to spice it up a little."
"If you visit SG, you must visit JBP. It is a must visit. The variety of birds is mind numbing. Don't miss the bird shows."
"I was here 30 years ago, and my memories were of a low commercial group of aviaries where one could view different species of birds. It's now very commercialized, with rides and shows. The most annoying part -- a sponsorship by the Smurf movie series, which leads to thousands of plastic Smurfs being placed among the exhibits. We saw more Smurfs than birds, and it was too distracting.The best experience was the Penguin feeding -- not many people so we were able to interact with the trainer (and the penguins)"
Very wonderful experience to visit this park. My kid enjoyed a lot. The bird show was interesting & we enjoyed the trum ride also. This park is accessible by MRT-bus from town; however it's convenient & time worthy to use taxi. There is a Pizza Hut inside the park.
"Visited the Jurong Bird Park on a public holiday in Singapore. Very very crowded but only at the entrance, once we entered the park is big enough to accommodate everyone except for the tram rides. There were long queues for the tram ride around the park but the wait was not long.Many many different types and varieties of birds. Kept the kids entertained. Colourful birds too. Lory loft was temporarily closed when we visited so didn't get to enter to feed the birds or walk on the bridge there.Kids spent the last part of the day at the Kidszone wet playground. Area had a dry and wet playground. Kids absolutely love the wet playground which has a huge bucket of water which would periodically pour down on them. The playground also has some youth employed by the park to play or look out for the kids.Missed the bird shows as it was heavily raining in the afternoon. Few restaurants in the park and a kiosk operated by Pizza Hut. It's called Pizza Hut Express so they may not have a full menu. Can't say more since I didn't patronise the kiosk.Overall, it was a very enjoyable trip and kids with iOS be very happy there."
The Bird Park is beautiful and well managed. Lot of shows and experiences are held for the entertainment of the guests and every one of them is worth attending. The birds are beautiful. The walk between the polys which are a part of the experience is lovely. A Must visit when in Singapore.
"Made our own way to Bird Park via MRT and bus from Clarke Quay cheapest way and easy. Everything is well written to understand and trains are so frequent longest wait was 3 minutes coming from Sydney where we're used to 15min +.Bird Show was fantastic. Got up close to a Toucan. Beautiful waterfall near the end of the park, lovely photo opportunities.Extremely hot day, water stations were great. Bought a fan with water which made kids happy.Lots of different birds from around the world.Great day. Took approx 2 1/2 hours.Had Pizza Hut for lunch."
its was an unforgetful experience with the birds around and the sound of them keep me peace and relax
Excellent self arranged trip. Easy taxi ride from the hotel.Get on/off tram ride around the park for the less energetic. Easy walking everywhere. Great for kids. A very good live bird show in the amphitheatre.Well worth the trip. Sometime this year it is being relocated to the Zoo.
"Years ago during our first visit, it was boring... And we never stepped in again till 5years later today.While looking for Easter Fun activities with kids, I spotted smuff Easter egg hunt happening at JBP.We reached at around 11am, but car park is full(public holiday), we ended up having our lunch elsewhere and returning at 1pm. By then we are able to enter carpark.We spent most of our time in queue, waiting and waiting. There's a big crowd for purchasing their entrance & tram tickets. We thought that's the only 1 that we have to wait. But no, we had to wait for tram(Long queue). And finally we hopped in to tram and its start to rain. We couldn't get off at any stations( our mistakes- no umbrella, no raincoat), this is a must! We return to main station and get our day pass converted to annual pass (promo pay $29 a day can convert to a year). And is such a mess system, we are required to queue again. After done rain stopped, and we queue again for tram! We reach smuff waterfall aviary station at 3:45pm. Reaching the activities station at 3:50pm, and being informed ""sorry that we are closed for the day"". Such a disappointment that they closed at 4pm and it's only happening for 3days. Waterfall aviary is beautiful, we enjoy our walk and scenery there. So far we visited penguin, parrot and we stranded at pelican cove( raining again). We have yet to watch any shows. However, this park is beautiful, although our visit is a waste... By queues, rains... Their nature is fascinating, we will make use their annual pass to visit again! And next time, will be visiting with their free teaching resources for my preschoolers."
"Jurong Bird Park is definitely a must see for kids when in Singapore. It isn't a massive park and can be done in a leisurely manner.Kids would get to see different species of birds not to mention the 2 main shows that are repeated in the morning/ evening.10am show is a bit too early and can be shifted to 10:30 with subsequent one moved to 11:30.Do note that you should bring swimmers, towel and change of clothes for the kids as there is a nice water play area which all kids enjoy to the hilt."
"Even though Bird park quite far away from the city center, it is worth a visit. Plan to reach early so that you can catch all the shows during the first half of the day and can easily finish seeing the park by 2-3 PM.We traveled by the MRT and then took a bus from the Boon lay bus interchange, Bus No. 194 drops you right outside the birdpark.Lory Loft where one can feed the birds was a different experience. The birds are very friendly & if lucky you can have one perched on your hand or shoulder."
"It is birthday trip for my 5 years old nephew. He enjoyed see the birds shows and different species of the birds. Unfortunately at the children play, which is the pool that we forgotten to bring his swimming trunk that he cant play with water. He is upset with it. For parents or aunties/uncles that wan the kids to have a memorable time in the zoos, remember their swim suits"
"really enjoyed this park. wonderful birds to see especially unusual breeds worth seeing, but maybe not in captivity, however they were well taken care of"
"We were a little disappointed with the bird park, it felt old and tired. This could possibly due the fact that there are rumours that it is moving out near the zoo. It is quite a long way out, we ended up catching a taxi as the MRT was quite a distance away. We visited in February, just before Covid-19 closed everything down, so tourist numbers were low. We didn't have to wait for anything, numbers were very low. The bird show was great. Hopefully it gets some new life it does move."
The only one birdpark in singapore. Many birds but can't full enjoy because too crowded of end year time
Have been here many times but this time I thought it looked sad and in need of an upgrade. Not having the monorail and the lake is a shame. No where nice to sit and get a coffee.Parrots looked unhappy.
It was disappointing because many parts of the park were under renovation and upgrading so we couldn't truly enjoy the different species of birds.
"We had a nice day. I had heard that the park was amazing. It didn't quite live up to expectations, but it was lovely. There were some very interesting species on display. The grounds provided a good opportunity to see some local wild birds too. Take your own food - food available at the park was very expensive and not that great."
"The park looked tired for Singapore standards and we later learned that it is moving next to Singapore zoo. The birds are well cared for and the variety is astounding. We (2 kids 9 & 6) enjoyed 2-3 hrs of wandering around learning and admiring the different species of birds. Tram available at extra cost, water area for kids to play and excellent birthing centre to view hatching sand birds being weaned. I'm sure once at the new facilities it will be even more impressive."
"Expecting to see an amazing array of birds while walking through the aviary's, I was disappointed to find they were very hard to see. A great environment for the birds but not so good to look at them. The best view of tropical birds was in the show where they had birds flying between handlers - as in the photo, but you did not see these while walking through. A better walk through aviary is at Peel Zoo in Western Australia."
"One of the best aspects of a visit to this park is the taxi trip out there where you get to see a part of Singapore you probably wouldn't see otherwise. We visited on a family day which was a big mistake. It was crowded and all facilities were tested to the hilt. We had to queue to see exhibits. We were expecting the birds to be in bigger enclosures. There is nothing sadder than to see a South American condor in a cage that it cannot 'soar' in. There is plenty of signage to inform you as to how well the birds are kept, but you somehow sense that they could be kept better."
"This is a very famous attraction, but I came away mildly disappointed.Access is easy: metro to Boon Lay and a 194 bus from the adjacent interchange, to a stop outside the entry gate.The setting is in dense tropical vegetation: in many ways more interesting than the birds.The birds are organised into about 30 different zones. There are lots of food outlets and toilets and kiddie attractions, but not many seats for those who are toiling in tropical heat on the sloping tracks and steps to view every cage.It is expensive, and the many varied extra features add even more cost.I was doing a basic clockwise walking tour, hoping to obtain more photos than can be achieved by riding the tram. A lot of the birds (mainly the larger ones) weren't visible, let alone photographable. The attraction was busy, with people of all age groups. Half were taking selfies, and most of the rest were photographing the information panels as a substitute for not seeing the birds. I opened with a highlight: the penguin display. Pelicans and flamingos seemed to be too prolific. I finished the circuit with the main highlight: the breeding/research centre, which had many excellent interpretive panels.Overall, it would be easy to fill a whole day if taking in some of the extra features, or just over 3 h if trying to photograph every cage. I completed my circuit in under 3 hours, as I was using it during a transit connection (I pick off something different each time I am connecting in Singapore)."
"The bird park is nice but shows signs of aging. It's difficult to see the birds through the old-fashioned cages and difficult to take their pictures. Also, the park is on a hill so it's really hard in the heat to walk up and down constantly to see the birds. The little train that takes people around stops too far from the trees we want to see. All in all, I'm happy it'll be moved closer to the zoo, it makes much more sense."
"Very far off from the city, Not a big variety of birds found. Not at all value for money. Can be avoided."
"Good place to visit, best attraction is the shows and covered bird park. It was very hot, so we did struggle to walk around. We enjoyed the shows and the area of the park which was enclosed."
Bird park is nice..maintained but it is very far from all main attractions. It takes your half day if you travel by public transport. Also there are no other attraction near by. Not many restaurants either. Birds are very beautiful and looks amazing in photos. but it depends on how much time you have in Singapore. If you are on tight budget and days then one can skip this.
It used to be one of my favorite places but I was disappointed this time. I did hear that they are moving the park to another location. There were very few birds in Lori Loft. Kids will love the shows.
"I was surprise that the bird park wasn't as big as the zoo. If not for the Gutetama egghunt event, I would feel that the bird park didn't have much things to see and do."
Visited Jurong on our recent trip to Singapore. We were told on the way there that the park was moving to a site next to the Singapore Zoo in the next year. We felt that many of the birds were housed in enclosures that were difficult to see through. The Parrot exhibition was fabulous and modern but other enclosures were older style.Staff were friendly and helpful and the birds we could see were great. Look forward to seeing their new home.
"The fun was marred by the fact that if only I had applied for membership at the entrance, I could have 10% discount on all food and drinks in the park."
"It had been awhile since we visited the bird park, we were disappointed at the Easter event, we reached the park at 11:20am and found our that the event supposed to start at 10am already out of colouring paper for the kids. We saw many disappointed faces from the little kids, we saw the event organiser argued with the parents when they asked for more details.We heard that the park will be moving soon, maybe that's why the up keep of the park is poor, the ponds look dirty and many cages are empty. It is not a place that we would like to visit again."
"Birds were created to fly, wings were created for this purpose. Seeing then in cage gave a sense of sadness in our hearts. Just to get public and spectators for the profit of building a park, these birds' freedom was sacrificed."
Came here for a day this week. Generally a pleasant although 'old school' experience especially the high flying bird show and especially the parrot that could sing in three languages. Impressive stuff. The Loris loft was also very good with good flying space for the birds.On the disappointing side was the 'Parrot Paradise' which looked more like hell for the poor birds clinging to the outside of their too-small cages and having their claws hit with plastic water bottles by ignorant stupid children unrestrained by their even worse parents. Grrrrrrr.Also the catering at Curry Gardenn was completely chaotic. Overwhelmed by the number of customers they simply gave up taking orders. We gave up and ate outside the park.
"My artist friends and I went on an event coupon I had for the park. We stayed the entire day, and interacted with the staff when they noticed the sketches we drew, as well as after watching the Kings Of The Skies performance. The staff were very personable, sharing each bird's name and their unique antics, and enriched our experience. The Lory Loft was our favorite exhibit where one could walk with a cup of nectar for lories to feed from, right on your hand. Just beware of their droppings.The staff made up for the worn down architecture and finishings of the location. The bird's cages were necessary but also felt restrictive after visiting the open habitats of the Zoo and Night Safari. The Bird Discovery Centre's aircon was also shut off and made the area very stuffy. The revamp for the Bird Park can't come soon enough."
"Easy to get to using the train and bus. Entry was $35; bring your boarding pass or passport for a 10% discount or even try to remember your flight number (I couldn't ). A huge area to cover by foot, it is also rather hilly and tiresome on a hot day. We decided to purchase a $5 ticket for the hop on/off tram. It has about 5 designated stops and passes many important exhibits, that if you wish to see, you would have to walk back to. We didn't as it meant too much walking up and down hills. Alot of birds were not visible in their cages, but the flamingos were a sight to behold."
"we were three me,my wife and my daughter.Jurong Bird Park in Singapore is the world's largest bird park. This is the one of main tourist attraction in singapore . there are many kind of birds. The harest thing is the weather .I felt like I hold iron on my back when I move from place to other. This place is beatiful for families with you children."
"I felt a little conflicted coming here because I hate the thought of birds in cages but I have never before seen a park dedicated to purely to such an array of birds.Get there early, definitely by taxi (approx $25 rush hour time from Clarke Quay way) and enjoy having the park to yourself for a while. The highlights were by far the shoebills and the wide variety of hornbills. They do need bigger enclosures as do the birds of prey. The walk in aviaries were an wonderful experience, especially birds of asia and the waterfall aviary - these do seem the right size for the birds they have flying around. The penguins however looked very desolate and is much need of an expansion and upkeep.I went to the high flyers show, I really didn't like the ending which I know should be the highlight but there had so many birds on stage thought it probably was a stressful experience for birds involved. Keepers however handled them well and were enthusiastic in explaining about protecting birds' environments.I spent abut 4 hours here as I loved viewing each type of bird, you never get this opportunity to see the size of some of them or hear what they sound like flying around and talking. However I couldn't help thinking that the quality of life for some of the birds particularly was really poor given their enclosure size. They probably could do with more information signs to go with their endangered level and how the park is supporting their conservation and expanding some of the enclosure sizes.The same could probably be said of alot of zoos and likely comes with the nature of attraction trying to balance out quality vs public being able to see them"
"I am a visitor of Singapore for the past 15 years and normally visit the locations more than once.The bird park during my first visit 2003 was fantastic and it was great fun, lots of variety very well taken care of. This time I had the feeling the park is not well maintained and could use some extra care. The variety was less and the place generally felt old.Still there are a few excellent shows but not up to the standard of my previous visits this is my 4th one.Again timing of the visit will make a lot of difference.Best way to get here is the taxi the SMRT arrives to a near by area and then you can take the bus but the journey is way too long....."
the park itself was nice. a lot of birds definitely worth seeing but some of them were caged which is reasonable however the fence don't have to be so dark and cramped you can't even see the birds inside! what's horrible are the restaurants there. no halal certified restaurants for muslims unlike singapore zoo. they did claim that some of them have no park no lard but the food was terrible. why can't they have nice and decent quality food like singapore zoo provides? definitely need to improve on that if they want to attract tourists & have returning customers or else it would be a one time visit and never again.
TIcket was very expensive that too during public holidays. Shall be less price atleast for locals. Can improve.
First the positive:Under the nets the enclosures in which the birds could fly freely were very beautiful.The negative:In the cages to keep the birds in which they can not or hardly fly is animal cruelty and not beautiful. Here would be less = more. That means about 1/3 fewer birds show that they make cages 3 times bigger
"Our experience was good. What stood out was the lush greenery, clean maintenance, courteous staff and the bird shows.We (me and my wife) were a little sad about keeping the birds in captivity.We generally feel this, wherever animals or birds, generally any species are kept in captivity.We wish this would stop, the world over.We wish all places, including the Jurong park, where animals are kept in captivity, would close down.We know this is asking too much.We know you are there in it for money and not for kindness to animals. But since you asked our views, we gave it."
Not that big but do have quite a lot of varieties of bird. Little bit stink due to the bird drops. So far flamingo is the best.
"It started pretty well, some eateries before entering the park. Penguin enclosure was quite impressive. We missed the penguin feeding time. Followed by a tram ride as the walk was quite up slope n pretty hot weather. Along the way there were some enclosures but viewing is limited,recommend on foot. 1st stop lory loft Station. Open enclosure with free flying lorries. U can buy lorries nectar n feed them up close n get nice photos. In house photographers available on site. Pretty expensive though..we moved on couldn't get to see hornbills n some empty enclosures. Along the way eagles n vultures followed by emus n some tall birds enclosures. We missed the bird shows.. There's free children wet play area along the way. Pelicans n flamingoes free area for nice photographs. Hawk shows available late afternoon."
I was disappointed that the pictures show bird feeding with large birds. but the ones we were allowed to feed were only the smaller parrots. so while i enjoyed the experience i was still disappointed.
Security staff is very poor in managing pram with babies inside. Insisted to park the pram when baby is still asleep when watching the bird show at the eagle vulture side.
The birds welcome you with a lot of noise. You are in their world. The place needs a good refurbishing. The trams are old. The bird show though one of its kind is old. The birds dont always follow instructions. The waterfall station is good. People dont alight once they board the train so getting a empty seat is difficult. Place can have more washrooms.
"We visited Jurong Bird Park in 1988 for the first time and returned a couple of years later. We enjoyed it a lot.Therefore and because many years have gone by since then, we decided to visit again.Getting there by public transportation is not as simple as described on the website. It's quite far away.The one show with the toucans we attended was rather stupid and seemed more aimed at children than at adults.Most birds' cages are not well kept. Too much foliage and thick wire makes it hard to see some of the birds.We did like the aviary with the pigeons and the one with the loris.But we would not return."
"It was pretty busy, packed with lots of tourists so the queues for the trolley ride were extensive and after 15 mins waiting I decided to go off on foot. It is quite a long way to wall to see all of the exhibits. I don't know what I expected, but most of the birds were in cages which is a disappointment and somewhat sad to see such beautiful creatures locked away like that. Some of the Parrots at Parrot Paradise looked as if they were stressed, showing repetitive behavior that caged animals so often do after prolonged captivity. I actually found it upsetting. The Waterfall Aviary was however good, with free flying birds in a big enclosure and the birdsong was a wonderful experience (not that you could actually see the singing birds all of the time). In all it is a place that can thrill and disappoint at the same time. If you want to see free birds in Singapore, go to Changi Village and Park - its free and I have seen Sea Eagles swoop down and take fish, Herons, Hornbills, Parrots and many more species just by sitting at the water front."
"I visited Bird park with my two kids in December 2018. I found it more of hype, my kids and I didn't enjoyed it very much and found not worth for the money paid. Train/tram stops at 4 stations only and hence it's totally waste of money. One need to walk a lot despite taking tram ticket. All birad show which showcases performance of parrots, maccao etc was very good. However Vulture show was not upto expectation. Only attractions where kids enjoyed were Penguin feeding and Pelican feeding. They should have kept more shows or interaction with birds to make it worthwhile. Ideally one should do Singapore Zoo and skip Bird Park."
"I first visited Jurong Bird Park in 1988, 30 years ago, and I was blown away by its beauty and variety. Now it looked kind of run down with too many old fashioned exhibits of birds in heavy wire cages. I learned that this is probably the last year it will be open in its present location as a NEW Jurong Bird Park is being built in the same area as the Singapore Zoo I have a feeling that the new one will be the best bird park in the World when it's finished. It really makes me want to come back to Singapore."
"You are welcomed by the loud screeching of parrots. The tram ride round the park sets the tone. Disciplined.The various stops each with its unique feature & bird's is nice. Waterfall station was good.The flamingos, vultures, owls are amazing.The show at Amphitheatre is unique.The souvenir shop is a loot though.Quite relaxing. Morning well spent.The place needs to spruce up."
This was an ok experience with nothing extra ordinary.... One must visit to check mark on the bucket list else can be skipped as well. The train is a saving grace to ply you up and down. For people who love to watch at birds and enjoy walking trails can visit this place
Some good attractions like bird flying show and up close with colorful birds (parrots etc) inside the fenced cage where they fly free while we walk in. Most of birds are in the cages we see them they the glass window or fence which is not very attractive.
We went on an afternoon trip and it was not really long enough we should have taken longer but it was interesting all the same . We did think it was amusing that they cancelled the penquin feeding because it was raining ha ha.
Great place for children to be introduced to exotic birds but disappointing to someone who prefers birds in their natural setting even if somewhat confined. Birds performed tricks and most were in cages. Some fairly large cages but still unable to fly. Needs serious updating to meet new standards for avaries where birds have a lot of freedom and people are confined! Great 'collection' of birds but saw no evidence of protecting from extinction or special breeding programs. More of a zoo than a reserve/preserve.
Shld have mc on e tram.prefer to be JBP staff who well verse bout the birds wen we pass-by while on e tram......
This is my third visit to the park and my son's first. The place gives that wonderful experience of being with the birds while feeling that they are not constrained in a cage. The budding bird watcher in my son enjoyed the park.A bit of eye soar was the staff attitude. There was not enough warmth with the staff. Even though I had the park hopper plus ticket which entitled me for tram service. The staff front ending the tram service was more interested in chatting with her colleagues than to check my ticket. She bluntly refused that we are required to buy a separate ticket and continued chatting.
"I took a park hopper ticket and am thankful I opt for it because none of the park now is worth visiting with the kind of money that is being charged. Good for the first time visitors but same story as night Safari park, zoo and river safari, park has not upgraded since last 10 years and only saving grace were the shows actually repeated shows with same themes, if it rains you are screwed and shows gets cancelled (here cannot blame the park) but there is no alternative they have in place as all the employees volunteers disappear and tourist are left on their own and this same experience over the years, was at least happy to see birds. quality of restaurants were bad. If you have visited earlier please utilize your children's vacation, time and your money better."
"The park is quiet outside the city so travel will take time. Tickets can be bought as a combo of zoo+river safari+night safari+bird park. The park is pretty, has variety of birds, clean and we'll maintained. There is a huge clan of penguins once you enter. There are two shows where birds are trained and is pretty amazing. There is a singing and talking parrot as well. Also, the park is situated on kind of a hill which makes it difficult to walk. So if you have elderly or kids along, be sure to take the tram. Other than the shows, the park is usual. If you are travelling by MRT, you will have to take bus 138 from the station which will take another 40-45 minutes."
Lots of birds and quite smelly. The penguin enclosure was depressing. The other sections were ok to visit but nothing great really. Expected a lot more than one bird in some cages.
Good shows/performance. Good range of birds in the park.Need to improve1. Penguin feeding didn't take place at 10:30am. Disappointed.2. Queue for tram at Station 1 too crowded.
"Only good thing about this place is the show. This place is good for the bird and animal lovers. For rest of the people, they can keep it towards the end of their itinerary."
"The birds were inside large cage where even people can go in. One of them even had a waterfall inside. They seemed quite happy and unafraid of human.An interesting for Bird lovers, but for normal people, might not be much.Overall, I won't be going there again and will tell my friends to go only if they have nothing else to do. It's not a **must go** place."
The waterfall Avery is absolutely amazing. If you do one thing then do this. It's very hilly so I would recommend getting the tram up to the top. The keepers were knowledgeable and pelican feeeding was great. However the bird of pray show was disappointing as it was mainly vultures.
"Was good overall but we couldn't see one of the shows due to the rain, I was hoping for a free pass but nope!"
"Kind of hard to reach: first you have to take the MRT all the way to the Boon Lay station, then find bus 194 by following the signs inside the shopping centre.Admission is very expensive (S$30). Paying an extra S$5 for the tram inside the park is recommended - although the area is not very big, it is extremely hot and humid, getting very tiring after a while.Highlights: high man-made waterfall and penguins."
"There are variety kinds of colorful birds. But most of them are put in small cages. The space are too small that they couldn't fly. Especially the penguins cage, it's too small for that number of them, not enough space for them to swim enjoyingly. I don't favor the bird show either. The birds couldn't complete their performance. One of the parrots didn't speak and one bird didn't fishish the flying performance through the circles. The host said that 'cause they were old. They were too old then why were the forced to work??? I don't support this kind of entertainment.I visited Jurong Bird Park because it's included in the tour package. I don't think I will visit again."
"Go for the two shows and feed the penguins. Take the tram to listen to the facts about the birds. Apart from this, let's just say I hope that when the park will be opened in the new location everything will be much better."
"Thought we would pay to have lunch with the parrots. Instead they shuffle you inside to a buffet restaurant & then tell you that you can take a drink or dessert out to the terrace where they do a small bird show. Really not worth the money to do. The advertising picture shows a lovely white table cloth with food & parrots right next to the visitors. It's nothing like this at all.Some of the areas of the park are great, mainly the huge netted walk through areas. Others are are very boring with many cages and dark shaded & overgrown areas. You will only interact with birds in the area where they have the lorikeets or in the main bird show.I visited Kaunda Birdworld in Australia and was sort of expecting something better but was disappointed. There are however an enormous amount of birds but I don't like looking at them in the smaller cages.Also in one of their displays they have a picture of a wallaby & joey but have labelled it as a kangaroo which is incorrect.Hope breakfast with the orangutans are better at the zoo and we haven't wasted our money."
"We were really excited to visit Jurong Bird Park after almost 6 years from our last visit.Sad to say that it raining in the morning and it was drizzling almost the rest of the day. Since we have young children with us, we just had a quick visit in the Lory loft and watched the shows in the afternoon (lucky that the amphitheater is covered!). We didn't get to really enjoy the rest of the park."
"It was a lovely park on itself, however, the cages are small and the vegetation too dense to see some of the birds! I will recommend this visit only if you have spare time in Singapore, if not, you will find the Zoo, the river safari and the aquariulm much more impressive..."
Brought my little one there today but she didn't enjoy it as much as the zoo trip. I guess she is too slow to follow the birds.
"I visited there a couple of times. I am not sure whether it is just my feeling or it is real, but I do not see as many birds as I saw when I visited there first time. For example, the 'Lori Loft' - The big cage where we can feed the birds with $3 bird feed, I remember, before as soon as I brought the bird feed, countless birds were approaching me and sit on my arms, shoulders, or head. But now.. really few birds were just stayed on the tree and did not even take a look at the bird feed.."
"This zoo is old and located in a small patch of forest. The trees are all majestic! Birds looks fine but some look tired. The route are hilly and I do feel breahtless as i have to push a pram =)Good news are they are moving to new location to be together with Singapore Zoo and the rest of the gang in 2020, wait for it!"
The place is nice for hangout especially with kids. Easy to go and have various type of birds species.
We were looking forward to going to the bird park however we feel very disappointed in what we saw. It is a big let down after going to the zoo & river safari. We felt some of the birds were in quite confined spaces - the ones that we could see !We wouldn't go back again
"Quite disappointing as you can hardly see the birds because of the cages, except where you can walk in and observe the various species of birds. The Lori park is very interesting as you can feed the loris with nectar that you purchase for 3 dollars. The Parrot paradise is good as well and shows are interesting. The hatching centre is very good."
Must attend various shows and live feeding sessions. Otherwise there is not much unless you are a die hard bird fanDon't miss following shows:10:00 AM: Kings of the Skies at Hawk Arena10:30 AM: Penguin Encounter at Penguin Coast11:00 AM: High Flyers Show at Pools Amphitheatre
Few places still can be improve. But the customer services to all the staff there are excellent! Keep up the good work!
There wasnt a high chairs at the restraunts for young children to eat on. The food choice was very limited.
"Having visited the Park 10 years ago, I was disappointed with my recent visit. The landscaping is fantastic but the birdlife numbers were very much down on the previous visit. The food at the cafes was disgusting and over-priced"
"Hi Jurong Birdpark,When we were there, the weather was bad, it rained heavily after we arrived when we were waiting for one of the bird shows, I think it was king of the skies or something to do with prey/eagles.It rained heavily and we were not able to watch the show at all, but that is understandable. What's not acceptable is that everyone that was there for the show had to squeeze behind the small shelter behind the viewer seatings, waiting for the rain to end or to be less heavy so that we can make it to other shows.The bird park should have some contingency for these scenarios so that visitors can still move back to the main entrance hall in the event umbrellas are not available instead of being stranded at one location.My suggestion may not be suitable as the park is meant to be"
"It's a bit disappointing compared to the Singapore Zoo and Night Safari. The merit is that you can cover it in half a day. With the overhead train replaced by one which runs on the road, and minimal changes to the show - it cannot attract repeat customers. Unless you absolutely love birds"
"Overall just Ok. Not convenience if without own transport, very hard to get cab or even grab from there to go home."
"African Waterfall AviaryThe African Waterfall Aviary is the second largest walk-in aviary in the world, covering 2 hectares (4.9 acres) and including more than 600 free-flying birds of more than 50 species. The aviary is named after the 30-metre (98 ft) tall Jurong Falls, one of the world's tallest man-made waterfalls. Species include the golden-breasted starling, turacos and the hoopoe.Dinosaur DescendantsIn one corner of the zoo there is a section full of flightless birds: ostriches, emus, rheas and cassowaries are the residents of this exhibit.Wings of AsiaVisitors can see the largest collection of Southeast Asian birds, which has over 200 species. There are large, central walk-in aviaries and peripheral aviaries housing the more delicate and territorial birds. A thunderstorm is simulated at noon each day, followed by a cool, light drizzle. Territorial species are kept in large cages, while species that can coexist with each other (fruit doves and pigeons being two examples) are left to roam freely in the aviary.Lory LoftThe Lory LoftAbout nine storeys high and covering 3,000 square metres (32,000 sq ft), the Lory Loft is the world's largest walk-in flight aviary for lories and lorikeets, with over 1,000 free-flying lories. The ambience is similar to that of a rainforest valley in tropical Northern Australia. Visitors can offer the lories a special nectar mix.Penguin CoastPenguinsHouses five species of penguins within 1,600 square metres (17,000 sq ft). Featuring a 21-metre (69 ft) tall Portuguese galleon faÃ§ade and designed to resemble a ship, the interior of Penguin Coast is constructed with timber beams and wooden flooring. Penguin Coast is home to the Humboldt, rockhopper, macaroni and king penguins, which live in an indoor, climate-controlled den with access to an outdoor enclosure showcasing African penguins, one of the few species that are adapted to the tropics. Joining them are cape shelducks and gulls.World of DarknessAsia's first nocturnal bird house features a system of reverse lighting, converting day to night and vice versa. On display are 60 birds from 17 species, like the night herons, fish owls, boobook owls and snowy owls. It is akin to a quiet nocturnal walk along a starlit jungle path, watching birds in their nocturnal surroundings and hearing them beckon each other.Pelican CoveVisitors catch a glimpse of all seven species of pelicans, including the endangered Dalmatian pelican. There is a board-walk where visitors can stroll and observe the birds. Visitors can also see the pelicans at the world's first underwater viewing gallery for pelicans, where the birds scoop up fish at feeding time.ShowsHigh Flyers ShowSalmon-crested cockatooThis bird show has the world's largest number of performing birds in a single act. Besides highlighting the antics of talented birds like the mimicking cockatoos, this show is also a window onto the natural behaviour of birds like pelicans, flamingos and hornbills.Kings of the Skies ShowVisitors watch birds of prey such as eagles, hawks and falcons, who will fly in loops and soar above the treetops. Visitors also learn about falconry as these birds are put through their paces in a simulated hunt.Lunch with the Parrots"
"Can visit once. Bring your camera too because in the shows we will take only video. Don't miss the bird show it will be conducted at 11am and 3pm. Hawk arena show at 10am and 4pm. After birds show we can take photos with flamingo. We can pass our camera to the people and they will take photo. Opening time will be 8:30am to 6pm. You can get ticket in very cheap rate with some vendors. Don't miss ice penguin section it will swim very nicely, Parrot paradise and wet land (but bit smelly)."
The temperature is hot so be sure to bring cold water and some wide brimmed hat. Remarkable varieities of birds and lovely novelty shops.
"May be because it was a rainy day or may be not, we did not find most attractions compelling. Best was of course the famed high flyers and the beautiful waterfalls trails. The staff seem very committed which was great."
Do yourself a favour and combine this with a visit to the Zoo or Safari on the same day as the Bird Park is quite small and can easily be completed in 2-3 hours. We had a little stroll around the park and saw the 3 PM show before departing. Didn't spend that long here and there's not that much to see in comparison to the zoo.
"Nice.....well, if your children are desperate to see birds and you feel like spending another few hundreds of dollars and a day in a crowded busy hot park....then go. The smell of birds is a bit annoying. The heat here a bit hotter than anywhere else. Very crowded with mostly Asian tourists (yet another annoying aspect). Sort of fun for kids. If you have to choose - then go to the ZOO and Night Safari instead!!!"
It takes nearly an hour to wait in the station 1. The park should provide more trams in the peak hour.
"We payed to have lunch with the Parrots, we expected more than what we got, the buffet lunch was cold, not tasty at all, the steal tables did not have tablecloths at advertised and the chairs were dirty, you only saw the parrots when they did the show and not brought to your tables as the photo showed, they did have a good display of birds in the park."
"This venue is too expensive. By the time we added our fares there from Orchard Road it cost my wife and myself $100.It wasn't worth that. Take for instance the huge so called largest in the world wired over cage. There were only about ten birds in there. I expected clouds of birds flying everywhere.Without the tram to go to each area, it wouldn't be possible to walk it. So entrance fee for two plus the tram was $70 alone.I would have saved the money."
The park took us 4-5 hours. This included two shows and 4 feedings which were the highlight. Some birds in cages were pretty hard to see like the hornbill. Go early. Very far from the city. Almost no public transport. We took a cab. Can make for a long day.
Disappointed with peter rabbit theme. Limited eateries option. Difficult for young family to find suitable dining option and spend longer time in park.
I am not a bird watcher but yes the place has got beautiful birds to see and the noises of the birds are like music. May be you can go
Could not find a single owl in the bird park. Will never go back again. Food and drink were tip top expensive. Ice lemon tea at $5.50/CUP.
"Too many mosquitos at the Aquatic area with fishes, need to bring repellent especially if you are bringing kids there. Mosquito patches doesn't work."
"A lot of the birds were kept in aviaries that were quite small, especially given the large size of some of the birds (e.g. the birds of prey) and the number of birds kept in one cage (e.g. the macaws). They all should have been in way bigger areas. However, some of the birds were kept in forested areas with netting to keep them in, so they had a lot of space to fly around. But most seemed in smaller aviaries."
The bird park was ok there was lots of different birds to view the park felt a little run down but nevertheless the birds all seemed well cared for.
No need to include tram ride while purchasing entry tickets to bird park unless you have very senior people or infants in your team. Stations of tram are in such a way that you cannot enjoy some attractions in between
"Quite a trek by public transport,a metro and a short bus ride.There are some interesting and beautiful species there, some were hidden in a lot of foliage so we couldn't see them. There is a lot to see.There are various bird shows and enough to keep you amused. We particularly enjoyed the visit to the parrot enclosure.Sadly we didn't have much time, so it was a whirlwind visit."
"Great attraction for bird lovers, Pools Amphitheatre show was good. Overall, an average experience.."
"Best experience would be the lory Loft attraction.. but somehow I felt that the number of birds in the enclosure has lessened compared to several years ago..Therefore the ratio of birds to humans are lesser.. with the purchasing of food to feed the birds with the large number of tourists, makes the birds feel overly full.. you hardly have the chance to feed it for more than 10 secs before it gets bored and flew away.. so get your cameras ready!I suggest the bird park to add more birds into Lory Loft enclosure.. how about the peacock? I didn't notice it too, previously I do see it.. as a local, I feel this attraction needs to further improve to serve tourists better.."
"It was my best place to go, but when I went there just now. The mono-rail has gone. But I'm still looking forward to the extension of the zoo combined with this bird park."
"If you have already visited the Zoo & Night safari, you will slightly get bored. Because the infra, atmosphere everything reminds same. So it will be like 3rd time doing same thing. But the birds make you really live. They have such a good collection of birds. Especially parrots, Flamingos are highlights.But give 2nd or 3rd priority. If you bought 4 parks together passes, then don't miss it. Its worth vising once."
The kids enjoyed the bird watching..but the adults found it too tiring walking around up and down the slopes since the park is located at the sides of a hill. Taking the tram won't be fun since you will not be able to see the birds (in the cage) up close.
"Some of the birds are able to roam freely about in lots of open space. Others, on the other hand (especially the parrots) are confined to relative small enclosures. There is a lovely waterfall and you can take a tram ride around the park. The place is pretty in parts but I felt was spoilt by the enclosures. The gift shop sells some cool items that are reasonably priced. There are cafes throughout the park. We ate at one and if you order an Asian dish, the food was good."
"It is a memorable celebration for the birthday boy, as well as an educational tour for the children. Food served was not fantastic though."
We were 4 adults and 2 children visited this October'17 here. I had very high expectations from this place thinking this is a specialized Bird Park in Singapore. But my expectations let down I feel. This is hyped place and not worth the entry tickets being charged. There are lot of birds here but surely not worth the price.
Need more entertainment. More beautiful birds. Places to view. Not at the hill. Convenient for everyone to enjoy walking and watching the birds.
This park was rated as amazing on handy and trio advisor however a few things let us down. Even though I'd pre purchased tickets it took 15 mins to get them verified and us to get let in. Very wierd ..The park is nice and veryyyy long to walk I feel that there wasn't enough birds let out loose to interact with as there could have been... most birds were caged...The biggest let down was the water park it was down for repairs.. it was what we were really looking forward to for our baby on that hot day. They could have mentioned it! We would have come back on a day it was open..The birds are beautiful and worth a visit if you get tickets off HANDY I wouldn't pay full price for this...Definitely take photos with the gorgous biting bird and do the forest walk... really nice
"From an average visitor perspective, I think it is not as many things to see as zoo.From my personal view, I enjoy it."
Glad to have annual ticket promotion going on for just 1 day ticket. My child 9 months was very entertained with the live bird shows. Downside was that some animal spaces were not maintained very well. Flamingos had a foul smell and penguins viewing glass had a lot of poop stains.
Been there but i didn't enjoyed here much as i find the place little boring for people who are not into birds .. Its a must for birds who want to capture photos of them Like i saw many wildlife photographers there clicking pictures.. it's to far away from the city
"There should be clearer signs to direct people to the area where penguins are being fed. Many were misled to the penguins venue and waited for over 15mins only to realise we had missed the feeding outside. The bird show was great and the children enjoyed it. It was disappointing when we realised the water play area was closed. Would be great if this was highlighted in the website homepage or at entrance so that we could manage our children's expectations. The bird park rangers were friendly and helpful, making the experience pleasant. Thank you."
This was an attractive park to visit with plenty of varied birds to see. You can take a tram around the site to get your bearings as it is a lot of walking. The thing I didn't like was seeing the larger birds in small cages.There are places to eat and good signage. Do drink plenty of water.
"The trip was enjoyable overall. Many different species of birds and the layout of the Park made it easy to move around and accessible. Staff were friendly and approachable. Only downsides were that there arent many places to eat inside, only a small cafe kind of thing at the lory loft, the rest we could find were stalls. Let's be honest, the stalls are overpriced. We also had brought park hopper tickets to go to night safari after, so the tickets in my inbox were in the order of BP,NS,BP,NS etc. Instead of scanning all the bird park tickets, he just scanned the first 5, which included a few of our night safari tickets. When I asked him, he just waved me off and said it didn't matter. Well it did, we got held up by the night safari staff who couldn't understand what we were saying and ended being late to one of the shows, missing the whole thing pretty much. But besides that, would recommend again."
especially wet zone where the kid is playing but some of wet zone like drainage n floor is a bit disappointed ovarall
Limited birds are available and majority of the birds are caged. I've been to several bird parks where the birds get to walk freely.
"Although I don't like zoos, after reading all of the good comments, I decided to give it a go. I should have listened to my heart. It was a waste of time.There were many kids during my visit who seemed to enjoy very much and made a lot of screaming and noise. Most of birds are in cages so no good for photos. It is no point to try to observe the birds as one can do in the wild. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who is a natural life lover."
"Nothing much to write home about. It is a place for people who love birds, that is it. Perhaps, it is one of the only bird parks around in the world but then, does it make sense to cage so many birds. Anyways, the highlight of the park are the 2 live events that they have - Kings of the Skies and High Fliers Show. Do check the timings of these events before you step in to the park. They are worth watching (heck, looks like they are the only ones worth watching).Also, there is a small water play area around in the Jurong Bird Park which kids might love to splash around. It does tend to get a bit monotonous and with so much walking around, kids might enjoy in the water play area, so do remember to take your children's water clothes and a new set of change clothes if they want to go in the water play area. It is nothing fancy but then, getting wet with couple of slides is so much fun for the kids.There is a single bus that travels from the Boon Lay MRT that goes to the Jurong Bird Park, right up to its gate, Bus No. 194. You need to get down at Boon Lay MRT and take the Exit D and go to the Boon Lay Interchange where in there are numerous stops for various buses with Bus No. 194 at one end for Jurong Bird Park. While coming back, you just need to get out of the Jurong Bird Park, cross the road, under the flyover and get on the other side and take the same bus to reach Boon Lay MRT.Bus service in Singapore is awesome and it is worth the money one pays for.Just do remember to buy an EZ Link Card the day you step in to Singapore - it costs about SGD 12 (SGD 5 for the card and SGD 7 for usage). But boy is this card helpful - any bus, MRT you can just tap in and tap out. No need to fish for change and ask for how much is it to travel to the destination. You can top it out at any of the MRT so you are good to go. Alternatively, ask the hotel you are staying at, whether they can provide you with a used EZ Link card - that way you can save that SGD 5 of the cost of the card too."
This as it tells y a bird Park it requires walking even if y take the little train in order to look into the enclosures -it is well laid out on a large hill with lakes etc -the eagles were my favourite-- the length of time spend depends on y but three hours did me
"I did not enjoy the place much as I hate to see birds in cages. That said, this place is sure to delight children who can have a close encounter with birds. It does have a very large variety of birds in capitivty there."
The park should have more slops so that young child on pram or on the child wagons can have easy access as there are afew places with stairs and hard to manoeuvre around. And there should have more English maps are those that are available are in Korean and Chinese language.
"If you have seen Mysuru Zoo, you will find this place a tad too boring. The parrots enclosure was closed for upgradation when we went. The High Flyers show was good though."
"it has lots of greenery and bunch of happy birds, shows are the attraction and very nice, but morning show got cancelled due to rain.but have some suggestions to improve:1. Tram is totally waste of money and useless - its a multi bogey fossil fuel driven belching unburnt fuel smell, which has like 3 stops which are useless as you have to walk to each enclosure. They should learn from Delhi zoo, where battery driven single bogey tram continuously move around so you visit one enclosure and then can catch the next one to go farther.2. there are few trams, so you wait endlessly for one to come, and after the shows or on crowded days, this is quite painful3. the strollers provided are not ergonomical nor shaded, they should check with Universal studios, as rental charge is almost same"
Somehow I didn't liked this place as this was our last thing to do in our list. Still I will recommend this too skip this. Zoo night safari river safari were so good that you just fell like why we have come here. If you have time den take a walk dere. It's far also.
"The park is worth a visit even though a little dated, showing its age, and a little pricey at $34. The bird show is fun and kids will love it. Take a seat on the terraces near the 2nd or 4th aisle half way up, and the birds will zoom over your heads. Look for the perches at the entrance. The finale is brilliant, get your video camera handy."
The place is good but far off with no other addons in near by area. One show of birds is good and the other one is average. Max 2-3hrs with a Very relaxed walk. In one enclosure you can feed beautiful birds who would come and sit of your hand for food. That's the only fun part for a photo session . Visit only if you have spare time else avoidable.
"Nice place and fun for families but showing its age. It is overpriced for what it offers. Nevertheless, we spent an enjoyable couple of hours here, taking in the 3pm High Fliers bird show which was fun, then doing a circuit in the tram which cut out having to walk uphill in the humidity. One of the best parts is the gift shop and cafe next to the Entrance. We were told that the park may be shifting to Singapore Zoo within a couple of years which might explain why the place is slowly running down."
Nothing very special compared with average zoo with the birds. And also quite far from the city center. My kids only liked to feed the birds. Recommend only if you have spare time to spend after visiting the zoo nearby.
"The bird park is good, but being a photographer I could not alway get the shot I wanted because of the small wire on the cages.Some birds were very hard to findThey did have mobility scooters that were a great help as to walk around is about 3km."
"Its good for kids and especially for people who have never been to a bird park before (say San Diego), otherwise its okay. what is good, is that it is walkable for elderly people and children. I was in time for the show, during afternoon, and i was overall impressed.Now some practical stuff:1) In case you tend to use MRT, come to Boon Lay station, head straight towards the bus terminal on the ground floor and ask for the bus number (i forget now), its 15 minutes then. So if are a group and not on tight budget, might as well as take a cab!2) Jurong Bird park and Night safari are two different places. First thing, you should ask is when the bus departs from Bird Park to the Jurong Night Safari. We did not ask as we did not know nor was there any board which says the two are different. Hence we missed the 5 pm bus and instead took the cab"
"We are a fam of 4 .We are adults .We got a package combining the JURONG bird park , the ZOO, and another place which I cannot recover and we did not go also due lack of time .. If you are really interested in birds you will be thrilled .. I went mainly for penguins . lol . It was quite hot and you gotta walk uphill and down for visiting . They got a really huge children's park which is really cute . They have some water themed park for kids as well don't forget to bring the swimsuits. Overall it was quite good . but u have to walk a lot"
Certainly a large selection of bird life.Park is getting on in years and it does show.While kept clean some areas look a little tired and in need of a spruce up.
"I'm not sure if I went on the wrong day or something because on the day I went to visit Jurong Bird Park, the place was lifeless; not the way it was when I last visited 10years ago."
"I like birds so I joint a group tour to the bird park. The park is smaller than I expected, so was the varieties of the birds. It maybe better fit for children. As the small train took us around the park, the audio recording introduced to us the various areas and their residents. After getting off the train, I headed to the first of the two bird shows I had planned to see. It was quite entertaining, especially when audients were invited to take part in the event. Because of the rain the second show was cancelled ."
"We have visited many bird parks in Australia and away overseas e.g. KL and I was disappointed - I was expecting same standard as the zoo - I can see they are moving the bird park to the new zoo location -as its looking very tired ,,, but the bird park was old and run down and cages were historic looking. The zoo was very spread out so you had to walk long ways till you saw something and felt bit lonely in parts- the kids were hot and found it bit hard going.the only good part was the lorikeet enclosure but the variety in here was not great - they had a few friendly vareitys of lorikeets birds but some of the rainbow lorikeets were bit testy and angry..was a lovely enclosure but having a good vast variety of birds everywhere would be a brilliant tourist attraction. looking forward to seeing the new location."
Bird park has lot of amazing birds and shows. Not to miss the lorry loft. Must visit if you have time in singapore.
Its not near or connected to the Singapore Zoo or Night Safari. Its a good 20min taxi ride away.The park visit needs a half day. Preferably starting at noon. All the bird shows after this time will be in a cooler temp and more enjoyable. Make sure to carry enough drinking water .And a good camera.
In Jurong Bird Park is a collection of bird species from various countries. There we also presented some attractions of the show of several birds and they showed their abilities guided by the animal trainers.
"good and well maintained, nothing big of sort. less birds, no walk with birds, waste of time. better do in kuala lumpur."
Visit the place if you young children who love birds. Nothing much. Can give it a miss. Bird show might excite you if you havent seen one so far. Or else a pretty OK place to spend a good 3 hrs time.
"Overall is still ok, quite a large collection of different species of birds. The show is still acceptable but nothing to shout about."
Its well maintained park with variety of unseen birds... Its widespread and has many bird shows as well.. Main drawback for is was the weather. It was so hot the the kids couldn't enjoy as they should be. We also missed few shows just becoz of the hot weather... Taking parrots were missing as I've heard they are wonderful but this time couldn't see them..
This place is nice but not as expectations built on seeing its picture on media. If one visit one should not miss the shows.
"The Bird Park experience for us was meh! Sure you can see lots of different birds, but after having visited the Zoo the previous day, we weren't too impressed with the park. One can get discounted tickets in combination (Zoo + Bird Park) so if you take that option it's not a bad place to go."
"The Jurong bird park is very beautiful and well maintained, however, I would not recommend the place if you are short on time or are a solo / couple traveler.That is unless you are interested in birds and wildlife.Firstly, it is very far from the airport or main city. Secondly, you cannot club this with any other place as there are no major attractions nearby.The macaws were the highlights and if possible do try and attend the parrot show, it is very entertaining."
"jurong is a huge open bird park where we can observe all sorts of birds in their natural habitat.but i don't recommend it as a very nice place after seeing the zoo,river safari and night safari.its not very interesting where you have to walk a lot despite of tram facility.i feel it is money waste and moreover faraway from the city and you have to travel all the way long just for it....its almost takes 30-45 min in a taxi from city center to reach there..."
"We enjoyed our visit but the overall feeling was one of claustrophobia, probably exacerbat d by the humid conditions. Feeding the lorys was fun and the birds are spectacular close up. As a keen naturalist I was sad to see the birds caged."
The Jurong Bird park is a must visit bird park for the kids. The adults wont like it so much. The park has many beautiful birds all around. They host bird shows on timely intervals as well.
"It's really an amazing place to watch birds in flight.As I learned that they are planning to move the park to mandai, we decided to give it a visit.In my opinion, it is a good decision to move. As we are walking around the park, we could smell funny scents coming from the nearby factories.and while watching one of the bird shows, we can hear car and motorbike sounds from the back.But I still love the attraction, the beautiful nature!"
They have tried to do something good with exotic and trained birds along with conservation. Its a good place for kids. Don't go with high expectations and it's fun. The shows are also worth seeing as they demonstrate ability of different trained birds.
"This is far from the city center and other attractions. I had high expectations on this, but was disappointed with variety of birds as compared to KL Bird Park, which is a walk-in Aviary. It is a really poor by Singapore standards, and would have rated that way except for the water play area for the kids."
"This is not the first time we visited this park. We enjoy this park, specially its good to introduce young children to the many different birds.The park is organized by sections, depending by the kind of birds. Its size is quite extensive, so if you go with young children, I suggest you take the tram ride. Also dont forget your sunblock!!It is a great park, even for adults.I gave the park a 3 stars because it lacks of dining option. When we visited the park, the only option is only at the entrance of the park, or the buffet option inside the park.The fact that a restaurant is located at the entrance minimized you to dine at you own convenient time, either you eat before or after you tour the park, although this dining place have good selections.The buffet option however give yourself the convenient timing to dine according to your liking, it also have option for dinining with bird show, which is fun for the children. But the food in this place is really bad, food is bland, selection is limited. Fruit, ice cream, and coffee is available.I woul not recommend to dine here if you do not intend to entertain your children with the bird show."
Im not a bird fan to start with but our 14yo is so this was his pick. Birds in cages... some open aviaries but 1 was closed when we went. Decent variety of birds. Lots of hills and steps but there is tram that goes around if you have trouble walking but still some steps to tackle. And u pay extra for the tram but not much. Very damp place due to the tropical area etc and lots of mosquitos. Was a very hot day and not a lot of areas to cool off. We wouldn't go back if we visited again and even our 14yo said the same. Lots more interesting and fun things to do in singapore.
April is probably not the best month to travel to the bird park. It was hot and the steep walking trails with a large pram can be tiring.The birds themselves are well laid out and would be interesting to many. The flamingos and the ibis are beautifulA half day well spent
Whilst a serious attempt has been made to present these birds sympathetically it is a little sad to see majestic birds in cages that are really not large enough for some of the larger vultures and eagles etc. Children will probably love the smaller birds flying free which can be fed by hand on the walkways. This bird park. Bird shows are given throughout the day and at feeding times and will keep the kids entertained
"Admittedly we went during the rainy season (uhm... yeah, I know) but there were too many mosquitos and we all came out massacred. The birds are interesting, but it's too expensive for what you get."
The weather was bad on the day we travelled but even then we enjoyed seeing the birds. The waterfall is beautiful
Nothing has changed here since our last visit. May be okay for a first visit. More enjoyable for children
"Before there was a monorail, seems some things are a bit outdated now, but still a big collection of birds, and lots to see"
Jurong bird park has lot of parrots from all over the world. They offer a bird show where birds sing and show various tricks and then they have a 100 ft man-made waterfall which is beautiful to look at. They also have a small variety of other birds but the park still has a long way to go. In my opinion calling it a bird park is not justified and they can work on improvements. My recommendation is to opt for it as a side trip only if you have time.
"Just like the name, they really have a wide range of birds from flamingos to parrots to idk what else. They have a section within the park where you can buy their food for around $2 (per cup) so you can attract the birds to eat it from your cup. They have few shows as well, so come like 10-15mins before to secure your seats."
"As I love birds, this is the third time we've been here and I confess I was a little disappointed this time. I find it particularly annoying that although the enclosures are labelled with the name of the bird(s) species, there is no map or in most cases any indication of where they come from. This seems like a fairly fundamental thing that should be there. As Singapore does most things so well, this is disappointing."
This place has a variety of birds to look at and one can spend around 3-4 hrs going through the place.There are food stops inside as well in case you get tired.But we felt that the Singapore zoo had much more to see than the Jurong bird park..And some parts were not maintained that well.Like the water was smelling as it had not been changed.They have some bird shows which were nice.
"Me and my family visited Jurong Bird Park on 24th Dec 2016. Transportation to Jurong is very easy via MRT or Bus. It is highly connected to both. Overall park experience and the bird species are good and one time must go kind of. But the only must watch show is High Flyer Show. Pelican chit Chat and kings of the Sky shows are really boring and not that interactive. As we visited Singapore in rainy season so it is highly recommended to carry umbrella. A small water play area called Birdz of play was the most enjoyable place for my kids, so carry ur swim wears along. I am vegetarian and the food options for me everywhere were ice cream, potato fries and chips so better to carry your own home-made sandwiches, as there are many places for sitting n resting over there to enjoy ur food and the food joints are little bit over priced. Do not buy souvenirs from this place, for that the best place is China town. On public holidays and weekends Jurong provide a free shuttle service to the nearest MRT station and that is a real relief."
After visiting Zoo and the night safari I had high hopes about the zoo. I was little disappointed to see the same caged birds.Penguin section was the best.
"If you are going to choose between singapore zoo and bird park, I definitely recommend you the zoo!!You won't miss any thing if you don't visit bird park.It's too big and access to the cages are difficult even by tramp.I got sad after visiting, I didn't expect some low quality things from singapore bird park.For example there was a pungent smell around flamingos pound or the most of the vitrine's windows of bird discovery center were covered by steam and it was hard to see what's inside.The shows were interesting don't miss them.The design of the park is nice and unique and suitable for photography."
"We heard so much about this bird park, it is away from the city center, make sure you buy the ticket for the tram it worth the price, exhibits are good but not a whole lot to see and forget about the foods they sell very bad, worth talking the children to go if you have nothing better to do"
"It was great as there were so many species of birds and was quite amazed at the owl exhibits and there was a musuem to learn more facts about birds as well.However, the attraction that I was most looking forward to, which was the Lory Loft, as I had a lot of memories as a child there, was quite disappointing as there aren't many birds compared to last time, and it was hard to try to get birds to even eat or come near you, which I felt I wasted money to buy the food (which was some liquid compared to seeds last time and the liquid attracted a LOT of bees) and was a disappointing experience, but could be due to the timing that I went which was around afternoon(not sure if it affects). But overall it was a great experience and it's a relaxing place to visit in Singapore."
"The penguins, Horn Bills are splendid and not seen often. The show at amphitheatre is really good. Ensure you are there by 15:00 hrs to experience it daily ."
"It's a very pretty garden park, sometimes so bushy you can't see the birds! I would have liked to get closer to macaws etc but the ones displayed were there if you wanted a paid photo. The flight show was great."
"The parrots were a delight, as were the owls and penguins but there was no proper policing or staff checking on how some other tourists were walking around banging on exhibits and cages, and the Andean Condors and similar enclosures were quite small for the birds in question.PS: make sure you bring bug spray!"
"This place is good for natural lovers, as one can find different birds and there research. It is accessible through metro and bus station."
"We were there on rainy day. Most shows were canceled and birds were not visible in most places. Bird feeding experience was nice, but most birds are overfed and show little interest. Kids would enjoy. Lots of walking. Wear good shoes."
We had great expectations from this place but were disappointed. May be because of the heat. Nothing great.
I was a bit disappointed. I thought there would be more walk through and more hands on. Most are in cages and the shows are their attraction. On entry you can have your picture taken but not with the macaws. As I own a macaw(12mths old) I wanted a pic with the red or blue but that was a no go! Extremely disappointed.
Visited there as kids enter free for this Oct. Nice place especially for the family . But have to bear the heat under the hot sun . Foods Inside a bit expensive.
it was ok.please skip the lunch with the parrots.that was just terrible. and the food was inedible.
"As quoted,most spectacular bird park in the world,it's definitely not. Most of the birds were ill fed and were crying vociferously for food. Their boisterous noises were evident of the fact that park keepers definitely didn't look after them well. Not the best collection and definitely not a good outing for a sunny day. Prefer winter season to visit here and is steep priced for what they offer inside. Not happy."
"Suggest to go to this place first before others. This bird park had been around for more than 45 years and it's showing ... though you can tell a lot of effort still goes to the feather friends to maintain an enjoyable visit. Also u can tell there have been constant upgrading to upkeep the interest of this place. The two shows are alright, some parts are actually quite impressive but pale in comparison to the zoo and night safari. Also little interactive between the birds and visitors. The children water play and playground are loads of fun so do plan extra time. We went at 2pm, watch the two shows, spent an hour in the water play and left with very little time to explore and understand the birds. The park closes at 6pm. Looking forward to the move to Mandai, u can bet it will be exciting. So come back in 2020!"
The Jurong Bird Park has been renovated some time back and it is definitely not the same when I visited during my childhood time.It has much more varieties and more organised. It also has playgrounds and water playground to cater for the not-so patient kiddos.Worth the visit!
"When I heard there was a bird park in Singapore I was excited, as I love birds. I was a tad dissapointed whilst wandering around though honestly. The food was very overpriced, although it did come with a souvenir cup. The park itself was large, and had a few hills. For someone like me who has physical illnesses, I found it difficult in the heat. I did see transportation go past in the grounds, but I couldn't see any signage around as to what it was or the cost if any. I did however see the bird park had wheelchairs and prams for rent which was great. As for the birds, 8 felt a bit sorry for them. Their enclosures seem to have everything they need in there, but some of them seemed a bit cramped. The bird show I saw was good, but it wasn't very interactive with the audience which was a shame, and it seemed that if you got there early and sat up front, then you were punished by not being one of the chosen few who got to interact with the birds. They did however offer free photos at the end, but tbh It felt as if you'd be giving them the rights to use your image by letting them take your photo, and so I sadly declined. Jurong bird park has the makings of a great place, and the staff were lovely for the most part. I hope peoole see the potential in this bird park, and it continues to grow with time and money invested."
Surrounded by Indian nationals on that day...Really feel like we were in India.... couldn't even find an ATM that I could use as the only ones available there is from the State Bank of India.
"My children were looking forward to seeing the park but even they were left a little deflated. There are some very good exhibits like the waterfall aviary and the pelican grove but the lory loft and penguin coast were a let down. The Penguins reminiscent of a scene in Happy Feet stuck behind a glass window was rather boring and the lory loft was saturated by far too many people. Like most attractions in the world, visit this place during the week to get the best experience.The aviary waterfall was amazing and peaceful, also the birds inside were very colourful. There is another exhibit called Jungle Jewels, that is worth visiting too and much more to look at than the lory flora and fauna was exemplary too, lots of lovely trees and flowers to look at and take pictures of.Overall the place is clean and tidy but the exhibits could, or should, be more spacious for bigger birds. Staff are very friendly, like most of Singapore, and could find smiles out of the grumpiest people. Didn't have any food as brought own in and plenty of water fountains to fill up from."
"Went here with my friend as we both like bird watching. All was going really well, seeing native birds getting some easy food, until we went into the large aviary. Yes it is big, yes it has an amazing waterfall but it also had a parrot. There was an African Grey parrot which decide to get over friendly with my friend. Kept trying to land on her and if you have ever got close to a parrot you will know that their beaks are very strong. Nothing we did would deter the beast so we had to leave.I sent the park an email but have heard nothing. Just wonder what would have happened if that had been a child on the receiving end??The rest of the park was lovely but that incident had left a bad taste."
"It was a hot sunny weekend when I visit the park. It is advise to visit early when the park first open as to avoid the hot sun.You could take the tram ride around the park, o4 like what we did stop at station 1 and explore the birds around that station. The one I enjoy was the canopy area where the birds roam freely within. You have an option to buy some food and feed the birds at sg3 each cup.The park size is walkable I did walk the rest of the way around the park from there on. Enjoyed the parrot, Eagles n vultures. Flamingo are pretty too.Don't forget to get some chilling air on at the penguin station. Over all, It was fun n relaxing."
I went there because of my wife and kid. I am not really a bird's lover but was really amazed to see some of the birds inhabitant there. One of the best things were many of the shows which happens there. They all are amazing shows. One should really watch all the shows. I found these shows better than visiting birds at their cages.
"Hmm this place is a little overrated, I love love love birds and was looking forward to visiting the bird park all week however felt it was a bit disappointing. Maybe I hyped it up too much, but it all seemed too large and empty. We fed the lorikeets in the enclosure but left rather early after 2-3hrs even though I thought we would spend the whole day there. Be prepared to do lots of walking."
The location is quite distance from the city and can be reached by taxi. The bird park is not massive but they have a selection of bird that taken a good care. I like the waterfall the most. The walk can be done in a short time. Another interesting species live here is the penguins. They look healthy and taken a good care not like in the other bird park where the bird was look pitiful.
"Rumor has it that the Jurong Bird Park is slated for moving closer to the Zoo area in the next few years. Because of this, there has been no new exhibitions for some years and the park is looking very dated now. Still an interesting place to visit and worth it if you get a 4 park ticket for the Zoo/Night Safari. Still, traveling out to Jurong can be difficult for those who do not know their way around Singapore and hopefully in the coming years the Bird Park will shine again."
Was a pleasant day out. Not as much here as I thought there would be but over all it was nice. It was great to see but once I have seen it I don't think I would hurry back.
"If you a bird lover or want to watch different kinds of birds, then this is the place.As I am not a big bird lover, I just visited for the sake of it and it didn't disappoint me. Lot of shows and also you can have lunch with parrots, but everything is charged."
Really disappointed as had read real Gud reviews n was really expecting a lot of interactive sessions as well variety like they had a few years back..Kuala lumpur bird park is far superior..The bird shows are average..You have to pay for everything...The lunch with parrots is a real hoax as they do not bring d parrots anywhere near you n incase you want a picture you have to pay 10$ after paying 25$ for lunch..It should be more clearly defined..Really disappointed!!!
"It is a nice place where you will find loads of varieties of birds. Really loved watching the orange flemingos..they were just awesome! If you are going with children, let me warn you there is a lot of walking and it is tiring. So kindly plan accordingly."
"I found this park to be old , tired and quite anachronistic in it's layout and it's birdlife.Bird in cages are no longer appropriate and the park needs a massive revamp."
"I brought my mother and sister here to celebrate my mother's birthday (Singaporeans get free entry on their birthdays). Service crew were pleasant and welcoming, and pretty professional too.Park space, though small, was well utilised, with many exhibits presented nicely. Do not underestimate the size of the park: there are actually many exhibits to cover amongst the hidden pathways! Over so many years (last I visited was over 10 years ago), much of the flora and fauna have matured, lending a natural touch to the park's atmosphere.My gripe is that the park is not easily accessible, and that ticket prices are not actually attractive enough to encourage repeated visits, especially for locals. Its a pity that the monorail could not be retained. I could see that the stations have been repurposed though.Overall, it was a nostalgic visit that allowed me to relive my childhood days. Good for a one off visit, but it will be a while before I return again."
"I ended up there only because of my sons interest in birds. As far as Zoos go it is well set up with a good collection of Hornbills. I just don't like any animal locked up behind bars, but if you have no opportunity to see them in their habitat, it is a fair substitute."
"Jurong Bird Park being one of the must go Tourist attraction in Singapore, has been a wonderful attraction all these years.Went there again with my kids and wife. Honestly speaking, they haven't do a facelift or improvement for many years. I seriously feel they ought to revamp the park, to keep it up to trend. The huge indoor aviary has always my children's favorite spot in the park. That is something you can get up close and personal with birds in there.Food & beverage in the park not worth the value spend. High priced or over priced food without quality. We had to eat there just for the sake of the children."
"The bird park is nice but not in wet weather, so make sure you take an umbrella as storms eventuate quickly. The exhibits are lovely and the greenery is so beautiful. Several eating spots within the park are good to take refuge when it rains."
Bit far from the central. Quite big park and very clean. Have monorail to trip around the park from the above. Birds shows quite ok other than pretty standard nothing too special too.
"Perhaps we were visiting at the wrong time,it was raining. Nothing much to see. Even my 4 years old daughter were asking where are the birds inside the cage,most of the cages looks like empty. Perhaps the birds were sleeping or just hiding from the rain. But,i still recommend this place,it is to support wildlife reserves."
A nice day activity for children and adults lots of birds in natural habitat. Lot of shows happening around the day. Artificial nature at its best.
"It has been quite a few years since I have last visited Jurong Bird Park. I decided to bring my family to visit during the school holidays. First of all, it was not crowded. I suppose the travelling distance is a key consideration. Second, the exhibits were quite spaced out, and there's a lot of variety of species to view. That's good for avid fans. Third, the walking can be quite tiring. You need to be prepared to walk around for quite a bit. There are not many places for people to rest. Fourth, the shows are not really that fascinating. I must qualify that I have only seen two shows - high fliers and birds of prey. The first one was not that bad, but the second was a little dull.I guess I may be a little more picky because I was comparing this with the Zoo, which offers a lot more different animal species to view and learn about. But it's still worth a visit with your children, especially if you want them to get in contact with nature more often."
"Great variety of birds, lots of attractions, tram to take you around. Trails are walk able but strenuous for those with disabilities. Some cage displays are too small for the animals."
"The JBP is like any other Bird Park, with some exotic Bird collection. Best is the two type of Bird shows conducted at fixed timings. Amazing to see the Birds so well trained, and at comfort among public."
"The place is packed with birds of different sizes and colours. But apart from the shows like the High Flyers Show and others, there is nothing much to see in the area. The whole park can be completed in one hour. Certainly not worth the travel. Only buses go there, and they take a long time to come."
"We arrived just before midday, and was disappointed to find that the shows are in the morning and late afternoon, so as we had to return to our hotel by 4, we missed out on all,shows. We felt some aspects of the park disappointing. the large eagles and vultures were in a small enclosure, and there were many Penguins in what seemed such an unnatural setting, with not much room to swim as they would in the wild. I rate the park just ""ok"""
"Brought my 6 year old to the bird park for a walk. It is quite refreshing to be away from the city. However, in my opinion the birdpark does need new and fresh ideas to invigorate the park. The park itself has great potential to inspire interest and love for birds."
"I love zoos and all other attractions (Singapore Zoo, Night Safari and River Safari) are excellent but this was just ok. Birds are the animals you look at in between the other cool animals, they're filler. My mother loved it but she is 62 and talks to birds all day long. I enjoy a good Hornbill and there was actually a good selection of different species of those.Overall, it is worth a visit once. Good ice cream in the food part."
Good experience. The bird shows conducted in the park is unmissable. Appreciate the efforts put in to train the birds
"The place is in industrial district. They plan to move it in the same area as the zoo. The place is not that big. The ponds are very dirty (with algae, not trash) and smelly of animal poops. The species list is quite extensive. There is few domes where we can get super close to the birds. There is wet area for children. Few restaurant, mostly Indian food for some unknown reason. There is a tram going around the park which you can ride one time before 2 pm and multiple times after 2 pm. The bird shows are must-see events and the bird talks are very educational."
"My family experience in this park is really awesome, the park is clean, the bathroom is clean and the tram mais really handy.What's not gods of it is the service.One of the waitress (near the amphitheater!She can't really speak nicely and she even scolded my sister in law, when she asked ifShe can have the hot water for the kids milk.I really hope the bird park can be develop better and staff can be more friendly"
nice place with many different species. a must visit place if you travelling with kids else can give it a miss if you are not a bird lover
"Jurong Bird Park is not as attractive and good as it was few years back. The Bird shows are more commercial now. The tallest artifical waterfalls fails to make an impression. Have been here in 2001 and 2002. The varities of birds on display and the shows were more realisitc. Even the photos that we take with the birds at the entrance are not appealing.Earlier we were permitted to hold real big colourful birds on our hands and take photos. Now it is like small love birds are made to sit on a holding stand and we have to take photos with them. There are not much takers for this now. Another important aspect noticed was the toilets maintanence. They were not upto the Singapore standards. Very untidy, No tissues in some rooms. And no food available for vegetarians. We and our children had ice cream for lunch as we are pure vegetarians. On the whole was not impressed much with the Jurong Bird Park."
"If you have a healthy heart- ditch the tram! JBP has attractions on either side of a trail-you can thus walk and stop at each attraction, tick it off your map and be done in 3 hours! The tram bypasses lots of the attractions (takes you to key stops)- you would then need to backtrack to cover the rest- which ends up being a pain! You can make it as leisurely or as rushed as you want it.Still- the lory loft is adorable coz the lories are brilliantly colourfully friendly! The large aviaries are wonderful just because the sight of birds flying uplifts you after the cages! Waterfall aviary is impressively man-made. Penguins are an adorable must see!It can get hot, very sweaty and dehydrating. Take sunglasses. The gift shop is a joke (stuffed animal toys) (what!?!).PS. Closest MRT is Boon Lay. Bus 194 from there to park. Cross over to the other side for return bus stop!"
"Visited Jurong Bird park on 6th April, it was really hot & humid out there, Place was not bad at all but due to hot weather we were not able to explore the place."
"Some how this attraction slightly miss fired for me. Whilst the massive thunder and lightening coupled with the rain cancelled the afternoon shows, one can't blame this on the park. Staff, very correctly, were concerned for the public's safety around possible lightning strike. Whilst it is always difficult to make enclosures larger enough for high flying birds I feel the enclosures are getting a bit tired. Still a worth while visit with thousands of different birds and the waterfall is impressive enough in it's own right. Children would be enthralled. mention has been made to relocate the park to Mandai along side the other zoos, a good move I feel."
We really good time at the birdpark. Like all other attaraction in Singapore - the birdpark is really cleanOver all its very nice to visit at least onece if you are in singapore
"My Fiance and I went to this attraction, because he has been there before and was amazed. The small birds had heaps of space which was great to see. However, the bigger birds including the owls, and the ostriches (which lost most of their feathers due to stress i assume) have small spaces. I am usually opposed Zoo's as it is often a miserable view on animals in too small spaces. I wouldn't go again, as besides the small birds, the other birds barely have any room."
Pleasant park - small but had a tram to take you around with a couple of stops. Birds were interesting and varied. The bird show was shorter than expected but the parrots did some clever tricks.A good afternoon visit but not for a whole day.
We went to jurong bird park during our family vacation...and it's a very charming beautiful place to spend a day! Yes it took us an entire day to see the park but it was worth it...they have the whole place done upbeat tidily with lovely migratory birds and have a wonderful bird show which was very exciting for my four year old daughter...carry some air fans as it tends to get very warm but this place is a must visit!
If you are bird lover then you need one complete day to visit Jurong Bird Park. There are 2 live shows which are worth watching and man made tallest waterfall. If you have enough time please visit
We had a close view of some birds. Must visit for bird watchers. The shows are good. Not very crowded.
It a nice experence for a tourist to visit singapore. Can have close view of the bird and interative with the birds during the show.
"Last visited around 2002 when they had a monorail taking you into the park. I felt it lacked something and we did not feel there were as many birds in the huge aviary as we remembered . Those making a first-time visit will probably enjoy it, though."
There is a smaller than expected collection of birds..this makes it a bit slack so while it is great but lets not over rate it...the idea is definitely unique and must be promotedthe last segment of play inwater should be promoted to inform travellers beforehand to bring in swim suits for kids..the store selling stuff is pretty expensive.
this place has great variety of birds and you also get an opportunity to feed them and take pictures too. but it also gets quiet boring after few hours. if you dont have anything to do for half day then you can visit this place. if you skip it too then also no harm.
Actually this bird park was not upto the expectations. The only saving grace was the bird show which was exciting. Other areas were just fine but it certainly should not be on top of a tourists list of places to visit. There are much better places to see in Singapore.
"We visited as we bought the combined ticket from the zoo, although interestingly it's practically Empty here in comparison. Also had we realised the effort it takes to get here we wouldn't have bothered. It's 1 mile from the nearest mrt across very busy roads so we got a taxi for $6 there but getting back we had to ring for one (God know how much that cost me) as they don't stop there and this added $2 to a $10 taxi fare as it was rush hour going back. Some bird displays were great and felt like they were at home but others were in very small cages."
"A peaceful and enjoyable place to visit with nicely maintained park surroundings.The setting is nice, dream place for photographers. It would roughly take 3-4 hours to visit the entire park.There is tram as well which drops you to different station and from where you can visit all birds etc. But prepared to walk a little.Lots of hornbills around."
The shows are good but the park is vast and has lots to walk. The collection of birds is nice though.
"The setting is wonderful and a great place to walk around and enjoy all the beautiful birds. A photographers dream place, we spend a few hours and really enjoy our time here"
Very interesting place specially for children. You have to attend both shows offered. Ideal place to spend three hours in a good-weather day.
"Some nice bird shows. You could possibly see most things in half a day. However, if you want o have an depth view on the birds, you may want more time."
"I have visited this place perhaps three times in my life. Nothing much have changed since my first visit. Unfortunately during my last visit, a lot of attractions were being renovated. We can't even see the penguins during the visit. The shows were nice and well orchestrated. But it might only took you less than 2 hours to explore the whole area due to the space constrains. Compared to the zoo or river safari, I think this park is relatively small. But I have to say, they tried their best to make full use of what they have.To be frank, the ticket price is relatively expensive. So try to get some discounts buy buying a whole package of zoo, river safari, and bird park at the same time. In that way you can enjoy the park with a better price."
They take out most of the bieds from the zoo and made this park... because you wont find any impressive birds left in the zoo...Go early...Transportation is not good...Take a taxi...I had a hard time finding taxi back in the evening
"We took a taxi from hotel near Brash basah station. It took about 30 minutes to get to Jurong, was quite cheap.Jurong was a nice place to stay for few hours, not any longer.We bought tickets to hop on-hop off train (few dollars more) which was good decision,because of the heat! Then we decided places we wanted to see better,and check them out.There was beautiful waterfall and beautiful birds! Restaurants, toilets and the smoking area outside of the park. One restaurant inside the park.Didn't like the fact that parrots was kept on small cages.."
"We had an enjoyable day at Jurong, with the highlight of the day being the High Flyers bird show which included low flying, talking and singing birds. Some enclosures were spacious and enabled visitors to see the birds clearly. Others unfortunately were surrounded by thick wire, with visitors kept at least a meter from the enclosure, which made taking photos and seeing the birds clearly difficult. Other enclosures were quite smelly."
"On this visit to Singapore we visited Jurong Bird Park again. The park is easily accessible by Metro - to BOON LAY station on the east west line then transfer to the bus interchange to Bus No 194 which runs a regular service to and from the bird park.At the bird park we noted that once again Singapore has introduce multiple pricing for locals and tourists - for tourists the entrance fee was $SG 33 (no discount).Several areas of the park we closed for renovations.There is a tram service around the park which stops at three stations - Main Stn, Lorry Loft - well worth a visit to feed the lorikeets and Waterfall stn to visit the indoor waterfall .The park has a huge array of bird life - but on this visit we noted that the park has a run down appearance - needs a coat of paint in may places and many of the aviaries require updating - in fact some of the birds appeared distressed especially in the parrot exhibitsThere are various areas for having a meal - we had lunch in the BONGO BURGERS restaurant - well worth a visitThe main impression we had of the park in this visit is that the park requires an update/renovation"
"Not very exciting place to see exotic see birds. Entry fee is expensive and pay extra for a train raid around the park. Entrants not allowed to take photos with exotic birds, only if entrants have the photos taken by the park's photographer at the entrance of the park. You need to buy feeds to feed rainbow lorikeets."
"We took the MRT from the city to Boon Lay, then we crossed the road to the bus station to get the 194 bus, travel taking circa 90 minutes. Cost to enter the park SGD$28pp.Many of the birds are hard to see as the cages are old, with old thick wire restricting view - no chance of clear photographs as the cage dominates. We appreciate securing the birds in space that does not stress them is essential, but we have been to many bird parks where the cages are much more viewer friendly. A number of displays were closed for improvement work (which is hopefully good news, given our previous comment). We watched one of the twice daily bird shows which was limited and disappointing, having been spoiled by the high quality of a similar style show at Taronga Zoo in Sydney. The talking parrot was amusing and the flamingos walking on stage at the end were the highlights. The walk through areas had few bird species that are rare or excite. Staff were not engaging, unlike the staff at Singapore Zoo.Coffee just before we entered the park was good, but all in all we left feeling disappointed with the visit and value for money."
"This bird park was superb in terms of their collection and display of birds. The high flyer show was quite impressive. The white owls, the flamingos were superb &,lory feeding was worth doing.. Very clean and green surroundings."
"Bird park along with zoo and night safari vwere part of the planned holiday trip. The web page mentioned 45%off on third January, however it was only for locals and foreign tourists were excluded. This was unfortunately only mentioned on another page.Word for advice for tourists is cto buy tickets online. Take a park hopper if planning to visit all the parks.Now for the bird park, its relatively small, but can be very muggy and hot if there is no wind blowing. The shows are good and the highlight. Previously there was opportunity for having pictures with birds sitting on shoulders and hand. Unfortunately they only put small birds on a wooden stick and ask you to hold the stick.The park is in a different location as compared to the zoo. If four poeple then take a taxi. Average fare would be 20$ if coming from the orchard area."
"We found it quite average. Varieties of birds are just ok, not so great! Overall the park is maintained very well. Could not see the birds' show, so cannot comment whether that would have been a differentiator!"
"There are lots of varieties of birds here. But I personally am not too much into birds. So I didnot want to watch all different species of birds except the ones which were famous.There were shows like lunch with parrots and a bird show too. Bird show was good. We didnot try lunch with parrots as we arrived late.There was a separate section for penguins . Penguins were kept in an artificial ice cove. A man went and fed penguins morning and evening .There was a man-made water fall which was highlight of the park. It was very pretty. On our way back from waterfall, we fed some birds with worms which they charged .People who are not much into birds can give it a miss because Singapore has lot more to do!"
"Monday visit to the park on 21st December. Park entrance was beautiful with all the flora and fauna display. Noticed that most of the birds display are have overgrown vegetation. I don't know whether is was meant to be that way as to simulate a wild habitat, but as park visitors we are not able to see birds clearly. Disappointed! If we want to see birds in their wild natural habitat, we can just visit nature reserved to see. Remember that it's a park and we pay good money to see the birds exhibit."
"My wife and I together with my sis in law and niece had a half day outing to this bird park. We have been there many times. It is a good place for family outing. However, I felt this time round, there seems to be less to see. The bird show was very brief. We also did not see visitors feeding the parrots which I found very interesting to do in the previous visits. May be it was because it was drizzling a bit. Visitors should do this and take photos if it is still on."
"Been here a few times. The only sad thing about my last visit is that many places are under renovation so we were not able to visit many of the birds, like the owls, the peacock family.It is best to always bring an umbrella when visiting this place since it's either too warm or it suddenly starts to rain."
there is no point in going to jurong bird park if you will go to malaysia kuala lampur also with singapore because kl bird park is much larger and with a lot of birds variety much more than this bird park also because you are in singapore so the ticket for sure will be much expensive than malaysia. for me i went there and did not enjoy my visit there but enjoyed a lot with both my two visits to kl bird park.
"Its a normal one. We went to the theatre show. It was good but not comparable to others. It,s not at all a rainy day activity"
"While a lovely setting, the park has a lot of thick tree growth which is great for the birds but harder to actually see bird life, particularly near the waterfall area.It is a little way from the city by public transport so allow about an hour if travelling by MRT and the a short bus trip to the bird park.We didn't have long to visit, so staying longer may have made this a better tourist attraction for us. Also coming from Australia and doing many bush walks, we are probably a bit spoilt for seeing bird populations in the wild."
You need to check your own interest and enthusiasm before planning to visit this attraction. Post the attraction i realized that it was not of my interests so i had an average time.
Found the place over rated and expensive. The species of birds were also not many and the tram experience was a drudgery. Bird Show as an attraction was the only saving grace.
"We visited this place with my family. There are a lot of sections with different birds, and it is a good experience to look at different kinds of birds.You can take a walk around the whole park or else if short on time, just take the tram and visit the main areas as well as enjoy the show."
"We caught the MRT TO Boon Lay and bus 194 to Jurong Bird Park. I have been to many parks like this and found this one not too good. It was dirty, slippery in the wet and hardly any birds. Cages needed cleaning as well. It was not worth the effort or expense."
Amongst all the attraction in Singapore if you are running short of time then you can give it a miss. since all the birds are in cage if you are going for a zoo this could be skipped
One can see a variety of colours of birds here. Pretty small park and can be covered in 2-3 hours. Must note the feeding and show timings and plan well.
There is a nice waterfall in the park - birds fly around it freely. Good experience - enjoyed the visit.
"More geared as a children's theme parkThis is my THIRD visit to Jurong Bird Park, over 18 years and I have watched it's slow decline, today I was unimpressed and appauled at some of the psittacines genera enclosures. Some enclosures I felt had too many birds for the size of the enclosure, such as the Lears Macaw with one Macaw having no feathers on its head, was it sick or being plucked by others ? All the same it wasn't a good look. Some psittacine enclosures just had bare minimum of natural enrichment activities, just branches as perches and ropes. The Spix Macaw flight enclosure was what I had expected, many leafed branches, trees and branches, however neither Spix Macaw was visiable and I wondered if they were still actually housed at Jurong anymore, it was a real disappointment not see this magnificent Macaw.There appears to be a significant decline in the actual numbers of psittacine species now housed at the Park, as very few Amazons as to past years, no Quakers, and 4 Caiques amongst others.Many of the parrot enclosures all the birds were clinging to the wire high at the back of their enclosure, obviously not content to perch on the few branches in each enclosure so this was a sad sight.The free flight bird shows, are still highly entertaining, and I applaude the lectures to the crowd on the responsibilities of caring for a parrot and the importance of parrot conservation, the show is a good educational lesson for all.Many people delight in having their picture taken with a Macaw or a large species parrot, but enquiring this is no longer possible, only to be told you can hold a T bar with conures , even thou the designated area for picture opportunity had macaws and cockatoos perched on stands."
"1. ""Flexible"" pricing photo packages which intends to scare foreign visitors offThe below is the conversation I had with the parrots photo booth at the entrance:Me: How much is the photo?Staff: SGD$50 for 1 photo. (while you can have SGD$25 for lunch with parrots, which does not make sense at all)Me: We will not buy it.Your staff: What about 50% off. SGD$25 for 1 photo.Me: We will not buy it.Your staff: LAST CHANCE. SGD$20 for 1 PHOTO.We then walked away. Quoting an outrageous price SGD $50 for 1 photo?Discount offered? That means the price quoted is not fixed and you can bargain with the price?Is it a park owned business or privately operated business at Jurong Bird Park?Such method of price quotation really deter tourists from having enjoyable moments at the park.2. Poor staff training and miscommunication among staffBefore I made my visit to Jurong Bird Park, I have asked the staff whether it is possible to redeem the Lunch with Parrots with the iVenture cards. The reply I received is positive and clearly stating that I can redeem at the restaurants. However, the staff at the restaurant have no idea what I am talking about when I made the visit. The staff even consulted with his boss and the result is still remains negative. That differs from what just said by your CS staff via email. What a disappointing experience which leads to financial loss to my own!"
"Was total unimpressed with this venue. The park looked tired, I had expected to see a huge netted aviary with an amazing array of birds flying freely as advertised but instead saw too many birds confined in small cages. It was sad to see some of the Condors and large birds of prey in small cages. The only decent things was the tropical bird show."
"The visit in Jurong bird park was disappointing. First , the entrance ticket price is very high. Then ,each bottle of water you buy is very expensive (and in hot humid Singapore you must buy one or two).The place itself is designed mainly for young children. Like any zoo, the poor birds look miserable in their cages, unable to fly anywhere. I did not enjoy this place."
I have done a lot of travelling and sight seeing with my kids and I bought the 4 parks in 1 Singapore Zoo deal. We headed to the bird park on the first afternoon. (Didn't realise it was so far).It came to rain but we still wondered around the whole place.If I'm honest I think the pace is really run down and not worth a visit. Birds didn't look great and especially the avary part where peacocks roam freely etc. The place was filthy. Yes birds are messy but when there are cafes near by etc it was full of poo and just felt old.To top it off o sent my kids to buy bird food. Advertises $2. My son came back with 2 and no change. The guys don't have change here be warned and stick the whole lot into a donation box. So it's not actually $2 it was $5. Which isn't a lot but isn't the point and actually a lot for bird liquid they barely touch !Sorry bird park I'm not wowed and it doesn't take a lot to please me !
Perhaps the birds are in the midst of transiting to the new combined sanctuary with Mandai. So many cages are emptied. Lesser Birds are in the free flying enclosures.
"I approach the Usher and ask how to purchase ticket online. After I done, she told me to get the ticket from the ticket counter which I had q up for 15min till my turn, then the counter staff said actually not necessary to q, as the ticket is in my email. If the asher had inform me earlier, my family and I would not be wasted our good 15 min for nothing... I feel very frustrated and the weather was so hot at that time...."
"Don't know where to start and where to end, maps looks easy but not easy to follow. Tend to miss out few places and its very far apart. Overall nothing much to be impress or to come back."
"Extremely hot! not fantastic at all. very very hot! no water sprinkle, or big fan along route n at show area. photoshooting services is lousy, only give small size soft copy i will not return with my kids, not recommended to friend"
"It s my 4th time and I was disappointed ...I really like this park and I was happy to come back ...Compare to the other times many birds were missing ...and my favourite part, the parrot area, is closed for a month !Why not advising guests at the entrance ?I would have been away ...That s not fair ...."
"Straight from the seventies, here is a structure far away from downtown where many birds are invisible lost in the trees and others are like chicken in the yard. Some areas (like penguins) are simply very sad.Have theater lenses for watching and magnification if you want to take meaningful pictures."
"This is just a general observation during my visit to the bird park.The caged parrots in the parrots section looked very sad. A few of them stuck to the cage sides. Couple of birds tried to reach the visitors as if trying to get out either that or feeling bored.Being caged is not natural and parrots are highly fun-loving social creathres.And they need much fly time out in the sky freely.While the female staff minded how the parrot tried to interact with the visitor. Please don't forget to care for the well being of the birds that are caged first, protecting them from physical interaction from visitors second.If you want visitors to stay away from the birds. Please place them in the waterfall section don't caged them to see. Place them in waterfall section to roam freely that is the second best option.In that way they have a choice not to interact with visitors. Remember staff are not a bird prison guard.Get your priority right from the start."
"The park is a long way from the metro station, so would recommend taking a taxi there. As we talked for along time before we got to the park and I would buy tickets in advance.The park in not very large and I was accepting different Birds but they seemed the same."
"There really isn't much variation of birds in Jurong Bird Park. The shows are just average. Other than the shows, there really is nothing but boredom."
Not worth the money. We lived in Singapore 14 years ago and the bird park was fantastic then. We visited in June 2018 and it was very shabby. Run down and not cared for. Hardly any birds. Many cages empty. Compared to other attractions in Singapore this is at the bottom of the list. Very disappointed.
The park really needs a makeover. As I walked along the premises to view the exhibits I can't help but notice that everything looks old and unappealing to the eyes. I am greeted mostly by the unwelcoming smell of bird stench. Its understandable to have the smell but perhaps it could be kept in check by regular cleaning?The water in which the birds are frolicking in seems dirty. E.g the penguins and flamingos. The washroom also needs some maintenance. The taps are not working well. I had to keep pressing on in order to wash my hands.
High flyers show was not as earlier. Big disappointmentHawk show was ok okBirds were fewTake your call and skip Incase time is short
"Overall was good, except there is no local food in the park. Should have promote local food as it is a tourist attraction."
Spoiled by the Rain... Could not enjoy as per expected.Tram service refused to take wheelchair due to rain. Could not really bring around old parents as per wished. Food is a way too expensive.The show is ok though. Again could not catch all the shows due to heavy rain which limited our mobility with my old parents and young kids. The bad weather to blamed and not the Park Authority entirely...!
Whole place feels run down. Could not see much on the tram ride. Cages are rusty.Jurong Bird Park needs a big refurbish job to catch up with its peers like Singapore Zoo and River Safari.
"avoid if you can. no more sky train, road tram is not good lots of waiting and lots to walk. and shows also not that great"
I went with my family and some close friends.We were all greatly surprised by the lack of wheelchair accessibility.I am assuming that the new location once the Bird Park is moved will be much better in this regard.
"I love birds and really went out of my way to go here. What a letdown. The only exhibits worth seeing are the waterfall pavillion and the lorry loft because birds have somewhat of a natural environment to fly around and be free. The larger birds like hawks, hornbills, parrot exhibits almost made me cry. It was horrendous. Miserable birds in small pens. No toys or stimulation or anything to engage with. Such smart intelligent birds kept that way really put me off this place. Parrots and Macaws like to live in the treetops not so low down. Everywhere you looked there were birds hanging off the tops of cages as if to want to escape. The whole Disneyland train thing was a bit much even though it helped with the heat the prerecorded messages were smarmy. Too many loud noisy tourists allowed in the park at once. Can you go anywhere in Asia withour animals/birds being treated like a freakshow? They are razing their nature to the ground to build up their cities thus destroying the natural world so they can put their wildlife in cages. It's super depressing. Was really expecting more natural conditions for them. Less stupid man made pretend tree light shows and more money to preserve your real treasures - nature and wildlife please."
"Was very disappointed with the Peter rabbit egg hunt this year comparing with last year's Smurf theme. As we went specially for that, it was totally not worth it. Otherwise the birds are alright."
"We visited Jurong bird park only because we bought 4-park admission tickets (3-park is not available). Should we spend $30 to visit this, we would have been very disappointed. Location is quite far from city, we caught Uber because it is far from MRT, you need to catch bus.The park is old and rundown, looks like the birds and cages were not properly taken care. The water sections (flamingo, pelican and swan) are dirty. King of the Skies show was not impressive. Not worth the time and money.The only thing good is the penguins. Plenty of penguins, I really enjoyed watching penguins."
Lots of people as it was Sunday and it was difficult to find things.Many birds were caged and everything looked unnatural.Not enough space to sit or rest.when I went for the bird show it was already finished.So its best not to visit the park on public holidays
There are quite a limited number of bird species as far as I can remember after the trip just today.And some like the birds of paradise depends on your luck on spotting them.Clear views of toucans and hornbills. Can't remember much about eagles or owls. Far off from town.Suggest to visit zoo rather than bird park unless u are in Singapore for a week or more and have time to spare!Quite boring for me after I've been to the zoo. Zoo is definitely more interesting.
I did not like this place at all. While they had an interesting array of birds they did not look happy and amny cages seemed far too small for the size and number of birds.The food here is absolutely disgusting and to be avoided at all times.The place was clean - no rubbish around and well signposted. I just felt sorry for the birds!
"I had other good memory about this place since I was actually often here when I was living in Singapore before as 'Expat'. Soon after got our ticket, the lady told me that the parrot I love, died already. Was a clever one. She told me the trainer can't teach the new parrot like the one before. It was a special one."
"The conditions the birds have to put up with are not good at all. Cages are very small, some of the larger birds can hardly ever move around. Jurong Bird Prison would be a more suitable name for some of what you see. As for the visitor experience, the park is very commercialized. More often than not it feels like it's all about selling food, drinks, and other trinkets, while the birds are just a sideshow, and when you want to leave, you discover the only way out is to walk through a gift shop and a restaurant, as there is no other exit. Still, at least you as a visitor can eventually get out of this tourist trap, while the birds don't have this luxury. On the upside, all the staff were friendly, and the labels are interestingly written in good English. The birds themselves are magnificent but the area of the park is too small to host so many species, which is especially noticeable with the larger birds of prey, and some of the toucans."
"Paid $100+ for 2 adults, 1child & 2 Snrs and it didn't felt worth it.1. Kids were there for the water play area and it was closed for maintenance. No mention when I bought the tickets online, or at least not visible to me. Would not have booked this date.2. Went for parrot & Lory feeding and had photos taken. The person kept asking me to buy the photos. First said $35 for one. And when rejected, he lowered to 2 for $50. And when further rejected, he said 5 for $50. What is the actual price?? My dad did buy finally but That's not the kind of attitude I expect of a kids attraction at SG. If u want to build memories, take the pictures of happy guests who love nature and animals, post them on your Facebook and not just think of making quick bucks.3. Food selection was very limited. Apart from hawk cafe outside (ridiculous pricing) there's nothing much inside. At least zoo had kfc near the kids play area where parents & kids could grab a seat/ quick bite.Birds selection was good and they were pretty but it was a waste that we had to head out of JBP for decent lunch and were not inclined to head back after that."
"The park was a great experience, great shows, nice features, however, we had one bad experience. Near the entrance, visitors can take pictures with parrots and some other birds. The staff member who organizes the photos (Rachel), was literally yelling at my parents because they missed an instruction. My parents aren't native english speakers so they had a bit of trouble understanding what she was saying, but getting yelled at was absolutely not warranted. I hope the staff behavior can improve in the future."
"This place has potential but has ageing infrastructure, is overpriced and very smelly. An abundance of birds but whole flocks of too many of one kind. The penguins are hard to see through dirty glass and most birds are behind thick wire mesh which is hard to see through. The extra costing tram only has 3 stops so not user friendly and should be included in cost of ticket. The highlight of visit is bird show but only shows are 11 and 3 and 4 hours at park is just too long to stay. There is a senior rate which at $13 is reasonable but they only give it to LOCALS...SENIOR IS SENIOR NO MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM...."
"Quite far off and small, nothing great to write about it. Has one or two shows where birds will fly in and out and do some tricks. Though not ethical from a bird lover perspective, but if you park this aside you can spend 2 hours here.Getting out of this place is a nightmare. Taxis are in extreme short supply here. Extremely poorly managed. No direct SMRT connect. Not easy to get to your next destination. So 2 hours to do the park and at least 1 hour waiting to get a taxi!!"
"Expensive for locals. Should have more discounts for Singaporean, Carpark should be free, The Lory park should be more like Langkawai Bird Park.Not going back."
"While the birds are beautiful anywhere as well as here, had the terrible experience at the Flamingoes show where the male staff (apparently Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi) was extremely rude. The american managers of theirs are even more rude and made us move out of the queue, with racial overtones."
Compare the few year ..feel a bit disappointed.lack of bird..not organised.feel boring to visiting
"Bought 4 park pass, but was disappointed by attraction. Seems to be lacking maintenance while they wait for new park to open. Tour buses seem to just concentrate on 2 shows then leave. Lorikeet exhibit was closed so really not much point coming"
This one is not as good as singapore zoo. it would be good to see all the shows where you will be able to see all the birds and enjoy the acts instead of seeing them in their enclosure
The park is currently a little bit further from the centre than most other attractions and is going to be relocated in the next couple of years closer to the zoo. At the moment it is a trip to Jurong East metro then a taxi to the park. I paid for lunch with the birds as did two other families. The food was very poor both in quality and variation. The bird show was nothing that I hadn't seen before and only mildly entertaining. The park seemed a little unloved but perhaps this was because it was being relocated and the staff had lost interest.
"The poor birds, some looked so unkept was quite sad. The poor puffins were in a slimy dirty tank area with so much mildew on the glass window we could hardly see in and that was one of the main reasons for going to the bird park along with the owls - although the owls did seem to be happy and healthy looking! Many of the larger birds out in the open and very hot enclosures where 'hen pecked' and feathers out many had sores on them wasn't pleasant at all. We bought the 4 park pass along with the zoo, so we were quite looking forward to it and were in and out as quick as we could be as seeing the state of some of the birds - just wasn't nice. There didn't even seem staff to be around to even check on any as you would expect. The only heartwarming thing was we saw when we were leaving the park that it was moving in 2020 to the Singapore Zoo - that is the best idea and we will make sure we revisit the Bird Park when it is being looked after under the careful eye of the brilliant Singapore Zoo. Not much I can say except if you do go - don't expect much."
I was expecting more local birds. I have see a lot of these birds and it was a long way to go. If you have never been to a bird park then by all means make the trip. But if you have seen flamingos and ducks and eagles then I don't see a lot of other varieties to make the cost and travel worth it.
This visit reduced me to tears particularly the penguin display (I can't even call it an enclosure) and the owls. The birds looked distressed and the aviaries for the larger birds seemed too restricted. So sad.
This was a huge disappointment. Most of the birds looked stir crazy with not a lot of room to fly around. Smelly and quite dirty surroundings.
"Most of the exhibits were closed or in run down condition. Access to the park itself was very difficult with no signages. The SBS bus driver who drove our bus could not speak a word of english or may be he did not talk to people. Shows were excellent tho. some dead birds were not removed and children were shocked to see them. Feeding the lorries was exciting. But my point is if you are shifting say so, donot take our money."
My children found this park a little boring. There are things to do but I would always prefer Singapore Zoo if you had to make a choice.
"If you've been to Singapore zoo, there is no need to come here.The smells are overpowering and and really not what the kids signed uo for when they said they wanted to go to Singapore."
"This was my second visit and was travelling with kids, I find there were few birds than the last time, shows was also not that great and it has become very pricey. More commercial. Would rather suggest to skip and go to the zoo instead. Not worth it!"
"My wife and I had looked forward to our visit so much, particularly to see the flamingos. However it was very disappointing. The exhibits did not seem well kept and the water seemed quite dirty. In one area there was a dead bird just decomposing in the water. Even some of the birds did not look healthy. The penguin exhibit was the exception and was very good."
"Among all places of interest, this would be one of the most boring and it is located on the west end of island.Not elderly friendly, lots of uphill walk. Even for middle age can be quite tiring. Get a tram instead. The environment itself is not as fascinating. When it's humid. It's even hard to enjoy with limited shade. Suggest this the last choice of your list."
We went after the read up on the website sold it extremely well. We turnt up and it seemed lovely at first. The shows were great but the Rest of the park was a wash out.We paid extra for lunch with the parrots. The show was basically the same as the free one and the food was very limited and not very nice at all.The saving grace was the kids water park.
Felt really sad to see some of the big birds stuck in sad cages...not allowing enough room to spread their wings properly...i think I was comparing it to the fantastic zoo...it does not compare.A very depressing outing and quite far out from everything - have to drive or take a cab!Ill skip it!
The facility has deteriorated since my earlier visit about 10 years ago. Many birds look sick and are put up in small cages.
"We visited this place to get to all activities as per their website, but JBP has nothing except closed enclosures of birds from all over the world. Except the birds there was nothing else to look out for. The whole park can be combed in a hour and travelling 20kms away from the city just for this was not worth. we didn't feel good about this place though. For kids, it could be great though.Lunch with parrots was a sham when left over food/ordered food was just picked up by birds that flew into a dining hall !"
"Ok, not so good and not so bad, two shows everyday morning are very good. Artificial water fall is good."
"Many enclosures have lost their birds and have been filled with other more common species, especially the parrots section, which should be easy for a tropical zoo. The place looks in dire need of investment and some new bird purchases"
"Big disappointment! If you've been in the Kuala Lumpur bird park don't even bother to come here. It's far from the city and less fun! The birds are kept in relative small and crowded cages contrary the other zoos in Singapore. We saw birds trying to fly but were immediately hit themselves on the roof, couldn't even fully stretch their wings in the process. The park itself is big, has a lot breeds a parrot aviary where you can feed lories and a waterfall aviary where some birds can fly freely. But it's a pain to see the others in the little cages. It should be like in KL where a huge park is covered with net and all the birds are free to fly. If you haven't been in the KL Bird Park and have a half day for it, then maybe you can visit it. Otherwise it isn't really recommended."
"This is a very expensive venue and was not for us. There will be those that disagree and say the upkeep of all the birds will justify the admittance fee. Maybe so, but not for me."
We were a bit dissapointed. The place was very far. Not so many birds we could see at that time. Restaurants inside are insanely expensive for what it is (fast food for one menu is aroind sgp 22).
"We felt it was a lot hyped place than real... there was a decent queue for tram and it does not serve much purpose as most of the times we end up walking back to see what came in between. Places was not really clean and stinky at places.It has some good birds and you find lot more birds in other zoo which are not so famous. Overall, I would recommend to go there only if you have spare time."
i thought the Bird Park essentially promotes natural habitat and freedom for birds... not so... almost all birds live in small confined cages... some cages have almost a 100 birds cramped in and the owl enclosure is the size of the back of a pick up.. pitiful.... broke my heart to see the birds like that.. i will never ever pay money to visit and promote that again...
"Been to other "" zoo-like"" parks and this one was disappointing. Most the birds are in cages and hard to see ( from the fast-moving Tram)...Perhaps better if you walk, but I doibt it.Vultures out numbered other birds...except Pelicans and Flamingos...but truly...not worth your precious time, if you're on a limited time schedule...Go to the Botanical Gardens instead."
"Never been so bored visiting an attraction. Nothing special about the place, was just 1 big park as you walk and walk. Nothing worth mentioning and thus a waste of money."
"Not to impressed, stuck out to the west of Singapore in industrial land the bird park did not come even close to the advertising. I just felt they were trying too hard to promote an OK bird park as something special. It is not special - interesting perhaps but IMO not worth the effort to get there,"
"There were few birds than expected, some cages are smelly, and i think there is no need of tram ride to cover the area, so be careful when taking tickets, they are promoting tram ride on admission, i think its a wasting of money, because the area is small and there are few types of birds."
"I am not a big fan of bird parks or zoos, but if you like a bird park that is clean and doesn't torture the birds in captivity do visit this place. Far from the city this place is nice and a refreshing visit esp if u have kids under 10. Food is horribly expensive inside though!"
"The experience as a whole is not too bad. I will begin with the good parts:If you go there in the morning, it is more quiet, (remember to put on some insect repellent spray if you are prone to attract mosquitoes). If you like a bit of walking it is a nice time to be there. We took the tram though. The bird feed near the waterfall was a lot of fun and you can take some close up pictures with them. There is a park for the children to get wet and play. We went for Lunch with Parrot. The lunch part was horrible(see below), the parrot show was very good, educational and entertaining, suitable for children between 4-11.The bad part: I don't know why people will feed chips to the birds. Chips! The snack they sold you from the cafe are meant for you to eat only. If you can run a bird park by feeding chips to bird you can run one in your backyard. Please people.The Lunch with parrot at Songbird terrace: When we arrived the place was closed to everyone. There were already 60-80 people inside, some more were waiting. Around 10 or more empty tables were available so I walked pass the barrier strings to told a male waiter I have a booking.The reply I got was they have no place for me, the main reason being there was a tour group of 200 people strong booked lunch there. If I must have lunch there they will have a place for me, but it will be at least 12:45 or later. The parrot show starts at 1:00 p.m. and we are due to leave at 2:00 p.m.I asked if we will be compensated if we eat elsewhere since we already made full payment for lunch at 12:00. The overbooking was not our fault and I do not understand why our booking was on a lower priority.The answer was no, my money was only good there. I told the male waiter that having 15 minutes for lunch then run to a show is not acceptable. He can either give us a table at noon or not. I showed him my confirmation e-mail from the sales team. He simply ignored the letter and began to question the authenticity of my booking. He wanted me to give him credit card receipt or proof that I paid. The only thing you got by booking online is one e-mail with details of booking and a confirmation number, to which he chose to ignored. If this is truly how booking system works, what is the point of sending me a confirmation e-mail with a 7digit confirmation number?I insisted I have paid and he reluctantly set us a table, screeching chairs and banging tables to show us his displeasure. I made some calls and was reassured that we indeed have paid and was entitled to our seats.The tour guide of the said 200 people tourist groups seem to be acquainted with the male waiter and was pressing him for more tables, I don't know whether there are other deals between them but the waiter was obviously turning down every other customers away from the place to accommodate her tour.When I told the waiter that I have called the sales team to confirmed again that I have paid. He became very defensive and said he was merely trying to tell me they have two types of booking. Now, it really does not matter to me if there are ten types of booking because when I showed him proof of a genuine booking confirmation, he cannot recognize it.When the place is overbooked/double booked, I was given zero prior notice and my booking was thrown away like dirt on the spot. They were simply turning paid customers away without proper explanation and alternative arrangements. If I took the waiter's word for it and went elsewhere, I stand to lose time and money.Now if the 200 people tour did have a booking, and their booking, for some mysterious reasons not disclosed to me, enjoyed a higher priority then mine, they can simply reject my online booking(which was made more than two weeks prior to my visit to the park) or sent me an e-mail to discuss alternative arrangements, they have done neither of that. So I cannot help but think that the tour booking was prioritized for other reasons."
"I last visited the Jurong Bird Park in 2012 and really enjoyed the experience despite not actually being the biggest fan of birds or being a fan of bird in enclosed spaces. This visit was less than pleasant for a number of reasons...Firstly, that great capitalist enterprise Wildlife Reserves Singapore have scored another great point for capitalism. Entry fees are extortionate and food and beverage (they've got you trapped again!) are outrageously overpriced.The park is dirty and not well kept anymore. The sense of lack of care was evident throughout. Attractions are really showing their age. The pelican pool for example was covered in algae and stank as the water was almost completely stagnant.However, true capitalism really came into its own at the entrance way. An opportunity for to have pictures taken with parrots was ruined when a single picture was offered to us at the absolutely eye watering, mouth dropping price of S$70!!!!Until Wildlife Reserve Singapore gets its act in order and rethinks the way it charges people (yes these things should cost money but seriously folks....) tourists should avoid, avoid, avoid!"
We went there once and never came back - it is just in summary not worth the money and time. But thats just our opinion. First and foremost we feel that we were ripped off with the entrance fee and the cost of drinks and food there - for what it has to offer.
Years ago it was wonderful. Today it is nowhere near as good as before. Progress is not always for the bestThe train ride extra cost is not worth the money v
"Some of the large birds are in cages too small, they wouldn't even get the change to have their wings spanned.there are plenty of birds and several shows a day.there is a water park here for kids to play in so take swimmers and towels for the kidsbut try leaving, we waited at the long taxi queue for ages. I went to the service desk and asked they ring several taxi companies to get at least 20 taxi's sent out.even taxi's dropping off people wouldn't collect from the queue and just take offwhen we got a taxi we asked the driver and he said drivers don't come to Jurong and that was pretty obvious from the queue."
"Too overrated for tourists, a good place overall to visit but only if you are a nature lover. Not for people who like to roam around city and shop and dine.The Bird feeding was exciting, the rest of it was OK...not great! The price is not cheap especially if you are visiting in a group/family."
We had been told by friends that the Jurong Bird Park was an excellent place to visit so we were looking forward to it. Maybe we have been spoiled by the Singapore Zoo and we also had my sister there who is from St. Louis with another excellent Zoo but although the variety is great and you could spend a lot of time there we found our time frustrating. Why?First it is not easy to get to or leave. It is quite far from any MRT/train station so you need to take the taxi if you are older and can't walk as far as you used to. Then when your ready to leave you either stand for an hour to get a taxi or call you. If you live in Singapore then great you have a phone but I saw some folks with small children begging to borrow a phone to call a taxi which they finally got help from someone.Second the phamplets and signs at the park are a joke and confusing. We wanted to see the Flamingo feeding so we waited at the Flamingo lake and nothing happened then looked closer and it said Flamingo pool which was another place.Third the cages of many of the birds were so dark and dense mesh it was hard to see the birds or get good pictures.There were highlights of couse and i am sure the shows were good but we missed to timing. The Lorry section was great.All in all a disappointing day. I hear they are going to combine the Bird park with the Zoo and I think that will really up the attraction. So I would suggest visitng other attractions in Singapore if you have limited time. That is unless you are an avid bird watcher.
"Primarily meant for kids and not adults, only adults can skip the same. It is very well developed, managed and maintained bird park but there is nothing much natural there. There are variety of birds from across continents but majority of them are caged. There are shows that are conducted and really well trained birds that display stunts for one to enjoy but not for someone who has seen them in their natural habitat. Birds are to be enjoyed in natural habitat where one can has to put efforts to sight them and get to learn their natural ways, that is real learning. This is more for small kids to enable them to see the birds live instead of books, if that is not the purpose can be avoided. Thumbs down to the park as per me. Our conference planner definitely made the wrong choice of the place for us to visit on the City Tour."
"I'm not quite sure what I imagined this would be like - but I certainly didn't think this would be as depressing as it was. In the main, a very old fashioned style of exhibiting the wildlife. Depressing cages and landscaping. I understand the Singapore Zoo is a much more uplifting experience."
I visited this attraction 20yrs earlier. Now returning with my daughter i found it a little tired and in need of a revamp. I'm not sure if i would rush back for a third visit.
"When I travelled in 2001 and again in 2007, highlight of my trip was visit to this place. But when I visited last, it gave a worn down look. Sill the flagship show of birds was interesting to watch. But the facility has really gone down and looked short on maintenance."
I had a poor experience because there is nothing fun to see there except seeing the same birds non-stopMaybe u could:add a few rides like a bird ride to make it more interesting
"I've raised Eclectus parrots and lorikeets, and as someone excited to see the world's biggest bird park I was absolutely mortified to see Eclectus parrots at the Lorikeet cafe. Why? Well, both species of parrot have incredibly different food needs. Due to an abnormally long gut Eclectus need primarily fruit diets whilst Lorikeets often struggle eating solid food so eat nectar only usually.Tourists were being given cups of nectar formula and being encouraged to feed it to both species of parrots. That's not healthy in the slightest and quite worrying for such a well-known bird park."
"Not a lot of opportunity for interaction with birds here. Most birds are in cages so you hardly see them flying around freely. Like the title of this review says, the one in Kuala Lumpur is much better"
"if you run out of options, bird park is the place to be. nothing special, nothing spectacular. for adults, very boring. for kids soso"
"Like the plumage on a 1970s Norwegian Blue, this bird park is tired and in desperate need of a major revamp.Other than adding more and more concrete, not much has been done to the bird park in 20 years. Once one of the top tourist destinations in Singapore, a modernisation is at least ten years overdue. The birds are still in too-small cages - something which may have been OK in the 1980s is not acceptable now. An apt metaphor for Singapore's development.You should check showtimes for the main show and the raptors before planning your trip.Getting their is a MRT/bus combination that could take an hour from the city. Worth researching well before you decide on your trip."
"I visited with my wife and my sister-in-law. Both of them felt pity towards those birds in the tiny cages.For me, I feel very sorry for the parrot ""Amigo"", I have seen him singing and serving the park since 2001. Every time I saw him at the amphitheater show and heard him singing with shaky voice, I feel very pity. In addition to that, I saw two Macaws hanging at the cage net and looking outside with very pitiful faces. I can understand that they want freedom. When we saw the egret opening mouth towards the artificial tide and looking for the fish repeatedly, we decided to leave the park.Anyway, this place is good for local kids to learn about different species of birds. I wish the park management should think about better living condition for the birds."
"our trip to Jurong Bird Park started from City Hall MRT. Upon arrival at Boon xxx MRT we saw no obvious information on how to reach the Park. Information along the way on how to reach the Bird Park is not obviously displayed. Non-English speaking visitors would have problems. Upon stepping off the bus at the Park there is no information as to the park location. It is very close by, but again, there is no welcoming information. A walk from the bus stop to the Park entrance on a rainy day would 'dampen' the spirits of many visitors. Too many birds are imprisoned in cages that are protected with a wire mesh that also prevents the visitors from photographing the 'inmates'. Birds SHOULD NOT be kept in such enclosures. The three 'attractions' that justify some reason for holding birds in captivity are: the penguin/flamingo area, the walk-in aviary and the 'bird show', which was very entertaining and offered some educational value to advanced English language speakers. One 'bird' you should avoid is the 'Chicken Biriyani' in the restaurants close to the entrance. It was disgusting! A visit to Jurong Bird Park should be low in your places to see."
A must visit Bird Park as it offers you great varieties of birds that are taken care of by the Park very well.The orangy and pink Pelicans are a wonderful sight and it brings a great smile when you see them.All categories of birds are classified in separate cages.My most favourite is the 5th level whereby the birds at the Lory Loft is presented with a net above as they are let loose and for a fee of S$2 you can purchase a honey syrup cup whereby you are allowed to feed the birds and it is a great photoshoot.Watch out for their performing times as the raptors will be flying above you from the command of their trainers. Awesome!
This place is ok if you like to see exotic birds in cages that are way too small and in need of replacement.Didn't like it much at all.
"The park itself is great with plenty to occupy both kids and adults for a good full day. My major grouse is the F&B options are limited, expensive and low quality, which pretty much spoiled our day. Not expecting gourmet food but $7.90 (SGD) for a hot dog in a bun is a rip off..as is microwave bowl of pasta with a few slices of sausage and tomato paste on top for $11-12 (SGD) and waffle with ice cream for $17 (SGD). Worse of all, there were only two miserable hotdogs left at 1 p.m. to feed my family of 4! What a shame to spoil the visitor experience this way!"
"I and my daughter were visiting Singa for 3 days. We had to choose among the several offers on what to do in the city. Unfortunately, we picked this park to go in one of the afternoons. They advertise in their website that the last ticket time is sold at 5:30PM, so we planned to go on the touristic bus in the morning, have lunch and than go on to Jurong in the afternoon. We arrived at the park at 4:30. No one ever told us that the performances (shows with the birds) end up between 2:30 and 4 PM daily. We paid full price - they do not offer a discount for afternoon comers - and we did not see any show whatsoever. Most of their performances with the birds are between 10 AM and 2:30 PM. Only one of them end at 4 PM. So, we got in and started being pushed by the employees that kept saying for us to take the tram asap as the park was getting ready to be closed. Why do you guys sell tickets after 2 PM than - I asked the manager who stood there without any answer. Why don't you guys inform people about the timing of the shows or maybe give them half a price tkts for those getting in after 2:30? He was unable to answer these questions and did not offer anything to make up for our loss.Therefore, I advise you, if you decide to go, make sure you do it in the morning. If you can not go in the morning, DO NOT GO! Don't spend expensive dollars to not be able to see every attraction, or have to see it fast because the employees are pushing you saying they will close soon. For me, this was what we usually call a ripoff. Other than that, nothing special apart from the parrots that can be fed by food you can buy there.Better use of our dollars!"
The birds are in small cages. Some of them had bleeding scrapes and scars on them.I wasn't impressed with this tourist place but it was another thing that was included in our i-venture card.
"I had hoped that most of the birds would be in large aviaries. Whilst there were certainly some of these, they were mainly set up with cafÃ©s included. I found the sections with hornbills, birds of paradise, penguins and flamingoes depressing. The penguins in particular. Would not recommend to other wildlife enthusiasts. Ok if you want to entertain the kids."
"This is a deplorable old-fashioned park where birds are kept in the least acceptable types of enclosures. It needs to be closed. Unfortunately, western tourists pour through the gates to get photographed with exotic species, believing they are interacting with wildlife.They aren't.There is one magnificent exception to this - the waterfall aviary. This is spectacular, and provides a real environment for many species to flourish in.Note: Jurong is one of the few places in SG to force you to buy water. They have made sure to keep drinking fountains to a minimum. Be wary as they charge a premium."
"Birds are mostly caged. Lorry loft was nice. If you have already seen lot of different parrots and pelicans some where else, you can give this place a miss. If you come here then please don't miss the High Flyers Show. The show was not very spectacular but if you are in the park you should not miss it. We visited the entire place within 3.5 hours by walk. Nearest MRT is Boon Lay and you can take a bus from there to bird park. It took us 50 minutes to reach bird park from Farrer Park MRT using MRT and bus."
"Recently visited Jurong Bird Park, travelled by Taxi from East coast cost 20 which is very reasonable. Bird park is old and needs a makeover, plants in some areas over grown unable to see birds if they were there. Lorries feeding and nursery was the highlight but the rest was very average. Food at Congo was excellent."
I was here 20 years ago and loved it. There were orangutans which were really fun. Now the place seems tired. Even the monorail is not working. Staff are still friendly and helpful. It is time for more birds and add some reptiles or an extreme makeover. It's a long way out and precious time can be better spent around Marina Bay and the gardens.
Visited somewhere in June 2012.Too humid.....Well maintained...There is one show of birds.... quite good.... but couldn't enjoy as it was too hot 7 humid...If you really want to spend time.... go somewhere else....
"I have been to this attraction in 2002 as well, but the experience during this May visit was not good. The Monorail has been taken off but they have introduced a tram.The birds were far less and the bird shows were not at all exciting. The Eagles and vulture show was more of a catwalk kind of show.. showing this is this and that is that. and was over in 10-12 minutes. Earlier in 2002 it was , I remember for about half an hour."
"Actually this is a nice place for family recreation, especially if U have kid(s). If You come from central city of Singapore, you eill feel that this place is very far, takes arround 1 hour. And this place need more variety of birds, since it is on Asia, this place must shows much Asia variety of birds."
"Want to see Large Eagles in small cages or Great Owls, alone, in a dark, small room?This is not tolerable and I am saddened that I fell for the attraction !This park needs to reconsider their strategy.Agreed that the main attractions are being well looked after, thus a 2 star rating, but I would suggest you take your money elsewhere if you are in Singapore !"
"It was better distance then the zoo, but there were not much visitor here!Great view but not much attraction here!You'll just walking around and you'll get a lot of knowledge about bird and bird and more bird!Because there was a lot of big tree there, so the air was fresh"
"This park was a disappointment as there wasnot very many colourful birds to seein the aviaries, the fancy colour parrots, tucans etc. Were all in enclosed cages behind the bars so that cannot even get good photos.Would say tat this is not worth the go if youhave been in some other bird parks before."
Visited few times and went again. still the same old. nothing has changed. good they added water pay park but closed due to covid
"I went to the Bird Park yesterday. Was so happy for the promotion of $2.50 given by them. My family choose a slot at 2pm.I have been to Bird Park a few times and it was great back then.Now, it was like a scam. Most of the exhibition there got this entry fee of $2.50. The water fall, the penguin, the show. Oh my......It is kind of stupid to do this, luring people to come and then have to pay for the $2.50 each time. The water play is also close.We were disappointed and left within 2 hours. What a waste of time and travel time. LOUSY."
Visited during the $2.50 Jan promotion which seemed great but what they don't tell you is almost every section is an additional $2.50! Seems like there would be a much better way of doing a promotion without feeling ripped off. Until birds of play is open it's not really worth it for a toddler.
"A long trek to get here, the park itself is very boring. Not a lot to look at. No places to eat near by and too expensive for what it is. Don't bother wasting your time and money."
"The exhibits are so poorly designed and maintained.Birds look sick, ponds and lakes filthy and smell"
"Direction instruction bad and confusing. Exhibits inadequate,nothing much to excite. No eagles display. Lousy experience. Carpark small. Lack of proper instructions and road marshal at entrance to advise patrons that they can park in a different location. Road marshal just standing there I thought they were some restaurant helper. Not worth the money"
Jurong bird park is a beautiful place but in terms of the employee of the tram they are the worst they people shout at customer if we ask them what we have to do at the stops and they don't even guide there visitors the worst place in customer satisfaction is jurong park.
We had 4 adults visiting this park honestly can say we were all a little disappointed with this visit I found the zoo to offer just as good. The bird show was about the best part.
"My visit to Jurong Bird Park was not a pleasant one. I was hoping it would be more like a bird santcuary than a zoo, and thus my expectations may have been a bit off, but it was very zoo like with enclosures that were not clean, were overcrowded, and smelly, especially the penguin exhibit which was full of algae. I left after only 30 minutes after realizing the park would not get any better. I would not visit again and would not recommend for others to visit either."
"When buying a pass for all 4 parks no one mentions that the Bird Park is located so far away, that even if you finish with the Zoo and River park (which is easy) by 2-3 p.m. and wait until 7-8 pm to start the Night Safari, the park staff reccomends getting there the other day as you wont be able to get there and return in time (due to long distance and traffic). Such a shame!!"
Really disappointed with the park yes it have allot of birds but nothing is worth it but the show's and if u miss the show u miss everything not worth the walk and even tho my kids live animals specially birds they got bored.
"As title above, I brought my families which from China and they found that it was too expensive and boring. We went at noon and waited for the events to start, but the trams does not stop at the places where event played. So we need to walk. We paid for the tram and we still need to walk to the play event."
"Very disappointed and all birds been feed and we don't have a chance to wait for the birds to come near us. Worst is raining and all birds is not around to view much. Anyway, we won't go again."
"Not what I expected, I felt so sorry for the birds in the small cages, they should be allowed to fly around not just hop from branch to branch especially the larger birds. Most of the birds seemed to be struggling to breath with the humidity and couldn't see any water for them, I love animals and I left feeling very depressed as I couldn't help them. If you want to display these birds please let them fly more freely in a lot larger enclosures. Also the the water birds were in very dirty water"
"It is just a below average park with lot of hype created around it, very very far from city centre and extremely expensive for what it actually offers. Would not at all recommend to my family and friends."
"Over priced in entrance fee, food. Not worth the money. You should consider a lower entrance fee. Way too expensive!"
The flamingo water fountain zone is badly maintained and look very dirty. The benches at the kid water play zone is dirty and not cleaned. The air con glass door at the kid water play zone near the eatery is faulty and knock against another glass door panel. you wonder when it will crash.
"Been to Birdpark over 15 years back. Today I brought my wife who has never been there. The exhibits are the same. The variety is so few. This is an ok place for people who have never seen birds like if you stay in a city or desert. Many species are lacking such as birds of paradise, kiwi, terns, turaco, bee-eater, peacocks, etc. A complete waste of time. Even for eagles there are so many varieties & species that we only saw 2 types lol. Not worth the $28 entrance fee. The tram ride is an extra $5 but you can take it inside going to the exit for free. The drinks are over-priced. The waterfall is fake with no birds. The birds are lifeless & zombie-like. Don't waste your time going to a far our place like Jurong. The CEO should be fired. Better off riding a bicycle at Gardens by the Bay ...."
"I visited Jurong bird park on 23.04.2017. Overall it was good trip. However, I Could not found places for children's encounter with Birds as shown in advertisements everywhere? My kids were so disappointed. Photographers were charging 25SGD for one photo involving contact with birds. Also person at children's water play park did not allowed my daughter to play since she dint had proper swimsuit and other children were playing without swimsuit. where the rule for requirement of swimsuit is it written in the ticket?"
yes rain and thunder is an act of god. But poor staff handling isn't. no real explanations given. luckily we demanded refund bcos it wasn't offered freely. park is a fantastic attraction when weather permits but don't bother if weather is no good as a lot of walking involved and uncovered attractions
very less birds. Surrounds with bad smell and not maintained well. no food joints nearby. and pizza hut is there inside but its very bad.
"This must be the lone attraction/joint amongst my circa 90 reviews thus far to receive 1 star.Several reasons contributed to this rating:a. The place is squalid, and a lot needs to be done to 'improve' the cleanliness- not just the environs, but also the cages where the poor birds thriveb. We purchased tickets with tram, and hopped on a tram which stopped as a result of a technical failure. This was further exacerbated by the fact that we were refused boarding to hop on another tram.c. Most of the caged birds were truly 'distressed'- hope someone does take notice !Overall, we were terribly disappointed and consider the Singapore Zoo a better choice !"
"About 10 years ago this was a very well maintained park. But when I went there this time (2016), I was extremely disappointed. Still it is an nice experience to go into this huge bird cages and to feed the parrots. But all other installations and cages are way too small, run-down and dirty. There was a larger lake that became a stinky green swamp with a way too large crowd of Flamingos. Many cages are empty and nearly all cages are too small and dirty. It is unbearable to see the beautiful Aras, Parrots and the large birds of pray being kept in this small cages. Without going into the critical issue of zoological parks, this park particular became unacceptable. I strongly advocate not to visit the park and not to support this abuse of birds with buying a ticket."
"They took my booking for a Lunch with Parrots. They closed it down for renovation without informing. They did not even refund. They converted it into a parrot show - like one of the free shows. and a separate buffet lunch. The food looked really bad. When we got to the lunch, it was closed.Also very limited eating options there. Found a burger place there but nothing beg. Vegetarians carry your own food."
Don't good there it's no worth it waste of time the place is not organized and there no birds to touch or to take a photo only few
"Needlessly, outrageously expensive. Ok, I paid $80 online which is a bit cheaper, for 3 adults. Considering it is Singapore, that is par for the course I guess. But paying $60 in the Bongo Restaurant for an order of chicken nuggets, 2 orders of chicken wings and 3 ice filled drinks is over the top. Seriously, $20 fast food burger meals? Typical Singapore gouging."
"Not having been here for more than thirty years, we really wanted to revisit the birds. Using the Singapore Concierge Map as a guide, we dutifully took the long ride to the end of the line, AS SUGGESTED ON THE MAP. The problem is that you can't get there from there. Attempts to take taxis were futile."
"These people need to take lessons at a well managed park! Ridiculous and unnecessary queue just to buy a ticket. 3 people working, 1 cash register in operation for the usual ticket buying family. They'd then spend endless time acting as an info center while the queue grew out to the street!Inside it's just as bad with insufficient trams running. Plan to wait....Birds and some of the exhibits are of course nice to see.Doesn't have to be like this and it's time JBP gets like the rest of Singapore and puts some planning in place!"
"We visited on the 26th of November 2015. It cost $28 each to enter. We upgraded our entry to include the train ride around the park, this cost $33 each. I thought this was a lot of money but gave it a go anyway. Top tip of the day- train ride a waste of money! Jumped on the train, got to the next station and then was told that it was terminating. Walked up to the next stop but found that there was that many people waiting, we would've been lucky to get on the 2nd train to arrive. We were told walking the park in total would be 1.7km and that's what we did in the end. The variety of birds were disappointing - Pelicans are beautiful birds but are very common. Saw the flamingoes, saw the bird breeding program, a couple of bird enclosures and these were ok. We saw the end of the bird show and again I would rate it as just ok. Just found this park lacked variety, was too expensive and was overrated."
"So excited when I heard it's a bird park. Came all the way to see the big long dark birds with tropical jungle exoticism. All the birds turned out to be either small Malaysian birds, or dead birds, or dying birds. Not interesting."
"I try to find the positive in most things, but I have to say I hated this place. Huge Eagles in tiny glass cages slightly larger than their wing span, made me so sad that every other collection of birds felt wrong. Maybe it has changed in the past year, as everyone else seems to love it."
I feel sorry for the huge birds that are caged up and don't even have place to move around. The entry fees is so high and i dont see any comfort offered to the birds who reside here. Poor owls are put in glass cubicles which is just 300sqft. This place is terrible.
I hated this. Absolutely hated it. Birds need horizontal space to fly as well as vertical. It broke my heart to see birds with huge wing spans crowded into small aviaries. I will never go again.
My husband had a hot dog in one of the restaurants that was disgusting. The bread was sticky and the hot dog tasted of... well dog actually!
"No doubt it was very big park but sadly couldn't spot that many birds. Won't recommend this place if you are travelling with kids or elderly people coz you have to walk too much as all the species are scattered. To mention few there were Flamingos, ostrich, penguins, eagles, vultures, hawks, colorful parrots, Ducks, swans, and a few more. Also, I didn't find anything new there as I have been to ""safari world, Bangkok"" which was way better than this. Something that disappointed me the most were the shows, I expected birds will perform some tricks or will entertain us but they just brought birds and shared some details about a few birds which was too boring... for me it was waste of time !"
"Some one stolen my bag when i sit for Bird Fly show. I lost my money, my keys and cards. I am writing to share for visitor, who have to take their stocks carefully. I dont want see there any."
So many beautiful crammed in small cages and over populated community cages.Over priced and bad quality food.
"Smelly, dirty, small cages for beautiful birds. Very sad to see unhappy Galahs (but pleased to see someone get bitten by one of them who was being teased). Extremely busy in holiday times."
"I went to Jurong Bird Park in Singapore on 26 September with my wife and 3 kids. We arrived at 1130hr local time and had lunch in the restaurant. The restaurant is unique in the way that all the seats are all made of metal made into different kinds of animal figures. We entered the attraction at 1215hr and took some pictures and went to see a show. The show started at 1230hr and finished at 1300hr. We, then, went around the park and did not enjoy it at all. This is because the attraction is very not family friendly, especially for me who brought along 2 baby trollies. There are too many flight of stairs need to be taken to view the attraction close range. Although there are ramp at some of the attraction, it is not designed well in the sense that after going through the attraction, as we are going to exit, there will be another flight of stairs to negotiate. In the end, we will have to exit from where we enter. And the contour of the landscape in not friendly to us who will be pushing the trollies around the park as we need to walk uphill at one part of the park. I saw a lot of other tourist who will carry the trollies up and down to stairs, just like I did. In the end, we left the park at 1330hr which speaks volume as to how much we did not enjoy the outing."
A really fascinating day out. We didn't get to see the whole thing so we will be going back. Lots of insight in to Singapore's history
"Visited for the exhibition on Pandemic and Truly Home. A good experience to walk through the short but rich history of Singapore. Love the effort to include real life accounts and engaging locals to interviews for a perspective from their point of view. How people in different walks of life came through the tumultuous times of Singapore's past and most recently the Covid-19 pandemic. Manage to see some real artefacts from the history, part of my growing up years and things that we won't ever go back to again. Can only reminiscence.."
Really one of the best museums in singapore due to the extensive research and collections for Singaporeans to connect with our short but rich history.Helps us understand lee kuan yew and the earlier years in Singapore.
we both like museums and this one was worth a visit. loads of information about the island pre and post independence
"If you wish to learn more about the history of Singapore, then this is a must visit place! Start with a visit at the Glass Rotunda at level 2, from there you will be connected to Singapore History Gallery. Do spent at least 3 hrs for a in-depth understanding of Singapore history from the 14th century to present day."
"Public areas are spacious and full of modern art design. The galleries are well structured and very informative with stories, pictures, objects and multimedia illustrations. Cafe was luminous, quiet, cosy (with aircon), perfect for a peaceful afternoon tea, with a good book."
"It was amazing. Me and my friends had lots of fun. We had learned a lot from the exhibitions. The staff were very friendly and nice also. Other than that, there were really cool and artsy background to take photos! Worth a visit!! 10/10"
I am not your typical ''musuems'' person but was recommended this by a friend who lives in Singapore and did visit for a couple of hours and frankly would recommend to anyone who is interested in history and culture.
"We visited during the COVID-19 outbreak so I'm sure there were far fewer visitors than usual which made it a very relaxing and pleasant experience for those of us who were there. The different galleries in the museum are very well laid out and, having been to the Battlebox and learnt about Singapore during the Second World War after the surrender to Japan, we found the gallery dedicated to this period added to the experience. I think we probably visited the attractions in the correct order as we knew a lot of the facts before we saw many of the artefacts of the period that were on display..Another gallery centred on colonial times with many relevant items of clothing, photos and other reminders of the period. A must see area of the museum is The Story Of the Forest- a gently curving stair that leads from the first floor down to the ground floor illustrated with three-dimensional animations of the flora and fauna of the forest . At the time we visited, we were the only people walking down and it was an absolutely fantastic experience. We could probably have spent more time looking around if we were able to but with so much to see, choose which galleries interest you and concentrate on those if you have limited time. All the staff we came across were extremely kind, helpful and knowledgeable."
"The amazing thing about Singapore is that despite the multiple ethnicities in the city / country, it is a true melting pot. Other countries have a LOT to learn from Singaporeans and how they have joined forces and become one identity!"
"We had the good fortune to visit during the special interactive display of Singapore's history. The tickets were incredibly reasonable although we opted to see everything. The building itself is an architectural masterpiece and we felt honoured to walk about in it.The staff are attentive and helpful but not a bit restricting or ""watchful"". The special display was amazing beyond belief...the interactive set-up made one feel like one had gone back in time and were travelling forward with the island. After spending several hours on this alone, we refreshed ourselves at the excellent in-house cafe and then proceeded to view the rest of the museum's offerings. So absorbed were we, that we forgot the passage of time and emerged after 6 hours. I could do it all over again and highly recommend a visit!"
"This fantastic exhibition traces the story of Singapore and the Straits of Malacca from circa 1600 to 1850.A wide variety of exhibits, from maps and prints to treasure and cannons, have been brought together from around the world.I think both adults and children could enjoy and learn from a visit."
"This is an amazing museum all about Singapore from pre-colonial time through the eras of the colonial powers and finally to the present day. I can see the enthusiasm in which the curators lovingly put together the exhibits. The information is excellent, especially in the use of personal testimonies through audio recordings and videos.The Singapore History Gallery has some very high quality exhibits and a fantastic mock up of the quarterdeck of a ship. My personal favourite section was the Surviving Syonan which documents life and stories of the Japanese occupation. It really gives you an appreciation of how hard life was back then and just how good life is in Singapore. Another favourite is the Story of the Forest video exhibition. Children will love that one.I was only planning for 3 hours here, but ended up for 5. This museum is one of the best things to see in Singapore."
"fA brilliant museum to get to know the history of Singapore - a trading place before the Europeans, part of the British Imperium, Japanese occupation and independence. A great overview of Singapore's history. Attached to a great cafe."
You should put aside a few hours to visit this very interesting museum which is extremely well presented and laid out.The history of Singapore is very clearly shown by professional exhibits that Are easy to follow and understand.Be sure to spend some time here.
I adore this museum lots and seriously everything is indeed beautiful here and try to take a picture like this picture and omg even the building makes my picture looks more beautiful. Highly recommend!
"It is very inexpensive and I spent over three hours there but there is much to see. Different art forms (paintings, sculptures, modern works), even the setting is worth seeing as it used to be the court house."
"Thoroughly enjoyed my visit to the National Museum of Singapore. Really interesting to follow Singapore's journey from ""birth"" to the current day. I seemed to get a bit lost on occasion and wondered if I was following the correct route through but just meanmered through quite happily. Very informative!"
You need a good day to discover this fascinating history of Singapore. I learned so much about its short history.
"The National Museum of Singapore is a MUST, even for those that might find museums boring. This building is full of exhibits and history that one has to be immersed. It was indeed a great experience."
"A beautiful museum experience. National Museum of Singapore is housed in a formidable, elegant neo classical building with the establishment of the museum dating back to 1887. The displays are extraordinary and well displayed. It appeals to anyone who likes history and definitely gives visitors a detailed outline of this unique island country. Interesting informative diorama visuals and hands on exhibits that are suitable for youngsters and accompanying family alike. The second floor houses different galleries that focus on special themes as fashion, food, progress within the island community, photography etc. Each area takes time to explore. The most impressive display was the Story of the Forest which is a fascinating digital experience. It is a colorful, lively and fanciful digital display that leaves a pleasant memorable images in your mind. The museum is not free and the admission is more than a nominal fee but it is truly a first rated museum in Singapore."
"Usually museums can be boring but not the National Museum in Singapore there is so much history plus special displays you can immerse yourself in, especially the living dome see it for yourself so hard to describe the experience"
"The cashier was very good in informing us about the different ticket types, - we chose to combo ticket which covered the whole museum. The exhibitions are very well presented, - also included huge wall to wall film - and very interesting about the history of Singapore and also the emphasis on women's education etc. Learned a lot from this visit!"
"Without doubt, this is a brilliant, world class museum and a MUST for all visitors.We took the combined ticket(reduced rate for Seniors) and spent 4 hours on the special exhibition and the History Gallery only.It id possible to return another day on the same ticket. Ask and you will be issued with a new sticker.The museum is housed in a beautifully maintained colonial style building and is very well laid out, so the story flows. Helpful interpretation panels are not too wordy. The language is accessible and the text the right length.The cafe has a nice selection of reasonably priced light meals, snacks and drinks.Altogether an excellent museum!"
"I was lucky to arrive a little before 11 am and was told that a one hour tour was about to start. There were only a few of us on the tour. The tour guide was very interesting and took us around the two important old building. She showed us things I would likely not have seen and learned about the history of the buildings and and saw pictures of the way they used to look when they were the city hall and the supreme court. I then spent time looking at some of the art, which was interesting to see art of Asia and understand the way things used to be. To me that highlight was the tour and the two old buildings (and the way they were combined and updated to be a museum)."
"The whole experience of the musium was fantastic, the exhibitions and amount of things to see are truely amaising. We must also recomend that any one who visits the Museum to take advantage of the internal restaurant there. The friendy and most atentive staff will make your visit a pleasurable one. I can personaly recomend the home made Lemon Iced tea with wine, a delisiously refreshing drink. My wife nicknamed it alchoholic Ribeena because of the colour after you stired the wine into the Icedtea. I would go back there again just for another one."
Join the free guided tour in national museum if you have time. A great place to know singapore's history in the beautiful architecture
"The museum demonstrates the history and cultural identity of the country. I would recommend you to take the ticket with special exhibitions included ($26), as they have some amazing animated and interactive presentations."
Five Stars. Very informative and worth while. Cost reasonable and the information and learning opportunity was timely and valuable.
Always on the lookout for the history of where we were visiting the National Museum of Singapore was a must. We had booked a guided tour which was well worth the cost as the guide was informative and knowledgeable. Well worth the visit.
This is the place to understand the History and some of the culture in Singapore.My suggestion is to make it your first stop when you arrive the city (after the airport and your hotel of course).
I was shocked at how great this museum is. On the ground floor there is an excellent exhibit that showcases Singapore's history. You can easily spend all day at the museum! If you are short on time don't bother with the exhibits on the first floor as the ground floor is much more comprehensive.
"perhaps a tad expensive for foreigners to visit (AUD $90 for a family of 4 all exhibit tickets) but we are glad we went. The exhibits were well laid out, informative and interactive. We were there at Christmas time so the free guided tours were not available but it was still great."
"Both the permanent and temporary exhibitions were worth while. Also, they make it interesting and interactive, and they offer daily free tours around for the ones who want to learn more!I you want to see it ALL and you are like me, who wants to get the best out of it, you will definetely need to spend the whole morning/afternoon there...although this is very personal and up to each person."
"This was a hidden gem for me. Much larger than I thought and tally good exhibitions. Skip the free guided tour though, it was good but to slow."
"Excellent permanent exhibits of history and development of Singapore, very comprehensive, modern and easy to navigate.They also have special exhibits worth seeing , like the nature walk inside the museum.Easy to get to by metro."
"Beautifully cool (aim to be in there during the heat of the day) and fascinatingly historically interesting - from the humble beginnings of Singapore (or Singapura) though to Colonial times, invasion during WW2 and Life in Singapore during the 50's, 60's and 70's."
"We went again to this museum a favourite of ours.So much to see and not too many visitors in November.Before we hadn't been in to the basement and with our particular ticket we could ,well worth a visit.We hadn't realised that over 60's get a reduced fee for their ticket.Super cafe and very nice cakes and iced teas.Next time we are in Singapore definitely another trip to this museum with its beautiful architecture and spacious galleries.Everything is very well labelled."
"The National Museum offered us a great tour of the history of Singapore, its people and the melting pot culture that co-exists. What a delightful surprise you will have, the staid, conservative exterior is an interesting contrast tot he modern tour you take through the Museum. We especially enjoyed the special exhibit, visual extravaganza to delight your senses! I would recommend planning to spend a long afternoon here."
Well worth spending a few hours learning about Singapore history. Recommend the free English speaking tour.
We had a wet morning to fill in and the museum was close to our hotel. What a brilliant experience we had. We learnt so much about the history of Singapore. So much to see and to learn about . The story of the forest is worth seeing if you have children very cleaver animation. The section on WW2 is very interesting as well. I would visit again
Not cheap to view all exhibition. Great space. Would go back again. Excellent exhibitions. Staff very helpful
"The National Museum of Singapore is very complex, including many variate sections related to history, nature, culture, civil rights and so on. A great way to learn about and to better understand this unique country."
"This is where we started and the exhibition was very clear and helpful. Everything then fitted like a jigsaw puzzle when we visited Fort Canning, China Town, Raffles Place, Little India and explored this Wonderful island with so much history."
If you want to know about Singapore and it's amazing history this is the place to go. If you want to really get everything out of your visit allow yourself a minimum of 2 hours. I lasted visited here more than 4 years ago but all the displays have either been updated or replaced
"In a quaint beautifully conserved building, the exhibitions inside elegantly narrate the Singapore story and journey from its discovery by the British empire in 1819, through the Japanese occupation in World War 2, independence from British, merger with Malaya, all through til modern day independent Singapore.More than that, it also does great in portraying the life and culture of everyday Singaporeans. Until Mar 2020, they are also having 'An Old New World' exhibition covering the 700 years of history leading up to Britain's discovery."
This is an absolute must for visitors to Singapore as it sets out the history of the island to help put one's visit in context. The exhibits are displayed with great flair and imagination - it has to be one of the best museums I have visited. There are many audio visual displays which really help yo bring the history of this remarkable island to life.
"If you want to know more about the eventful history of Singapore, this is definitely the place to go. The exhibion room are very well curated and the information provided is excellent"
"Great remodelling job for SGD 530 Mio to put two historic buildings under one roof. Lots of space, perhaps a little bit underused. Take the free one-hour tour."
This museum correctly is regional in it's focus. Huge dollars have been plugged into the redo. There is some world class art
"Beautiful museum, elegant colonial building dating from 1887, 50th year of Queen Victoria's reign in neo-Palladian style, contrasted with light and airy modern addition plus subterranean exhibition spaces carved from beneath Fort Canning hill. Loved the few hours we spent here. Started with tour. Excellent guide, really engaging and knowledgeable. Fantastic overview of how Singapore has changed over the past 700 years. All the exhibitions were really well done, beautifully and clearly presented. Really increased my understanding of modern Singapore. Highly recommend a visit!"
We didn't have time to visit here on our first visit to Singapore so it was a 'must-do' for this trip. The building is impressive from the outside and no less so inside. It offers a huge area for wonderful displays and exhibitions telling the history of Singapore and its people. The Singapore History Gallery was our favourites and we also enjoyed the Modern Colony and the Story of the Forest exhibitions. There are several permanent exhibitions plus others that change throughout the year. You really do need to allow several hours to enjoy this museum fully. We did our own thing for most of our visit but we also booked one of the excellent guided tours around the Singapore History Gallery ' I wish that the lady guide had been my history teacher at school as she was just so enthusiastic and proud of Singapore. I would definitely visit again as you can't take it all in on just one visit. Highly recommended.
"We visited this museum for the first time and were pleasantly surprised.It is housed in a magnificent white colonial style building and has a number of exciting and informative exhibitions.As my father-in-law was captured by the Japanese in Singapore in WW2 we were particularly interested in the story of Singapore and its subsequent capture.We thought the exhibitions were very well thought out and the artefacts displayed were extremely interesting.The museum is a huge building which marries the old with the new. The architecture is stunning.We had lunch in the lovely 'Food for Thought' cafeteria, which was excellent.This museum is well worth a visit and we will certainly return should we be in Singapore again."
"This was our favorite museum in Singapore. Learned much about the history, culture, and very impressed with the first Prime Minister, Mr. Lee."
We are still talking about our visit and it has been a week. The museum is exceptionally well done and I highly recommend taking a tour. Our tour guide was super and handled a large group extremely well. The museum does a beautiful job of showing how what was happening in Singapore over 500 years tied into other parts of the globe. There were all ages on our tour and everyone was engaged. I want to also mention that I needed a wheelchair (I came on a knee scooter and wasn't allowed to take it inside). The staff provided a wheelchair and were really helpful and friendly. This was perhaps my 8-10th visit to Singapore but first to the museum. I would return happily. It is large and could take a full day. 2 restaurants on site.
"Allow approx 3 hours. This museum is not your average museum and it takes you through so much history, but not in a boring way. Was really enjoyed and I highly recommend."
Well worth a visit...history of Singapore is very poignant certainly an eye opener.Unable to comprehend how they were treated during the war.
"A great place. They even had what was named 'Quiet Mondays'; As per what I understood, if you go there early morning on Mondays, your visit will be quiet and peaceful as there won't be guided tours. The 'Syonan' exhibition (Japanese annexation of Singapore) is in my view'¦ A must!"
We have excellent guide who helped us explain us history of Singapore and also help us to enjoy in the Museum. Museum is overall excellent organized and very interesting.
Went here on a Monday and the price was 26 dollars for entry. Took one of the free guided tours by an american lady (pretty interesting insight on old pre colonial singapore) and visited the rest of the rooms there. Would recommend
Located at very convenient place. Open till 7.00pm . Highly recommend for travelers who want to see the S'pore history
"When visiting a city, I like to visit the museum so that I can find out about the city's past and I found this museum to be excellent. The information and films around WWII were very good."
The museum tells Singapore's different periods of history through brilliantly curated exhibits. I saw WWII from the 'Eastern' point of view for the first time and it was enlightening.The standard entrance fee is S$15 and it's worth every cent.Highly recommended!
Excellent historical overview of Singapore. Well organised displays in chronological order. Easy to reach by MRT.
This museum really knows how to prepare information and artefacts to catch the visitor's attention. It's very easy to follow the history of Singapore step by step and not to lose interest. The visuals are well selected and the information texts kept short but still including all the necessary information.It also shows some films where it is the best medium of choice and I must say that I have learned so much in just one day here.Would definitely recommend going here.
"My wife and I visit art museums worldwide and were pleasantly surprised wih the breadth and quality of the collections. The watercolor exhibit opened our eyes to the subtlties of the medium in a way we never thought possible. We discovered artists we never knew existed who painted in ways reminiscent of Renoir, Pollack, Matisse, Picasso, etc. There was too much to see in one day while jet-lagged, and we regret not having more time to spend there."
"We called in here late one day and the help desk recommended we come back another day as it was late, we managed to arrive back again on the 132nd anniversary of the museum so everything was free. Good museum with different exhibitions on Singapore, some highlights were the occupation history, opium den and the local stories about trees. Overall a great place to hang out for a day."
"In about an hour I got a good overview of Singapore history in words, photos and documents. Lots more to see but did not have time."
"Had a wonderful visit to the National Museum of Singapore today. Usually I struggle to spend more than 2 hours at an exhibition but today we were there for 4 1/2 hours. We really loved the 'An Old New World' exhibition (there until March 2020) but also loved learning about Singapore's history from spice port, colonisation, occupation to independence. Every display was well explained and had lots of interaction for all ages. All of the staff were really friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend a visit."
"While in Singapore for a 2 week holiday we were talking to one of the staff at the hotel we were staying at, and it was suggested that we may like to visit this particular museum. I'm glad we listened, because the visit was fascinating with all the different articles to look at and a feature there that either of us have never seen anywhere else before. Sort of a spiraling downward picture show, hard to explain, but the type of thing that children would be fascinated in as well as adults."
"It's been almost two decades since I visited the National Museum. I usually enjoy visiting museums but have had this (unfair) perception that this museum's displays are dull. A recent visit helped to dispel that feeling and made me see it in a brand new light. Housed in a grand mansion of a building that dates back to the 1840s, it underwent a long period of renovation before reopening in 2006. Unsurprisingly, its main exhibit is the history of Singapore. Using a variety of media, from physical mock-ups to dioramas to multimedia, visitors get to trace the island from its first historical mention in the 14th century, through its founding as a trading port by the East India Company on the early 19th century, to becoming a Straits Settlement and British colony over the next hundred or so years. The story then moves towards the Japanese occupation during the second world war, independence from Britain, and finally to its development as a sovereign nation. I especially enjoyed the displays pertaining to the development of police force as well as the effects of opium smoking. All this took me slightly over two hours to get through at a fairly lesiurely pace. I also walked through a temporary visually-stunning digital exhibition titled Story of the Forest which made clever use of the building's rotunda. And December being Children's Month at the museum, loads of kids were in attendance, mainly to have their photos taken next to the numerous Doraemon displays."
"We spent 2 hours at the oldest museum in Singapore, the National Museum. The cost to enter was $15, which I felt was reasonable value for the amount of time we spent in there. We honestly could have spent more but we had other places to be. There was so much to learn about the history of Singapore. I particularly liked the mural that could be seen as you descended the staircase and the exhibits that showcased some of the vintage Asian fashion."
"As Singaporeans, we get to enter the museum free. It was always a delight to visit as it has the Japanese occupation exhibits and displays and recordings from that period. It is a good place for good history lesson, This place can get boring if you have been here within the last 2 years as everything is still the same and exhibits doesnt change."
I went there with the family and it was a interesting experience for me as there were alot of facts about Singapore that i dont know. Some displays are boring.
"I've visited the national museums in Amsterdam and Iceland, and found Singapore's to be equally informative, providing the history of how Singapore was formed. We visited just as Covid-19 was starting to rev up, so there were likely fewer visitors than usual. It was a great way to get out of the heat for a couple of hours."
"I visited the museum as William Farquhar is my great, great grandfather and I knew there were items relating to him. We were shown round by a senior curator who made the visit very interesting and I learned so much about my relative. It is a lovely airy museum which has bee recently extended very well."
"This is one of the last things we did in Singapore. I wish I had done it sooner as the exhibits do a great job of explaining Singapore's history. It not only has historical exhibits but also some about the flora and fauna of the island. In addition it is also an incredible building that melds the old colonial library with a modern building giving multiple level hillside entrances. While the modern section is very open and airy, it is the old library that is so impressive inside and out. I really enjoy the exhibits on colonial life from the turn of the century to WWII as we as the ones on the Battle of Singapore and the Japanese occupation.Take the time to visit and it will better explain the Singapore of today."
Building is a must see. Exhibits seemed disjointed / fragmented. Try to sort though exhibits you really want to see before visit.
"Great museum. New exhibit on the history of the spice trade and development of Singapore was very interesting, with loads of information"
often eat here when meeting friends/ex-colleagues who are visiting SG from malaysia. a range of selections to choose from with most priced in the mid-range
"This museum is a treasure! Fantastic exhibitions showing the history of Singapore, from the early settlers, to Colonial Settlement, to Japanese occupation all the way to today. Got the 'access all areas' pass which allows you to see the limited edition exhibition as well as the permanent exhibitions - it was worth it. Ended up spending nearly 7 hours here, it is that good. Highly recommend it."
"We got there for a free 1-hour tour in English in the early afternoon, and the guide was quite good."
"This is the place to go for all your early Singapore history. I absolutely loved learning about the early explorers and how Singapore went from the 1800s onwards. If you love learning about the history, this will be the place to go. They also have a great little cafÃ© and shop."
"We visited this place few days ago.When I compare the museums in other countries, this is a small museum with low number of exhibits, and that is understandable, considering the small size of the country.Most of the exhibits focus on the last hundred years from World wars to the 2000s. However, there are few old exhibits as well.Anyway, in my opinion they have done a good job with what they have.My favorite part of the museum is the exhibits and descriptions about the recent development of Singapore, starting from 1950s. The commitment towards a well planned developed country is very inspirational. I strongly suggest this part of the Museum to visitors."
We spent a couple of hours here but should have allowed more time. The free one hour guided tour was very interesting and the Chinese lady who conducted it was very engaging. The celebration of the forest in the glass atrium was eye catching.
"Could get the knowledge about the history of Singapore. Although I frequented Singapore, I have missed this museum. The most impressive part was the recorded video speech of the first PM of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew. The resolution presented there when he decided to go apart from Malaysia, is still alive in the hearts of Singaporean."
"Spent a morning here recently and ran out of time. The museum is structured in a chronological order from the basement (pre-history up to initial European contacts) to the first floor (colonial era) to the second floor (independence and modern era). I'm the sort who wants to see and read everything and I really enjoyed it. They also have ""kid friendly"" interactive exhibits and some recreations of a room, or part of a ship, that you can walk into and around. Well done and well-structured."
A somewhat hidden gem. this is a really nice place to visit if you are a tourist wanting to know more about singapore or a local who wants to be better informed. There is currently an exhibition on Raffles which is really interesting. Well worth a visit. Singapore citizens and PR get free entry.
"I have to admit that prior to our visit to this large and informative museum I knew very little about Singapore history prior to Raffles. My eyes were opened to all aspects of the early history of Singapore. This is a big building with many exhibits. They had a digital display on during our visit called ""Story of the Forrest"". This was incredible. We spent over 3 hours wandering the halls and could hace spent more time. If you want to learn a little about the country you're visiting then I recommend a visit to this museum."
The building is definately well worth a look in itself. The museum tells the history of Singapore from its beginning to modern day.
"A detailed and interesting walk through Singapore's history. Nice mix of artifacts, photos, paintings, video, audio. There was a docent-led tour, but we missed it because we didn't know about it. What we overheard was informative and would have added value to the whole experience, so ask about it when you go. There was also a surprisingly compelling small photographic exhibit of S'pore trees, and a small exhibit outlining what Singapore has done to achieve gender equality, notable women, etc. The 2-3 hours spent here enhanced our understanding and appreciation of Singapore."
Easily accessed with the MRT. Staff at the Reception desk were very helpful. This museum has a wealth of knowledge of past and present Singapore. Beautifully show-cased.
"I visited the National Museum of Singapore in October 2019. I had been here once before in 2016 and decided to return. You can get here by the MRT (subway) by going to Dhoby Gaut and then walking. It is a little hard to find so ask for directions. I focused on the History Gallery although the museum offers a lot more. The History Gallery covers the founding of Singapore by Raffles, World War 2 and the Japanese occupation, the leadership and contributions of Lee Kuan Yew, and many other things. After the History Gallery there is an exhibit on Singapore's economic data which was very interesting. There were a lot of other things to see in the museum but unfortunately I did not have time. Maybe my next time in Singapore."
"An excellent museum depicting the history of this amazing little country.A museum which Singaporeans can be justly proud.The modern architectural features added to the already magnificent neo-Palladian and Renaissance style building is simply superb, well worth a visit."
Very interesting few hours spent getting to understand the bigger picture of the birth of this tiny great nation... from before the visiting East India power house to the true birth of the nation with the power and genuine desire of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.. what a great man .... and what a great legacy he created.... give it a go and see for yourself....
"Super museum well set out charts the history of Singapore to the present day, spent much longer than expected here as really informative and interesting. Glass tower was a bit strange but probably great if you have children"
"Well kept and has a great voyaging section. But as a young nation, nothing ancient or amazing to see"
"You will be advised to start on the top level, and work your way down levels to ground floor. We came in the afternoon, and with hindsight, would have moved through the top floor more quickly and allowed more time for the ground floor to better absorb all of the information. Very well organised museum."
"This is am excellent museum with a good balance between not too much / not too little informationThey're are modernly curated galleries, and interesting displays.Main issue is that some of the labelling is darkly lit and therefore difficult to readAlso, not cheap for what it is"
"The building is beautiful from the outside and also has an impressive atrium inside, which was bright and airy. The main exhibition is a great overview of how Singapore came to be the place it is today and is informative and interactive at times. Doesn't shy away from some of the challenging topics either. Other areas are well done too - the room which describes WWII activity and the light show were highlights. If you have a Singapore Airlines boarding pass, you get discount too."
"I have to admit that the exhibitions weren't as extensive and I assume its because Singapore isn't an old country. But, the way the exhibitions were created made it very engaging and interactive. The architectural build of the museum itself was magnificent.Inside, the museum was equipped with facilities for the less mobile.It is also very accessible via MRT (I exited at Bencoolen station and walked about 5 minutes to reach the museum)"
Great if you're a traveller that loves to learn the history of the country you're visiting. Allow a few hours to get through all the exhibits as there is plenty to see and read. Admission price is very reasonable at $26 per person.
"A must place to visit. There's different levels of attraction. It's always interesting knowing the history on each country. There's an exhibition just started recently and will last till March 2020. It's called ""an old new world."" Check that out."
"Great gallery on the 1st floor (this is the main gallery). As someone with a short museum attention span, this was a good size. Throughout the exhibit, you'll notice many displays reference ""Fort Canning Park"". Once you're done with the museum, go outside and walk to Fort Canning Park (bordering the museum) to check it out for yourself and get some fresh air."
Really worth timing trip to coincide with the free tours that are offered. History of Singapore well explained.Food in restaurant nice but expensive. Cafe was closed.
"For those who visit Singapore on a stopover,visiting the museum is a very easy way to find out about the fascinating history of the island. The museum is easy to get to, well laid out, and informative. It is also entertaining, with many multimedia and audio-visual displays. Well worth the effort and the entry fee."
"Well Singapore does not have a long history or a world class collection, but the folks at the museum try hard to make it an informative experience for the visitor and generally do okay. Lots of information on the rather short history of the nation; probably a bit too much resulting in rather cramped exhibits and too much stuff in the same room. There is also a multimedia show in the glass rotunda - best for small kids. The garden with local fauna is probably worth a quick look. There are also special exhibitions going on, worth a quick look - generally well organized and informative. Though a reasonably good museum, not really worth a special trip unless you are interested in the history of the nation."
This is a museum where you walk through it with enjoyment and learn; it is airy and modern -- without glass cases of old relics. It's a great mix of old and new.
"It has been more than 10 years since I last visited the National Museum and was amazed with its new look. Of interest were the four gallaries spanning the past 100 years: Modern Colony, Surviving Syonan, Growing up and Voices of Singapore where snapshorts of everyday life throughout the different eras of Singapore history were displayed.The other interesting areas were: Singapore History Gallery; Singapore, very old tree; Goh Seng Choo Gallery: Magic & Menance; Story of the Forest."
"Clearly, the National Museum of Singapore aims to educate the young of the island in the varied history of the republic. There is less here for a more advanced connoisseur of history."
Best place to explore the history & culture of Singapore. Visualize the architecture. Building looks like a fusion of old & new
"Museum has a very impressive display outlining Singapore's history, focusing largely upon political movements prior to the Japanese invasion, and the invasion itself, which cannot help but raise questions about how the British failed to protect one of its own colonies. Much of what Lee Kuan Yew, who became Singapore's Prime Minister following the Japanese surrender, said did echoes very much Singapore's post incursion and determination to create a nation of independence. What is displayed in this museum provides very clear evidence of this history.An absolutely delightful added attraction in the museum is a gallery (open only at certain times), which features an emphasis on forest conservation. The display also includes an unquestionably beautiful sensory experience within the ""Glass Rotunda""."
Good range of material on a historical timeline from founding of a settlement to modern times. Plenty to see from a range of perspectives.
"We approached the museum from the rear - from Fort Canning Park - and the modern annex is huge and airy. The first display was a sinuous curve of very detailed text about the trades unions and their part in independence - I tried, but it was far too much to read. We walked over the Glass Passage connecting the two parts of the museum.The free exhibits included large rooms on the history of Singapore, including one devoted to the Japanese occupation. It is interesting reading some of the comments here by Japanese tourists. They generally do not know much about it at all. NMS has a mandate to explain the recent history of the country and it does that well.Some of the exhibits on other aspects are underwhelming. We did not, on that basis, pay for tickets to the other parts of the museum. However, the original Victorian building is a gem! We were only in Singapore for a few days, but it was worth seeing the dome from the inside first and then seeing the faÃ§ade from the road last. Truly a treasure worth maintaining but it struggles to compete on the world stage of national museums."
We did a free guided tour of the museum with a volunteer guide. Our guide was very knowledgeable and answered all our questions. She took us on a tour of Singapore's history and culture and it was really interesting to see Singapore's development. We did this tour on our first day in Singapore and it opened our eyes for the rest of the trip!
"We stayed at YMCA@One Orchard which is right next to the museum. With our Singpaore tourist pass, we had SG$2 discount. There were many exhibits and interesting history on Singapore."
Lovely Colonial building with a great art display inside.Will take a fair time to go around the whole building. Fantastic water garden on top of building with a bar and great view
"Do not let the traditional look of the museum's exterior fool you, the exhibits and the presentation media within make it as contemporary and impressive as the city state that surrounds it. A literal walk through the history of Singapore with a great layout of galleries, interesting artifacts and many multi-media presentations."
"Though this might not be the first time we have gone to the musuem, my kids still love it coz they always have new themes and exhibits. The current theme is very suitable for kids (just curious).My girls aged 8 and 10 loved all the 4 themes. They had fun with the gigantic puzzles, weighing the anchor, fixing back the vases and of course the bouncy castle and interactive in the Stories of Forest. I forgot to mentioned they loved drawing and colouring their toy and get to play some of the traditional games.I have also bought the interactive guidebook which they enjoyed working on it and reading it whenever they saw the artefact in the permanent gallery. We have not finished with the entire book in the musuem and do intent to visit the musuem once again to finish up the remaining activies.Overall, recommended for all to go."
"Wonderful, updated building. Great display on the history of Singapore. Great way to learn about local history for a first time visitor. There was also an interesting exhibit on packaging. Near the university."
"If you want a good overview of Singapore's history, this is the place to visit. Very informative displays, highly effective use of media and diverse materials all help the visitor to gain a good understanding of this island's past."
"Housed in a series of buildings that skillfully blend the historic with contemporary museum design, the SNM has some exhibits worth seeing by anyone wanting to understand how the dynamic city of Singapore rose rapidly from sets of rural villages. These exhibits are a well-curated set of objects and subtle digital effects.The food an beverage offerings are quite good and the staff throughout the museum were unfailingly welcoming and helpful."
"As Singaporeans, we get free admission so it's a good idea to come every now and again to view the temporary exhibitions and see how the permant galleries are updated. Was very pleased to find that the history of Singapore had additional and interesting information on the surrender of Singapore, the Japanese Occupation and the separation of Singapore from Malaysia. Even more gratified to find the presentation of facts objective and non-controversial, very fair to all parties and countries involved, but details certainly giving rise to individual responses eg presentation of the Tiger of Malaya, General Yamashita, his trial and execution, the Sook Ching Massacre, Lee Kuan Yew's arguments for merger with Malaysia. There was a very good docent guiding at 11am and while not part of the group, overheard her insightful and humorous commentary which was much appreciated by the visitors.Found the temporary exhibition on 'Packaging' nostalgic, and the items, eg F n N bottles, posters well-sourced and preserved. Also enjoyed again the Enchanted Forest with the digitalized walk imaginatively put together with lovable small creatures, colorful flora and even tropical rain and melodic sounds.However, it's rather confusing finding your way around and the restrooms' signage is incredibly difficult to identify especially as the one near the entrance has been usurped by ' Food for Thought' , this food outlet looking rather uninviting with over-priced Western fare. Better to walk a bit to Food Republic across the road for delicious local fare."
"Very beautiful building, very kind and helpful staff, all exhibitions help you ,clearly, to understand Singapore story. I spent 2.5 hours and really I enjoyed. The only .... poor was the museum shop,small and without any attractive think ,except ofcourse some nice books."
Ticket is 15$ or 10$ if your 're student.Architecture and interior design of the musuem is amazing. They split it into different halls to represent different eras of singapore. They screen a couple pf short documentatries starring real singaporeans.It is nicely done and informative.You can also catch the free guided tours if you go on time
Great learning journey to understand about Singapore history and culture. Exhibits are comprehensive and informative with interactive elements. Walk down the enchanting forest experience to enter the museum. Many artefacts to view.
I thought it was a really good hour spent there. For the first 20 mins I was fascinated but then it just got too much for me.Looking at the history of Singapore the stuff they have from the war even a tank which I found fascinating. Some of the drawings as well were really good.I think for kids it will be a bit too much and boring. It's more for adults.For adults there is a charge as well of 15SGD if you are a non resident.
"I allowed a couple of hours to check the national musuem. Everything, as you would expect in Singapore, is well organised and presented. Many great exhibits but I found myself in the history of Singapore - including the battlebox and wartime section - to be fascinating - and a good pre cursor to the battlebox down the road in Fort Canning.A little disappointing that there is a nominal charge to get in."
"Wasn't expecting to have to pay to enter the National Museum as most big museums in the UK are free to enter but with a voluntary donation so we were unsure about whether to continue with our visit.The exhibits are definitely worth spending half a day at if you're interested in the history of Singapore right from the early settlers, through the war to modern Singapore. There's a good range of interactive exhibits and different things to see.The main exhibition downstairs is a little confusing to navigate at first, I was unsure which order I was meant to go round the exhibit in but once you're through to the WW2 section it's much better layed out.It's fantastically cool inside, enough so that I actually ended up being cold! Perhaps take an additional layer. Didn't eat at the museum as there's a food court just down by Bras Basah MRT."
Museum is relatively inexpensive ad for Singapore standard (free for PR and Citizen). Some exhibitons are very interesting (e.g. Magic in South East Asia) while some are just lame (doom with forest).
"This museum is stunningly beautiful building and an excellent and easy way to learn about the fascinating history of Singapore. We`ve been here before and usually have lunch in the cafe, but it was disappointing on this occasion. Not up to their usual high standard."
"I had not been to this museum in many years, but on a recent trip made a visit and very glad I did. The building is a very nice Colonial style building, and the museum tells the interesting history of Singapore as a trading post to the financial center it is today.The exhibits are very visually appealing, and everything flows together nicely.Everyone, but particularly first time visitors to Singapore, should go and learn about Singapores interesting history, from colonialization, to independence to modern day city/ state."
"Close to the other main museum this one covers the creation and growth of Singapore in an interesting way and has the "" must see ""Raffles Statue close by. Reachable on foot and by tourist boats."
"Educational, well done and worth the minimum $. Youngsters will enjoy the displays as much as us old folk. Cool and inviting with great displays and organization. The building is classic Victorian. Modernized, clean, cool and inviting. Well worth a visit perhaps after the Battle Box. Can be busy, so get there mid morning at the latest.. Expect to spend 2-3 hours."
"We visit the museum each time we come to Singapore. The displays are always very interesting. This time we viewed the colony from 1925-1935, to see how life was then. A number of exhibitions going on all the time. Early Singapore, the war years, the evolution to what Singapore is today. A nice cafe and also a fine dining room in the building."
"This is a fantastic museum, great displays taking you on a journey from past to present. Interesting to learn about how life returns post war. We were able to get discounted tickets through Klook, but the prices at the museum are very reasonable. Bonus of free wi-fi as well to upload those many pictures. This museum blends the old with very modern displays as well. A great half day outing. The hilight for us was the glass rotunda exhibit, probably meant for kids but we adult kids thoroughly enjoyed the sensory input."
"Although a large museum, the exibitions are relatively small so you do not fell overwhelmed. Has a very good history of early singapore and another relating to the fall of singapore and the recovery from the Japanese occupation. Well worth a visit."
"This is a really good example of a modern museum. The displays are well thought out and there is a good mix of text, photos and displays etc to keep you interested.Having been through the ground floor, I came away knowing a lot more about the history of Singapore and the major events that shaped it as a country.There's a lot to see, so spare a few hours if you like to take it all in as I do!"
The main exhibition provided a great overview of the discovery and settlement of Singapura and its journey to Singapore as it is known today. A must see if you want to understand the Singapore of today.
"An excellent display if the history of Singapore through the ages. Well set out and detailed.I joined a guided tour in Englidh that took ab out an hour, then I went back and covered the parts It missed out and those it covered that i wanted to see and read in more detail.In an expensive city this was excellent value and well worth a few hours of the day"
"I lucked out and entered just before the free 2 PM tour was to start. That tour hit the highlights of the museum in 1.5 hours (was supposed to be 1.0 hours). After that tour, I did the rest of the exhibits. I was expecting more, so was disappointed. I paid $19."
Intersting history contained within the bottom level. Museum seemd disjointed though and hard to work out what our ticket did and did not include to visit. Not a free museum although some people were able to wander about with out tickets.
musuem did not meet my expectations. I still did not follow the history of singapore even after viewing.
"This, to my mind, was how not to run a museum; (though how too many museums are run these days.) There was far too much emphasis on 'interaction' and staging and not enough illumination and education for my (admittedly olf fashioned,) taste. There were a lot of very good exhibits, and obviously a lot of very good intentions, but somehow it did not come together: too much staginess in some areas. The Singapore History exhibition relied too much on dodgy sets and animations. What was that walk down the spiral through the forest all about? Poor quality CGI that, if it was telling a story, rather kept is hand well shielded. Do animals mince? I don't think our negative reaction was just because we are old grumps: it did not seem to grab the attention of the kids either.There was just too much trying hard. Does the tragedy of the Syonan-to period really need a soundtrack of Japanese dive bombers and exploding bombs to get it across, or does that actually detract from the message? Elsewhere, I am afraid I would have had the temerity to question the description of one or two items. In the end we left thinking a return visit to the Asian Civilisations Museum would have been a better use of time."
"You can skip this if you want to explore antique or history other than Singapore's.Price of icket is varied by the gallery, anyway there is an option for all-you-can-visit ticket. Anyway the presentation here is quite creative with effect and audio.They even have a global photography show which is interesting."
"I'll be generous and give this place three stars. Relative to most of the world, Singapore doesn't have extensive history and it shows. Much is made of Japanese occupation during the second world war. Museum layout is illogical and many exhibits lack innovation. If you're in Singapore for a week it's probably worth a look. Any shorter, I'd venture elsewhere."
"The museum is worth a visit, even just to step inside and away from the humidity for a few hours.While I found most things interesting enough to read through the story behind the artifact, the new laser type displays don't do much for me.Yet you do get an excellent understanding of the history behind the country."
"There was nothing overly exciting for me to see there but if you are interested in museums, want to get out of the heat and are really into Singapore's history than it will be the right place for you. Else you might be better off spending your time with things you are more interested in."
Went to Bras Basah to check out the Night Festival. They had a colorful light projection onto facade of National Museum. Very nice and entertaining.
"The national museum is very close the Battlebox and I would recommend to combine the two together. The part that I found interesting is the historical one. One get a good understanding of Singapore's history, economical background and culture. The rest of the museum was not anything special."
Although I looked at the brochure/map I still found it a little confusing to follow the best way to see this museum. We seemed to start at the most recent time and work our way back and I would have thought it would be better the other way around but didn't figure it out. We got a Seniors discount on entry so it cost us $10 each. It is located in a beautiful building. Give it a go if you have spare time.
"The best part was the architecture of the old building. Magnificent facade great dome. Behind that is a new extension.Inside someone greets you and profiles you.Overseas, under or over 60 or local.Locals free others pay.There are 2 main levels. Nothing in basement when i went.The exhibits highlight the history of Singapore.Going through on my own i felt the exhibits were a bit weak. The tour for me helped a lot.Can spends a few hours at most there."
"Mostly for older kids and adults. History, artefacts, photos. Old building and new modern wing. Playground on top floor for small kids. ï¸ and snack available. Very well accessible with metro ."
Museum was surprisingly simple with its presentation of Singapore history - thus a broad outline of their past.
"Nicely kept and well maintained old time Singapore building, you will pass and visit if on Singapore bus tour. Well worth visit to learn Singapore's history."
"In this artificial city where everything seems plastic, finally a place where some light is cast on the roots of the population.The story is clearly a marketed message, not very deep or critical, but one's can extract some interesting intuitions.The visit is quick, the venue is central, overall an activity preferable to the other city museums."
"I visited the museum some years ago and recently returned to find that it has been somewhat renovated. When I visited 7 years ago , there was an excellent multi-layered presentation with information from scholars to short description on objects presented via an electronic gadget and visitors could choose from a personal or official path to learn about Singapore's history. It appears that some sections have been removed, and there is no e-device that offers more depth info for self tours. The history gallery has adopted a more parochial look and the galleries on the upper levels are simplistic and generally poorly designed with the exception of the Modern gallery which was quite charming."
This particular one charges $15 per ticket unlike other museums in Europe which are mostly free! The inside is not so great as their history is also not that old and colourful!! End of the day not worth it .
"Beautiful building, lovingly created from British Colonial court. The art on display is pretty eclectic, but little of the modern rubbish. Also quite close to the Asian Civilization Museum, which is well worth a visit as well."
"Its a great place to have a day off the busy city life and slow down to enjoy the various exhibits. These changes from time to time and when I was there, it had several gallery showing the history of Singapore through the 19 - 20 century. It was pretty interesting."
"Museum is ok but the cafe and staff are worth a visit. Good food and snacks, the scrambled eggs are lovely."
We spent two hours here on their independence day. The World War 2 exhibition was very good but some parts of the place were closed off.
This museum has some excellent exhibits detailing the historical and cultural development of Singapore. If that's what you're into you will enjoy this museum. For our money the Asian Civilizations Museum was a much preferable experience.
If you get the opportunity go on the free guided tour. A great way to learn about the history of Singapore.
"This is a highly rated attraction and relatively new. I wonder why many modern museums are so gloomy which among other things makes it difficult to read the explanations of the exhibits, It certainly provides plenty of information about the history of Singapore so would be a good starting point for the first time visitor."
The museum is smaller than I expected but it is a beautiful space. Really enjoyed the different decade rooms - particularly 1920's - 30's.
A couple of hours respite from the heat. Cost us $15 each to enter. Interesting presentation of Singapore's development. Learnt some new things. Close to Bencoolen mrt. If you are into history and need some relief from the heat then you will enjoy it more than me. Not really my thing. I should have gone to bugis to shop!
"Went here to spend a rainy afternoon whilst on holiday in Singapore. It was ok. Not very well laid out and was told we must start upstairs, so we did and then ended up back on the lower floor totally confused! There is a lot on display but we didnt learn very much about Singapore. Loads of children there but personally I wouldnt recommend as I would think they would be bored, not enough interactive exhibits or much in the way of excitement. Spent a couple of hours strolling around but only go if you have spare time, I certainly wouldnt say its a 'must see'."
"Very good section on the WW2 part of Singapore's history. A little expensive, compared to National Gallery and Asian Civilisations, and maybe not fully worth it."
"The museum is dedicated to the history of Singapore, but it is not very interesting and very poor. The most interesting thing is the Story of the Forest art installation."
"There are 2 type of tickets , standard one only can see 5 rooms history display , nothing supprise me , just few simple old personal things collection display only , well the ticket is also not expensive , any way I like the colonial building construction and inside with modern renovate design ."
"This museum does a decent job of showing you interesting bits of Singapore history in small doses. There are four or six galleries that break down history into 10 year periods which are quick to see if you don't want to spend all day in a museum. And well done as well. Also, right now - Feb 2018 - there is an excellent exhibit about the Japanese occupation of 1942. Best part are the oral histories of actual survivors. You stand in a circular space listening to their first hand account and watch pencil and ink sketches depicting the events as they tell it. SUPERB!"
The focus here is Singapore history. I'm a history buff and so was looking forward to my visit. I can't put my finger on why but this museum was something of a snooze. Surely the history of Singapore can be told with more pizzazz.
"Just like any museum, nothing special. But I felt the admission fees is expensive, $15 per person. I don't think I will go back."
"The National Museum wasn't that appealing to a foreign tourist. There wasn't much help at the help desk and it was quite gloomy. On top of that, the unreasonable price couldn't be matched to the lowly facilities that they offered. Luckily for us, we entered from the back entrance (straight road from the Battlebox) which basically gave us a free entry."
"Nothing special, but good presentation of Singapore's history, from ancient times to the present. There was also a good temporary multimedia exhibit."
"The history section on the ground floor was the best bit, but it was still a little empty. It touched on the key stages in the history of Singapore, but there was no depth, no discussion and no tension. In fact, I had trouble working out a story as I moved from room to room, just artifacts and portraits and points in time. Suddenly brittish appear, suddenly there's a malaysian independence, then suddenly, there's independent singapore. Singapore is such a melting pot, it would have been good to see the Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist cultures learning to live together (with both ups and downs), the struggle with Colonial powers, and the wider Malaysia and the trials of becoming a modern city. Maybe this museum is more for the locals and assumes we already know the details."
A great museum that gives you a good understanding of how this country was formed. My one small criticism is that sometimes the museum can seem a bit disjointed when you enter one part you can miss something else and have to go back
"This is the place to ""kill"" time on a sunny hot day, while hosting oversea guests.You able to understand the history of Singapore as you walk through all the things exhibition hall. There are many interactive devices like torch screen TV and headphone by the station/artifacts.You need to buy ticket to access to the exhibition hall. SGD15/adult.You able to reach there by public transport ."
"We'd done most of the big attractions in Singapore, and thought this would be an interesting hot/rainy day activity......and it did score on that aspect. The exhibits were interesting for the most part, but it lacked a coherent ""flow"" and the animations were a tad garish and amateurish (especially in the forest exhibit). I would have liked more of a time-line to guide us through the history of Singapore. Maybe, I would have got more out of it if we'd been in time for the guided tour. We did visit most of the rooms, and we it was informative. Would recommend as a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. $15 adults, $10 for seniors (over 60)."
Spent a couple of hours here learning about the history of Singapore. There are five galleries in the main building (four upstairs and one downstairs) which cover different periods of Singapore's history. Start upstairs to go in chronological order. The basement is a kind of whole history so repeats a lot of information from the upstairs galleries.My favorite sections were the gallery on the first floor (the building of modern Singapore) and a section in the basement which talks about modern Singapore.
"This can not be titled a National Museum with these exhibits - very disappointing and vary un-Singaporean! The various time period rooms were just a collection of posters skimming over events, with the WWII time frame totally distorted and uninformative. The ground floor history gallery was a bit better, but a total maze of rooms that had me going round in circles and I'm sure I missed things as a result. Singapore has a large amount of museums covering all sorts of subjects and periods, but visitors tend to head to the National Museum first because of the name, so why not make it a truly National Museum rather than a superficial look at the country. Singapore has such a fabulous history and culture and this needs to be housed under the National banner rather than in numerous other smaller venues."
"As an American accustomed to the Smithsonian museums in Washington, D.C., I may be prejudiced, but there just wasn't much here. The galleries on the second floor provided a superficial look at life in Singapore and the one on the World War II years was a particular letdown. Of more interest was the Singapore History Gallery on level one, but I found the layout of that gallery very confusing. The Flutes restaurant displayed a menu of impressive, but expensive Western dishes. Definitely not a must see, but located near Bras Basah and Dhoby Ghaut MRT stations if you go. Admission was Singapore $10 for seniors. Gift shop is on level one. Restrooms on every level."
"Not a must see but the Flutes restaurant is well worth a visit. The food, wine and service was excellent. The museum itself seemed to lack focus."
Felt this place wasn't much of an actual museum they have a 3 D type room which is relaxing. Only go if it's raining there are better things to do in Singapore.Loved the architecture.
I found the exhibits on the ground floor to be boring. You can only see so many pieces of broken china and look at so many paintings. The exhibit on the first floor however were interesting. I enjoyed looking back at life in Singapore in the 1920' s-until 1970's. That was worth the price of admission.
Maybe a little boring for very young child. But the food was good and it was great to learn some of the history of Singapore.
"The building is beautiful. The exhibition inside is about the history of Singapore, and I personally feel that it is a bit boring."
In a quiet area with several parks and easy access with nearby metro station. It's not impressive if you do not want to pay the ticket just take some photos ...
Great architecture. A nice cafe for a break. Not outstanding for the region and printed materials very limited.
"The museum is in a spectacular building and the displays are well layed out and well explained as you'd exoect from a modern museum. But for $15 I expected there to be more...could easily be done in an hour.Small expensive coffee shop, hardly any gift shop."
Spent a couple hours at the museum. As for most of the city it is clean and nicely presented. You will learn about the history of Singapore but don't expect any fascinating artefacts or exhibits.
"The National Museum of Singapore offers a comprehensive overview of Singapore's history from the establishment of the very first fishing village by a passing King to the post-independence development and industrialization. However, unless you visit this as soon as possible during your Singapore holiday, you will find it a tad boring. I didn't get here till me last day and having already been to the Former Ford Factory, Battle Box, Changi Museum, Singapore City Gallery, Arts House at Old Parliament, Chinatown Heritage Centre, Peranakan Museum and many others, I found that the National Museum was repeating what I had already seen. The smaller Life in Singapore Galleries on the 2nd floor did not add much to the main (and extremely well-presented) Singapore History Gallery on the ground floor. The Glass Rotunda displays a Disney-style little kids magic forest with zero connection to Singapore. The National Museum is undoubtedly a good museum, but I found visiting individual attractions made for a more enjoyable experience."
Nice place to have a stroll through on a hot day and take in the exhibits and history of Singapore. Worth a visit if you have some free time.
We stopped for a snack during our visit to this excellent museum. The food and drinks were average but very expensive.
"Started in 1887, it offers an insight the life of Singaporeans. There is a seamless blend of neo modern architecture with the old. Do not forget to check out the Singapore History and Living galleries."
"As it turned out this museum wasn't a museum of natural history (which is what I was expecting when I walked in through the door) but rather a museum of the history of the city of Singapore. It was actually quite interesting, and told me a lot more about the background of the city that the exhibition I visited the last time I was here (which was basically the story of Singapore told through the newspaper). It is interesting, but probably not a go to place if there are other things you wish to do."
"This place is huge. The art is terrific but most confusing.The museum shop is fun, the building is incredible and the roof garden wonderful."
A fun and interesting museum of artifacts and paintings. Excellent way to keep cool for a couple hours. More for adults and teens. Quiet area.
"it took almost 1 and half an hour to visit all the halls , fortunately the same time a wedding cermony was on in progress , so we had a chance to see some local traditional dressing and cermony too."
"I visited this Museum after taking a wonderful tour of the Battlebox as it is very close to Fort Canning Park.The lady on the desk was very helpful and advised me that a tour would begin at 1 p.m. if I would like to join it. She pointed to the spot where I was to meet the guide. As I had an hour to wait, I went and had a fish and chips lunch (S$16.00 ++) at the Terrace CafÃ©. Unfortunately the fish, covered in thick batter, was almost inedible because the fillets under the batter were dark and slimy.At 12.50 p.m. I returned to the place which had been pointed out to me but when no-one else had turned up by 1.20 p.m. I left and explored the exhibits by myself.I agree with the previous reviewer who said that the exhibit which explains the history of Singapore is like a maze. I found it disjointed with no clear indication of the pathway to follow in order to view the displays. Therefore, I often found myself out of sequence with the timeline.I had afternoon tea at the Food For Thought CafÃ©, which was very crowded, before walking to Bras Basah MRT Station to catch the train back to my hotel."
"Entrance fee is discounted for those 60 years or older. Just show proof of your age.I waited for the Guided Tour to begin for about 40 minutes, only to find out that the guide would be talking in Korean. There are only two floors of exhibits during my visit: Ground Floor and Second Floor.The Gallery that shows the history of Singapore is confusing! I felt like I was walking in a maze! The exhibits at the second floor are broken down by certain time segments. Nothing there caught my interest!Felt like the exhibits at the Asian Civilizations Museum are more interesting and entrance is FREE!"
We spent some time walking around the permanent history of Singapore exhibition (the Singapore History Gallery). It was certainly interesting and good to learn how Singapore came to be what it is today. We also visited the temporary 'What is Visible is not Invisible' exhibition which was more interactive and very enjoyable. Lucky we visited on a quiet weekday morning and had most of the exhibitions to ourselves which added to the enjoyment.
"We got an impression of Singapore's history at the museum. In the basement there was a contemporary exhibition, mainly with video works. This will last until February 2017.Look for more reviews by MulleEllum."
"The museum have some informative items, but nothing really special. It is just like compilation of few informative stuffs in one place. So instead of searching in books about history of Singapore, one can just visit this museum to see some old photos, old movies or little stuff about olden days Singapore. There are some old drawings and also old and new paintings. The other museum (Asian Civilization museum) have more interesting things to see."
"It's important to remember that I'm coming at this from an Irish perspective and so I expect a museum to have a lot of old stuff, very old stuff! This one does not, I understand that Singapore is a young country but vast space is thinly furnished with exhibits from WWII and poorly edited shows about the great kampong fire, I understand that this is an important event but the details are explored exhaustively.The building itself is wonderfully restored, all credit for this amazing job which marries the old a new in a world class example of how to restore and modernise an old space. I hope over time the management here with think outside the box and develop this museum to broader and more griping. Having said all that it's worth a visit."
We decided to visit based on other reviews that suggested this was quite a child friendly destination. While the building itself was beautiful we did feel that the majority of the exhibits on show when we visited were more aimed at adults (or at least teenagers). The sections on Singapore's history and cultures etc were well presented and informative with lots of reading and visual displays to enjoy. We just wish we didn't have two primary school age kids trying to hurry us along! On a positive we had a lovely lunch at the relaxed cafe on sites (especially the beef salad). Worth a visit if you are the target audience or have more patient/cultured kids than us ;)
"I went here as I wanted to learn about Singapore pre colonial rule. The displays are interesting and informative but I was expecting a bigger collection. The post WWII and modern history area did not interest me at all and my entire visit was over in about 40 minutes. Not much here for kids, and I was happy to move on."
The building looks fantastic both inside and out but that was really where the experience faltered. The museum was poorly organised and confusing in its displays. It was enjoyable enough but could have been so much better if better organised. I would personally avoid this one if in Singapore which is a real shame.
The setting for this museum is spectacular in itself however unfortunately not enough of the building is on show. The museum is very well presented and provides a run down of the Malay Peninsular right through to independence for the Singapore state. There is very limited number of original artefacts to complement the displays - however there are numerous replicas and all is laid out in a very imaginative way. I spent around 2 hours here including a visit to the cafe. There are additional special exhibits which would take longer. I recommend if you are in the area and have some time to spare.
"I always enjoy visiting museums but this one was not what I was looking for. Well, thinking of the history of Singapore, probably this museum has interesting items. But most of them were pretty modern collections. You may be able to find similar items in your garage. This place may be interesting for people who want to learn about Singapore, but not exciting for people who want to enjoy art or old things."
"I went to see Lucy Liu's art, which was stuck here because the art museum was closed for renovation. The rest of the place is an old colonial-style museum (so is the art museum)that is all about the history of Singapore. It's pretty mundane. At least the AC was working."
as few years ago the place was closed and we had time in this visit - we tried.not to the point - nice as children place - not serious for adults that want real facts and not a simple (very simple) presentation.I wanted to see more of the life and got general stories and some pictures...unless you are with children - not a requirement in any visit to Singapore
"Closest MRT station is Bras Basah but it's not exactly next to the museum, which is located near Fort Canning park. Exhibits were not that interesting, admission was kind of pricey. Would not visit again."
"The best historical exhibition in Singapore is the Art Gallery (in the refurbished Court House, overlooking the historical Cricket ground). Great collection, wonderful architecture. The second best is the Asian Civilizations Museum, just down the road from it. The National Museum is a distant third. The main display is pedestrian, while the digital display (Rain forest) is childish, and I don't mean that as a compliment. Even the inept ArtSceince Museum is moderately engaging by comparison. Unless you have may days to spare, or are looking for a wedding shoot location, I would put this place well down the list."
I did not like much even my 5 year old son also bored.Not easy access. I would prefer to go science center then this.
"I was very disappointed in the exhibition covering the history of Singapore - in particular the section covering the Japanese occupation during WWII.The exhibition gives the impression that life under Japanese rule wasn't too bad as long as you followed the rules and got the right permits. There is no mention of Sook Ching which was the systematic killing of members of the Chinese population. Officially Japan claims that fewer than 5,000 deaths occurred, while Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first prime minister, said ""verifiable numbers would be about 70,000"". In 1966 Japan agreed to pay S$50 million in compensation, half of which was a grant and the rest as a loan. They did not make an official apology.I do not understand how this could not be mentioned in the exhibition or is it that the museum authorities do not wish to offend anyone. Whitewashing history is wrong."
"My immediate observation was of disappointment. Disappointment that such a beautiful city full of fascinating history that occurred in recent times, is displaying minimalist facts and most in dark rooms.The steps through the major periods are conservative, and yet in reality were dynamic.The rotunda is a space that could take you through an experience of life lived through the many wars, habitants, and technology.This is my view and I sincerely wish the museum to become what it is not now, an experience that captures the viewer."
"It is a nice architecture building worth for photography. I visited the Singapore history section, good information but found the lighting on the exhibits were too dimmed and difficult to read the texts. Ratio of eating places versus exhibits seem a little high as compared to other museums."
We usually love museums. But this was boring and basic! Firstly you line up to buy a ticket but you can not see the prices until you get to the desk. This wastes people time as no one is prepared. They layout is not great. You enter the first level and follow that floor plan around then you go upstairs to the second level only to end up back on the first floor in the first exhibition you started with and then you have to re exit that one and go back upstairs to continue. If you knew about this you would start right at the top and work your way down.Personally we learnt and appreciated more of Singapore history at our tourist attractions.What was great was the architecture of the building. Stunning! That gets 10/10!The cafe there was ridiculous. We waiting for 15 minutes at our table and got ignored so we decided to get up and order. Only to be told we had to sit down for our order to be taken. So we sat down for a further 15 minutes. Didn't get served so we left.If you had children you will be very sorry you take them here! They will be bored to death
The museum building itself is beautiful and clean. Location is easy to access.They do bring some FREE events however they keep charging a little things if they can.Foreigner residents are kept charged while all Singaporean can be free which is not a nice concepts. They keep forgetting many foreigners are supporting this country and should be treated fairly.Children's weeks events used to be more attractions and fun but it is deteriorating and not fun anymore. I do not know why authorities would not put more effort for such events to motivate children's artistic senses and curiosities.I wish more improvements and efforts.
"As a young city, Singapore does not have much of a historical heritage to offer in her museums. The architectural style of this building can be quite impressive, but not really its contents."
Some of the spaces were great but things like the Occupation exhibition felt very superficial. Too little information.
The title says it all. I'm disappointed. There's nothimg much interesting except the video footage of Lee Kuan Yew. 20SGD is not worth it.
"This was a poor museum. It's very clean and well kept, however I thought the museum was not very good value for money at all. We payed $10 Singapore dollars each to get in and, frankly, the museum wasn't up to par to most FREE museums I've been too!Completely overrated. It has 4 floors - a basement level, level 1, 2 and 3. Out of these 4 floors, 2 of them weren't even open for us to see and explore. Waste of time and money"
"Please note this is not a review for the museum as a whole but a warning to those thinking of buying a ticket to the Treasure of the British Museum. I would expect for the price that there would be a whole floor of exhibits. Instead it was 6 rooms of rather pedantic items. Living in Canada, I've seen great West Coast carvings and I've been lucky enough to see lots of Egyptian, Middle Eastern and South American treasures. The only thing that caught my eye was the Lewis ivory chess pieces and they only had TWO!If this is your first museum visit, you may enjoy it, but if you've been to any museum at all, then this exhibit is profoundly disappointing.The curator also didn't seem to have an overarching theme or idea outside of showcasing different parts of the world."
Paid an extortionate amount to see an exhibition of stuff I know well from the British Museum.Sadly the other exhibits were more stuff I have seen on my world travels. Nothing exciting and nothing much about Singapore.The only really good thing is the actual building itself.
"Its latest revamp was a downright disappointment to me as a Singaporean!It is now more cramped and messy.It stopped short of surprises when it gave me a decade ago when it re-opened......the mood in appreciating historical artefacts is not apparent due to the latest way of cramping all materials into limited space!Sadly, it loses all its charm into exploring Singapore's past. (Understanding Singapore's past with no depth is the best it can do now)"
"Closed exhibits possibly bad timing, what was there was pretty good. Very small museum realistically."
Museum might be fine but the service was terrible. We were ignored at the ticket desk and were eventually told the museum would be closing in 30 minutes. Very rude staff.
"Visited this during the 50 th Singapore celebrations and it was very busy.the exhibitions were quite informative but quite small.there were several activities for children ,hat making and wood printing and an activity area ,but we were disappointed that there was so little to learn about the history of Singapore.That said we had a delicious lunch in their restaurant !"
I'm not making it up! Both the History gallery and The Living Galleries were closed on the day of our visit. A museum disconnected from the notion that 'visitor experience' is important?The exhibition we did see was a rather 'state biased' account of Malaysia's history which was clumsily censored and ended in the 1980s.
"The basic museum is free, and that's a good thing because it offers almost nothing to see. However, a special exhibit ""700 Years of Singapore"" was definitely worthwhile and worth the nominal entrance fee. Otherwise, calling this a ""National Museum"" is a bit of a stretch - on view was a love-piece memorial to the late ruler Lee Kuan Yew, and an insubstantial exposition on the historical role of women in Singaporean society. In such a formidable, historical building, there should be a permanent, much more authoritative and substantial exhibit on Singaporean history. Gift shop felt like a political-party-bookstore + a few nicknacks. On the plus side, there is excellent air conditioning throughout the building, and the cafÃ© has a nice menu and very friendly, attentive staff."
"Like most of Singapore at present - it was under construction in preparation for the 50th Anniversary of Singapore's Independence. Obviously this is an important time in the history of Singapore, however it was a shame to visit the national museum to be told that ALL permanent exhibitions are closed for renovation. I have never been to a national museum that cannot offer anything! Such a shame because the building is wonderful inside and out and I wish I could have spent more time there."
Five of us made our way to the place only to be told there was one exibition open the rest of the place under renovation. They still charged us the $6 per person to see Singaporean History which was about 40 minutes long. Looks like the place is kept open to get people into the restaurant that operates in the building but no real museum value
"The museeum itself its well appointed and very well kept, unfortunately the exhibits are simple and lack the deep research I was looking for.I got the gist of the Singapore history and foundation but, I ended up with the idea that they really don't know much about the early settlements."
"Went there to learn some history about Singapore, and there was only 1 exhibit open. I learnt about the history of Singapore which was interesting, but unless you check ahead of time to see if exhibits are open, it's not worth your money. Most things were closed and under construction, so it was a waste of a day. The building itself is beautiful so that was a plus side, but otherwise, just walk up to Fort Canning and learn the same things."
"Only the Singapore 700 exhibition was available to see and it was unfortunately rather ordinary, nothing special. Even with some other exhibitions available, I doubt that we would come to visit again. Usually in a museum, you have museum staff walking around and informing the visitors about certain exhibition items and telling stories about the museum, however, the only staff we saw was busy talking to each other and playing with their phones. disappointing."
"Our rating is based on the lovely building since that was all we managed to see. All the free galleries are closed for refurbishment. We went to the visitor information desk and that was also closed. Not very helpful. All that was open was the paid exhibition and, of course, the gift shop. The paid exhibit wasn't expensive but we were put off by the experience and decided not to bother."
"We have to say, we took a free docent led tour of the history exhibition and left early. Frequently, there were not artifacts presented, but representations of items -- long poles representing mangroves, fake rocks, etc. It's not that the facts weren't interesting, it's just that it could have been presented in a better manner."
"i took the taxi to get there, full of passion. but i only found that the 1st and 3rd floor has nothing to visit, and half of the 2nd floor was doing a Gallery which was not free, and other half was sealed for TV shooting. After 15 mins wandering, i chose leaving this so called ""Museum""."
I had been to many musuem around the world and i would say this musuem wasnt really that fantastic. Quite limited display...maybe if you do not compare it with musuems in other country then this would be ok. Must be our expectation level was being raised beforehand.
"A very disappointing visit. We arrived with enthusiasm, expecting a lot, and receiving very little. The most interesting exhibitions were the food and clothing production. The building is huge but has so little in it. There is no atmosphere. I expected the sounds,sights and smells of Singapore. To be transported to the invasion of Singapore with the fear and panic. It was so bland. A pity as there is so much history to work with."
"After visiting many of Singapore's attractions we had high hopes for the museum. The building was huge, but empty! There was vast open spaces of nothing! Disappointed we went into the main exhibition and were given head phones and an electronic device. The exhibition was disjointed and often hard to follow and offered no written explanation for the item you were looking at. The audio was usually a voice pretending to be someone who would have used the item, but it often left you none the wiser as to what the item is or the history of it. The audio for each item/area was often long winded and hard to stay focused. We left with no real understanding of the history of Singapore. Simple written information was needed, and the audio should have been used to enhance the information, not the only information source. Great idea, but needs work!"
"I have a serious problem with the presentation style of the museum. This is all for kids and teenagers who supplement school lessons with a museum visit. All the presentation is based around individual stories; when I attempt to learn country's history I want facts. Preferably in chronological order. It does not help that all these stories take up so much time on the audio guide that its charge does not last for the whole visit. There are interesting exhibits but the presentation makes it nearly impossible to get a coherent picture. I found the ""food gallery"" nearly the only informative part of the museum."
"there really isn't much to tell. It's definitely not something I would recommend for someone staying in Singapore for a couple of days. It's dark, lacking basic information boards (guess you would have to go around with one of those tablets to get any information) and there's anoying music everywhere!you have to pay a small entry fee if you're not Singaporean."
Very average museum and very few things to see and only good thing is that its very near to MRT.There is not much to seeBELOW AVERAGE.
"This museum assumes you have masses of time to spend - they give you an audio to go with the displays, and each piece of commentary is very long. There is no choice to read the information instead. It makes it hard to follow the simple chronology of the history of Singapore. I don't recommend unless you plan on spending a day here."
"Simply awful. Some distinctly uninteresting galleries devoted to items of (at best) marginal interest - the history of satay vendors in Singapore, anyone? - and then, if you manage to find the ""History"" part, an audio-guided, multimedia tour clearly aimed at people who can't actually focus on printed text. If your audioguide doesn't work - both of the ones I tried didn't - you've had it. If you like being incessantly bombarded with sights and sounds and colours then you will love it. If you like reading and learning about history, forget it. They ought to rename it ""The Singapore Experience"" and include a little 3D rollercoaster ride to complete the feel."
"This could be a nice museum, but the audio-guide spoils it all. There are no descriptions at the items on display, you always have to type the item's number into the mini-computer, then read on the mini-display. The audio is read out very slowly so you have to be very, very patient if you want to hear it all. You could easily see the full exhibition in 2-3 hours but with the audio guide it will take at least 4-5 hours. If you do not hear well or do not understand english very well you are lost completly. There are many better things to do in the wonderful city of Singapore."
"Singapore may be a young nation with little recorded history pre-British Empire, but places like the Peranakan Museum and Fort Canning bring it to life extremely well. The National Museum for some reason just doesn't.The displays are pretty lacklustre, there's a lot of wasted space and although the building is attractive, if you're expecting something of the quality of the V&A or New York's Met, you're going to be very disappointed."
Not impressed with the arts here -- for such a building the quality of displays was a waste of time and space unless I missed something in one of the many corridors and rooms.
The building is nice....and that is almost it. The different gallery are really small and we don't learn much about Singapore history
"I have to admit that they have been surprisingly effective in exploiting and valorizing what they have. Still, in the end you don't see anything really impressive. Even though it's a fairly new state I expected something more in the Historical Gallery. Honestly if you have few days to visit Singapore there are much more interesting things to do."
Pretty small museum which only proves the point that Singapore hasn't got much of a history.
"There are much more interesting places in Singapore, do not waste you time in a weak museum like this, building is worth to mention only"
"i was so looking forward to visiting this museum, but what a huge let down, it is an incredible building both in terms of its victorian architecture and the dramatic, but sympathetic modern additions, however the curators have lost the plot. it is basically devoid of exhibits. it is as if there has been a deliberate attempt to deny the years of british occupation and influence and yet no attempt to supply current relevant exhibitions. one long room was occupied by nothing more than a car boot sale purporting to be art. it struck me how many staff were around and how bored and embarrassed they looked. maybe we were there at the wrong time, but frankly it was abysmal. my wifes head was aching after 45 minutes so we went out into the rain with great relief."
"I have a shock on all the compliments & reviews to this Museum before I start to write.Before I visit this musuem, I have visited few museums before, Malaysia -KL & Melacca, Louvre @ France, British Museum, Shanghai Museum, Taiwan Museum, etc.This is the most lousy Museum I have visited ever. It is a very small museum, the display items inside is very limited and what I can see is a lot of TV & banner, board with wording in the museum, the informations you should able to obtain in internet. What I can appreciate is only the nice hostorical building, the peace environment at the cafe.The worst case, I felt the lighting is very dark and the whole journey at the self service Audio Guide is like a MAZE. My kids age 3 & 6 is not really like the atmosphere inside. A lot of partition inside, turn here and there....It is not recomend to tourists who have the short trip in Singapore, you can find more about Singapore by visting China Town, syed alwi road for Malay & Indian Culture (the real place).As a F&E tourist, If you have more times, then it is a good visit for Understand the Singapore Culture.As for local residents, it good to visit as a peaceful day.As for kids below 6, not much they can appreciated from my personal experience."
"Very rude, principled staff at the box office, I arrived at 6 o'clock, the woman told me that the cash desk was closed at 6 o'clock and refused to sell me a ticket !!!"
Everyone should be in agreement: the place is not worth visitFour flights of empty space. A large old building with non informative bad signages. The attendants looked busy with hand held devices. This place is boring
"Take care of your belongings....my camera charge incl. battery was stolen in there while it was charging in the baselevel. Employees sent me through the museum, nobody seems to care about."
I have just been herded out of this place 20 minutes prior to closing.4 staff following me until I left.Incredibly uncomfortable for a solo female visitor. Don't come here alone and definitely don't try to stay until the end.Shame on you!
"Really more of a contemporary art gallery than a museum, we only spent a few minutes here before deciding it was not our type of museum, although others with different interests may enjoy it."
"I went to visit the museum and arrived at 6:05. I was informed that after 6:00, only Singapore residents are allowed in (for free). I graciously offered to pay, but they hid behind policy and refused to let me in. Open until 7:00???"
"No need to visit their as a Tourist. It will be complete wastage of money. If you are living in Singapore for long time , then you can visit. Apart from 2-3 items all bogus. You can see those in your house only. Like Black-White TV, Eveready Battery, old radio etc."
"Despite being more polite and quieter than other visitors. We were told that they could tell that we follow a ""Japanese"" culture and were not welcome here by the security, one of our goth friends was told that he looked like the ""devil"" and was not allowed to come in.However there was a very friendly staff member in the gallery whom explained the meanings and origins of the paintings to us, she was really nice and understanding, it improved the visit a lot for us. :)"
"Very rigid, receptionists, lackluster exhibitions, nothing international, expensive. Not worth the money"
"I didn't enjoy my visit to this museum much. You have to queue behind a pillar and can't see the prices and choices of ticket, so everyone has to work out at the desk what they want - would be better to have it displayed on the wall so you can decide while queueing. Then you would not spend 5 min in a queue to get your ticket.They could not explain why foreigners pay S$10 but singapore residents get in for free (a practice that I don't agree with).Some parts of singapore's history seem a bit glossed over - for example why they split with Malaysia got very little (almost no) mention. From what I read on wikipedia singapore was expelled from malaysia and that was certainly not mentioned.The building was nice though, with a modern annexe attached to the old building, a good example of how to make use of an old building."
"A big let down given all the hype. Kids were bored to death! Impressive exterior but felt ""hollow"" inside. Not a family type museum. No family friendly affordable restaurants either. The children's play area was pitiful. Should really learn from the more interesting Australian museums."
"The lighting of the exhibits is very poor, you can hardly see the items. The cards will describe features in the items that you can not see because the lighting is so bad. I am sure that the items are interesting and many are beautiful, but it was a struggle to see the detail in most of the items."
"It's fair to say that the museum was 'closed' when we visited: the main exhibitions are still closed till 19th Septmber 2015.I visited the museum a few years before, and decided to 'risk it' this time though I heard from a friend that the 'galleries' were closed. However I didn't expect it meant almost the whole museum was closed.It was disappointing to find very minimal display at the museum, and that the museum was almost 'closed'.The only open area to the public was a small section of the first floor, where Made in Singapore product exhibition was celebrated, and items made in Singapore (and Malaya) were on display. Text accompanied the exhibits so we got to appreciate the history of the items, and their links to the Singapore's history. Some of items might evoke your nostalgia.The Made in Singapore display was like a mini warehouse. That was all we saw at the museum."
Very disappointed that there is no warning that the musium is closed for major renovations till a date in September. We turned up to find there was nothing to see despite being told that there was a 'Made in Singapore' display which amounted to nothing much. A long trip for nothing surely the official web site could warn vistors that they are closed
We turned up to look at singapore's best museum yesterday. In one lobby there was some boxes displaying local products but everything else was closed. It appears the museum is closed for renovation. It baffles me first why this would be done during peak holiday season and secondly why all galleries need to be done at the same time.
"Very large and attractive building from the outside consisting of 4 floors. The top floor is empty except for a classroom sized room for small kids to play in. The next floor down is for special exhibits etc. The next floor down consists of the permanent exhibition which is under renovation. The bottom floor has restaurants and the basement I'd also for special exhibits. A large building with a lot of empty space for nothing. If you approach the building from the Fort Canning side, it is a nightmare trying to get find anything as there are no signs. You end up spending 10 minutes just to find the ticket counter located at the front of the building. Don't ask the attendants because they will send you first to level 1, then to the basement and then back to level 1 again. For a first world country with an amazing history, the national museum is extremely poor, amateurish and empty."
Very few areas of the building were open. This was not advertised in advance. Only the history of singapore and a photo exhibit. History of Singapore was stretched out with few really interesting items. Way too long. Audio on device would not sync on many exhibits. The building itself is magnificent. More a mausoleum than a museum.
"As a Westerner/ foreigner, I was shocked how this museum tip-toed around huge historical events like the mass killing of ethnic Chinese men in Singapore during World War II. As if they were asking the Japanese embassy for approval?!The fashion exhibit allocated space and created highlights that indicated the museum was proud about the dominance of Western fashion over traditional clothing after World War II.A far more interesting development a decade later in fashion -- the government's policies to force men to keep short hair and avoid hippie fashion -- were minimized in a corner but at least they were displayed.Overall, this museum is more about national pride and collective identity, not so much about history."
"Most of the exhibition rooms were closed, the Singapore History Gallery is poorly lit and without a guide or tablet little sense can be made of the items viewed, we found it impossible to get any ""feel"" for the Gallery, when coming down the ramp ....around and around with nothing to see, the link from the video start to the gallery is lost.Strange place ?"
"This museum is a great place. I encountered the officiousness that seems too persavive amonst the new immigrants to Singapore. I wasn't allowed to move through until the lady handing out the interactive handsets had finished with her group. The guy just monstered over me as iff I was going to walk through anyway, probably because others have because of the silliness of this rule.That aside the interactive hand set was a bit of a joke. Why they needed to reinvent the way a museum works I don't know because the handset was just foollishness gone mad.The museum was great and looked very interesting but the laziness of not putting signs up explaining the exhibits spoilt it all."
We had a very nice time experience all this place had to offer. Many different species. Informative and helpful staff. Def need to make time to walk around gardens after to get full experience
"If you have the time make this a must visit of your travel in singapore, the variety of orcvhids is amazing!"
"A themed garden within the Garden. Set within the Singapore Botanic Gardens, it's a special themed area focused on the National Flower, Orchids.Here, one will find a wide variety of Orchid species as well as those named after celebrities and Heads of State.It was free when I visited (due to COVID I suppose) but it did look like they used to charge for entry (there was a ticketing counter and turnstiles)."
I like flowers and I got to admit that the National Orchid Garden is a gd choice for anyone wild about petals. The place is filled with wonderful orchids.
Has to be seen to be believed. Absolutely one of the best public gardens in the world. Well maintained and beautifully manicured. We spent twice as much time as we had planned. You could spend a relaxing day if you had the time.
This is a must see in Singapore. The collections of orchids are out of the world. So many different vibrant colors. Definitely a must!
"This is one of my girlfriends favourite places, so we come here often. This is helped with the free entry. The orchid display is her favourite part. I just like the peace and tranquillity."
It smells so good and ambience is amazing! I like photography so I go there time to time alone or with friends!Good vibes and great times!see you next time!
"It was quite warm the day we visited. The collection is incredible,all beautifully landscaped to show to best advantage. A delightful way to spend a morning or afternoon."
"If you like orchids this is a must. The way the orchids are arranged is quite amazing. So many different shapes, colours and sizes."
"Wow - what a collection of orchids. The entrance area is very impressive by itself and draws you in. There are many walk ways and areas once inside for you to see the variety of orchids.I was surprised to see so many in individual pots, and then placed around the gardens. I would have though they could have been in the ground itself to create the displays.It was lovely to see and another Singapore must see! Easily reached via the MRT"
"We loved spending the day here admiring the beautiful flowers. The orchids and other flora were spectacular! It was very hot and humid (like all of Singapore!), so dress accordingly. It's a little hilly, but on paths, so walking shoes are best (not sandals)."
The Orchid Gardens inside the Botanical Gardens are so well maintained and so pretty. You can get so many good photos of the Orchids. It was also free to enter when I visited (for students) which was much appreciated.
"Like any all-day breakfast, Singapore's Botanic Gardens are always worth a visit. I like to visit outside of concert hours as there are just less phones and cameras about. But for the best experience, I would recommend an early start or near closing hours so you can enjoy the cooler air and soak in the greenery and beautiful orchids. The National Orchid Garden is itself worth the ticket as it features some of Singapore's finest creations. Included the Vanda Miss Joaquim, this hybrid from 1893 was crowned as Singapore's national flower in 1981. Other celebrity orchids worth a mention are Elton John, Princess Dianna, Jackie Chan and Nelson Mandela. I ignore the names myself and just try and soak in the curated beauty of these gardens at the slowest pace possible."
Such an exciting experience for the whole family. If you go to Singapore you must go to the orchid gardens. The gardens are filled with chirping birds and gorgeous nature.
We took an early morning amble through these beautiful gardens. At every turn there were new sights to delight. A perfect gentle start to a short stopover whilst we were somewhat sleep-deprived. If you like orchids you are spoilt for choice and there are numerous photo opportunities.
The colors were vibrant and fresh. Flower people will love this Botanical Garden. Every extra clean and tide as usual for Singapore.
The Orchid Garden is a phenomena. The plants are quite staggering in their intensity of colours. If you like orchids then this place is a must see. Clever planting ensures a view of quality at every turn
"A MUST see, absolutely beautiful, I never realized how many variety's there were. Plan on at least and hour, and if your a photographer, even a little longer,"
"Wow, these orchids were amazing. The colours and displays were out of this world. I didn't know they came in so many sizes or colours. Absolutely beautiful."
The National Orchid Garden is inside the Botanical Garden and is a complete oasis of colour and beauty. There are a few signed spots recommending the backdrop for photos and all the paths have twists and turns that reveal more wonderful blooms. The gift shop is small but interesting and just outside there are two restaurants. Discount for visitors over 60 but even so the admission is only S$5 and so worth the visit.
"For me the Botanic Garden is World Class Best; however, the best part of it is the Orchid Garden. It does cost slightly more to visit, but when the rest of the garden is free, this is still worth the cost. The diversity of orchids is simply amazing, almost as incredible as the quantity of orchid's blooming. Singapore is that rare sweet spot in Botany were you can have world class quality with world class quantity. That is what is simply incredible here. You absolutely have to see the Botanic Gardens and while there you MUST SEE Orchid Garden. It is incredible and neither words or pictures will do it justice."
"This is a really beautiful orchid garden, I've never seen so many orchids or so many varieties in one place. There's a small entry fee of S$5 per person but it was completely worth it."
The National Orchid garden is full of wonderful and exciting varieties of orchids to view and marvel. The colors are intense and there are many different varieties on display.
Seeing all these flowers outdoor is something that I could not imagine in Europe.It was so hot with high humidity but to walk around and see all the different type of orchids is what you should do if you visit Singapore.
"OMG! If you are in Singapore, you MUST visit this amazing garden! You will find there thousands of orchids, different shapes and colors."
Go to the Botanical Gardens and there you'll find the Orchard Garden. I never knew there were so many varieties of Orchids. Lots of seating areas to admire the scenery or to rest up. Well worth a visit.
I have been here at least three times and am always pleased! So many lovely flowers and a nice path to walk along.
"A must to visit when you visit Botanical Garden for the first time, spare at least 2 hours in the park at least, you get to enjoy various species of orchids in the national orchid garden and big park to visit at the Botanic Garden too with many plants, trees, flowers, lakes, animals, etc , you will enjoy it thoroughly with no rush of time"
"We went first thing - before it got too hot. Beautiful place for a stroll, the orchids are beautiful and it was very cheap to access $3? The gardens around the Orchid garden are beautiful also and a lovely place for an alfresco lunch. I would certainly visit again without hesitation. Nice contrast to the hustle and bustle of Singapore itself."
Beautiful park with stunning flowers trees and shrubs . Take your time and relax in this wonderful oasis in the city
Very hot and humid but well worth the effort. The orchids are maintained in peak condition so there is always something to see.
"Had a trip up here. Just out of the busiest areas of town, a real haven of peace and tranquility.Very well kept gardens packed with exotic plants and flowers. Some hills so take some water as its steamy hot. The mist garden was very nice!"
"I am a huge orchid fan, I absolutely loved my visit here. If you are an orchid lover don't miss this enchanting place. I also did the Gardens by the Bay and was wondering if this would be anti climatic for me; I was in awe. Go go go."
"This is the only part of the Botanic Gardens which has an entry fee and it is well worth paying the nominal fee to experience the vast array of orchids. There are many paths meandering through the Orchid Garden, each one lined with orchids of every colour, size and description."
It was a good experience on a Sunday when we were pleasantly surprised that admission was free for Singaporeans for then. This was our 2nd visit and will be back again.
"an uncomparable experience: just wander around, stop, enjoy the incredible beauty of these blossoms..."
"Great to see families picnicking, walking dogs (all on leads), joggers and fitness people.The gardens themselves are huge.The orchids have every colour, size and shape imaginable.As a photographer the orchids were spectacular."
"I'm not really into flowers and gardens, but this was beautiful. A real gem. Pleasant Sunday stroll. Will return."
"We took a city tour and spend only a short time in the garden . It was absolutely beautiful We strolled through the gardens and couldn't believe the amount of different orchids there are. the displays were stunning. There is also a VIP section with orchids that have been named after a celebrity, there was a beautiful white orchid dedicated to Princess Diana. We could have spent a whole day there going through this part and also the botanic garden as a whole. Lovely, lovely, lovely Definitely would recommend a visit"
If you love orchids then this is the place for you. There is a charge to enter but if you're over 60yo it's only a dollar. Amazing.The garden is very well maintained and it is apparent that 'replanting' occurs fairly regularly. The variety and colour of the flowers is wonderful. Lots of paths lead one through the various sections of the garden.Well worth a visit. Lots of photo ops as well.
"This really is a beautiful garden to visit.Full of beautiful Orchids and so well kept by the numerous staff on duty, meticulously attending to the delicate blooms.A real treat for garden and flower lovers.Highly recommended!"
The Orchid garden is amazing. If you like your flowers then a visit here will fill your heart with joy. The size and the coulours of the orchids will amaze you. We came on the hop on bus verry easy to do the gardens are always open.
"Well worth the schlep, the MRT or a Tax Ride to the entry- cost-free Botanical Gardens and pay the $5 extra to go into this self-contained garden. ($1 if yiu are 60 or over...lucky me!).For a Brit, it is wonderful to see such exotic plants flourishing outside."
Wonderful presentation of glorious orchids in a great setting. Beautifully laid out. Good gift shop.
This is probably the best orchid garden in the world. Great range of orchids in all the colours you can imagine. You do pay but it is excellent value.
The walk around the Orchid Garden was amazing. The variety of flowers is astounding. It was extremely hot drying our visit but there were covered areas to sit.Definitely worth visiting.
"The botanic gardens themselves are very pleasant, but within them is a standout attraction containing hundreds of stunning orchids. The variety of colours and shapes was incredible, and they were all in such perfect condition. I took dozens of pictures, and now I have to decide which ones to display... which is a hard choice."
Wonderfully laid out and (for Singapore) inexpensive and a great way to spend the day surrounded by nature's beauty
"Well worth the minor entry fee, so many paths with more gorgeous orchids at every turn. Some nice seating to enjoy the peace."
"National Orchid Garden is a part of the Big Botanical Garden. There is a separate gate for National Orchid Garden , try to explore a bit and get into the garden through that dedicated gate. By doing so you will save time and spend more and more time in Orchid garden. There are 1000s of species of Orchid flowers. The best time to visit this place is morning in my opinion. You have to pay for a nominal ticket . There are lots of beautiful spots for Photography . There are lots of sights where you can sit and enjoy the beauty of nature."
Wonderful selection of orchids with names of celebrities as well. Free entry for all Singapore citizens and SPRs.
"Only costs $5 to get in $1 if you are over 60, a Beautiful place to visit so many amazing Orchids - situated in the Botanical gardens."
Houses endeared rare plant species and beautiful orchids inside the premise. Very vast area and requires time to Roam around.
The Orchid Garden is a must-see experience at the Botanical Garden and costs a paltry $5/adult. The range and variety of orchids here are truly breathtaking. I don't have very much interest in flowers generally but was completely enthralled the whole time I was there.
"I spent an afternoon here and loved it. The gardens were amazing. The orchids were beautiful. There were several areas for photo taking, and lots of places to sit and relax."
"A paid attraction inside the Singapore Botanic Gardens, it is a cheerful place, the blooms are attractive, neatly organised and make for a good 2-3 hour outing, or more depending on your walking ability and the weather."
beautiful Orchid garden - nice grounds - best few dollars spent in Singapore - pls note that part is temporary closed for renovations.
"At some point everyone should visit the Orchid Garden, preferably on a day when it's not too hot and humid to make it easier walking throughout the vast areal."
"this is truely an amazing place to visit, the garden was originally a specialist test area for hybrid wheat, barley and maze. when japan invaded the English Science team remained working on genetic modification of cereal crops. this was of great interest to japan as it would be helpful in feeding their army, that part of the history. the blooms and the scents from the different plants where mind blowing, a must if you can"
"Absolutely stunning , beautiful place . Various interesting themes and hills and walking routes . VIP orchid area had orchid named after foreign dignitaries. There were steps and hills , so it's not suited for people with walking difficulties , unfortunately."
Lovely diversion on a beautiful morning. Never knew so many existed entry only $1 each for over 60's. Everywhere so we'll tended endless photo opportunities
"You could easily spend a day or more in the most beautiful gardens you will ever see. It's open from 5am, I suggest you get there early to avoid the heat of the day."
Beautiful gardens set inside botanical gardens with so many varieties of orchids well worth a visit! Only 5 SGD entrance fee.
"Great place to visit.The MRT takes you right to the entry gate.The Orchid garden is quite a walk from the entry,make sure you take a bottle of water.Being Seniors we were given admission at the cost of $1;00Singapore.The Orchids were in full bloom and I was quite taken with the different species of plants on display.Well worth the the time spent here."
Absolutely beautiful. Can't recommend highly enough. I'd love to see what the new section which is nearly finished will be like.
As someone who has a family history with orchids this place was fascinating to me. The stories behind the flowers are good to hear and our guide was full of information. Definitely worth a visit if you are interested in flowers.
"This is really a beautiful and complete Orchid Garden. The trail around the garden is well designed. There are also sculptures amidst the Orchid arrangement. Every area in the park, however little, are meticulously designed and manicured to provide a good visual display. Overwhelming...."
"We human can be so creative and liver such architectural creations that stun the world , here is one of them , what an amazing conception , an amazing amount of plants , trees and shrubs in a unique setting ."
"Such beautiful specimens all well looked after, splendid colours and specimens, take a camera to capture them all"
"If you like orchids, and we do, this is a must. Well set out, superb displays and a very tranquil setting."
Pay the $5 when you are at the (free) botanic garden to visit the orchid garden. It's spectacular. You will not regret the visit.
"The Orchid Garden is situated inside of the botanical gardens. Entrance to the botanical gardens is free however you pay SG $5 to get into this beautifully manicured garden with archways which create nice vistas. There's a collection of orchids that is very pleasing to the lover of orchids. The botanical gardens which are a world heritage site, are accessible by both train (mrt) and bus and good directions within the botanic gardens that point to the Orchid garden. A lovely shop at the exit allows you to take home some Orchid memorabilia."
This should not be missed. Best Orchid display in the world. Very easy walk. If you're a photographer this place is haven.
"The National Orchid Garden is located in the Botanical Gardens. While there is no charge to enter the UNESCO World Heritage Site, there is a fee to see the National Orchid Garden. It was quite reasonable $5 for adults/Seniors, $1 for Students and Free for Children under 12. ' 'The National Orchid Garden is the product of the Botanical Gardens orchid breeding programmer which began in 1928. With over 1,000!species and 2,000 hybrids , the Garden boasts the largest display of orchids in the world. ( Brochure)We saw tiny tiny orchids that were beautiful!!!"
"Went here recently with friends ; and it was beautiful ; so many different orchids , loved this place ; I couldn't stop taking photos of all the beautiful orchids . Things were pretty expensive in the orchid gift shop , so I didn't buy anything although they had some nice things in there . But 1 idea if interested is take photos of the orchids and get them put on to a canvas when you get home"
"So many beautiful orchids, incredible colors, shapes, sizes, just wonderful! It's huge so allow yourself plenty of time. There are orchids created for foreign dignitaries, actors, singers, etc. You can walk around for hours."
"I did not expect the size, the range, the colours and the sheer joy of being able to wander and rest in all manner of fragrant spots. Truly an amazing experience and at a cost for a senior of a tiny amount."
I'm not a huge flower fan but this was truly beautiful and well worth the visit. massive variety of orchids and some very impressive displays but also a very tranquil place to spend some time.
"Well worth the visit. Not easy for those with walking difficulties but and, I would imagine, impossible for those in a wheelchair. Forgive me if I am wrong. Beautiful orchids."
"Visited National Orchid a Garden last week. Absolutely gorgeous. Thousands of orchids of many different varieties. Beautifully displayed. The area with orchids named for visiting dignitaries was unfortunately closed for maintenance, but everything else was spectacular. A MUST SEE."
"If you're into orchids this is the top of the list of place to see them. Varieties, colors and designed garden layouts. All the best. The paths through the gardens were broken into categories. All were great"
We visited this garden on a city tour of Singapore but only had 45 minutes there. A good 5 hours would be needed to view the orchid gardens and botanic gardens. Would suggest you take a taxi from your hotel(very cheap) and do this as a separate trip.
Tucked away in the Botanic Gardens...just behind 'the clocks'. Small entrance fee but well worth it.I doubt you'll see a more beautiful orchid display anywhere. As flowers go they are just exquisite...and some are very different to the normal orchid plants sold at home.Dotted around are benches/seats/places to perch that they have labelled as perfect for photos. Cute idea! Certain nationalities made good use of them!ï¸The shop has truly beautiful souvenirs and gifts with the iconic orchids on.....I spent far too much. Refreshments are quite dear so bring plenty of water. A tiny bottle of peach water was Â£6! Lime lollies from the opposite kiosk were delicious!Visit early in the day...the humidity is intense there and you need to walk a long way to see all the surrounding botanic gardens.A 'must see' on your trip!
Only cost a $1 for entrance. You walk through the Singapore Botanic Gardens to get to the Orchid Garden. We took the SMRT from our Hotel on Orchard Road. It was a very enjoyable outing on a beautiful day.
"Embedded within the national botanical garden is the orchid garden. Given is uniqueness we didn't mind paying the entrance fee.Since 1859, enthusiasts have been cultivating, propagating, and inventing new hybrids of orchids. They've held their own space since 1928, and re displayed in their full splendour. The very design of these orchids is, one could say, 'hand-crafted' by the Gardens' horticultural staff, dedicated to bringing out the finest in any hybrid cross.With over 1000 species and 2000 hybrids on display, the splendour of these gorgeous blooms is absolutely a sight to behold at the National Orchid Garden."
"probably the only place in the world with thousands of different orchids. if i didn't see it, i would not have believed something like this existed"
"Coming in from Cambodia, we had nine hours to kill before returning to get our flight back home. I wanted to go and see the botanical gardens and especially the orchids. Actually my group wanted to see the other must-see in Singapore, the Gardens of the Bay but I wanted to that at night with the lighting on, so I went in alone. The time was short, so I had to hasten my visit a bit through the gardens to the orchids. This garden really is magnificently built and well tended. A part is being renovated so partly closed but still I wondered around in awe. A short visit, which I regretted a little bit, forI could wonder around the garden surrounding the orchids for at least half a day, had I been given the time."
"A must see. Millions of perfectly maintained orchids. The place is not overcrowded and the staff made it into a spectacular garden. Entry is 5sgd, but worth the money. Only thing check the weather don't go during the hot hours of the day or when it is about to rain. For the rest bring your camera!"
I don't know how they can afford to look after all this with such a tiny entrance fee (we are of the older generation admittedly) really well laid out and spent quite a bit in the shop having seen things not seen elsewhere in the city
Wonderful place to visit fantastic Orchids pleasant walks around the gardens a must when visiting Singapore
What a beautiful display of orchids wherever you looked the displays where stunning. We spent quite a time here just wondering around amazed at all the displays. It was very hot and humid and be sure to bring umbrella as it nearly always rains.
"Back after almost 40 years, it was still beautiful and interesting!Although I am not very interested in gardening, this is beautifull and verywell maintainded."
Simply fantastic and relaxing. Take the time to enjoy the scenery than to snap photos.Always visit this part whenever in the botanic gardens.
"My wife & I do love the orchids here such a huge range & so beautifully presented, just wish I could have mine growing so magnificently at home. Those who love beauty will love the National Orchid Garden"
"For a minimal fee, especially for locals, you get to see a huge variety of colorful orchids of various shapes and sizes. Quite an eye opening experience compared to the more spread out organisation outside."
"Had a fantastic time at the National Orchid Garden, a must see experience in Singapore. Wonderful display and affordable entry."
One of the most spectacular gardens on earth. Make sure to have brunch at the English-style restaurant beforehand.
"This is arguably one of my favourite destinations to visit in Singapore - walk around the outer-rim in a brisk walk for one hour and you have scenery, freshness, tropical and an inspirational exercise beyond any other venues in the city! Enjoy."
This seems to be the most popular place in Singapore Botanical Garden. There were many verities of orchids and they were well arranged/landscaped. We were little too late to get there as it was about 2km walk from Botanical Garden Mrt. One need at least 2 hrs to enjoy it without hurrying.
"We arrived here by the Yellow Line on the hop on hop off bus service, which takes you right inside the park.A short walk from the drop off took us to the Orchid section.Took about 45 minutes to get around.Beautiful flowers, we particularly enjoyed the VIP section with orchids dedicated to famous world figures"
"One of the most important garden in Singapore Botanic Gardens. You can see beautiful orchids inside, as well as the orchids selected by the world leaders and celebrities as well."
"One of the main reasone whay my and I decided to travel to Singapore was the Singapore Botanic Gardens.My wife know this place from a prior visit and was talking much about it whenever Singapore name was coming in any discussion.Once visiting this place I was understanding why she loves this garden.A tidy very clean garden clean as in many places in Singapore and what is more important will organised.The subtropical nature of the region help plants grow in perfect way and this help the management of the garden to lay the Orchid Garden.This section is laid in hill landscape and have different paths which let visitors explore the garden easily.What a person should have is an umbrella in order to stay for a longer time without forced to leave the garden due to rain fall, which happen so often usually in the afternoon."
"I have no knowledge of orchids, however, a really enjoyable experience & spent hours looking aroundThe flowers were getting past their best viewing period however, were still gloriousThe paths are fantastic & easy to access"
Located within the Botanic Gardens the National Orchid Garden is simply amazing. Hundreds of orchids on display most in full bloom. Admission is only a dollar for seniors - and admission to the wonderful Botanic Gardens is free.
i have been sto singapor before and never taken the time to visit the orchid centre in the botanical gardens - they really are beautiful and i shouldve done this earlier
A really lovely garden within a garden and the jewel of Singapore's Botanical Gardens. Well worth seeking out. We visited Singapore twice en route to/from NZ and this was joint best site/sight along with the Gardens By The Bay. The rest of the large gardens are worth seeing too.
"The National Orchid Garden is stunningly beautiful. If you are a flower Lover, it is a must see in Singapore"
"This place is absolutely breathtaking. The variety of orchids, the colors and the little gardens sparse throughout the park are a pleasure for the eyes. One could easily spend 2-3 hours walking and admiring the trees, plants and the queen of the garden: the orchids. Also, check out the gift shop. Very nice souvenirs. Not to be missed!"
"This place is amazing. It's beautiful, an orchid in every shape and colour possible in a setting that looks totally natural. Be warning you may get damp! We were in the area when the 'misting' was turned on!"
"A wonderful place to spend a leisurely few hours. The entrance to the Botanical Gardens are free but there is a small charge for the Orchid Garden which is a must. Be prepared for high humidity though. Cafe, restaurant and gift shop. The gardens can be reached by the hop on / hop off tour buses as well as cars and taxis."
Absolutely loved the Singapore Botanical Gardens--the admission is free. The $5 admission for the National Orchid Garden was very much worth it. Totally beautiful.
"The Orchid Garden is located within the national botanical gardens and it was simply stunning. Words fail me as I recall walking through beautiful paths with an endless number of blooming orchids. Well kept and well organized, this is a must see for any orchid fan. The greatest orchid collection I have ever seen."
"We went as part of a tour so only had half an hour, you can get around it in that but there was so much more we could have seen. The flowers are truly stunning and I would recommend this to anyone. So immaculately kept and set."
"Definitely visit The Botanic Gardens and the National Orchid Garden if you have time. The variety of sizes, colours and shapes is incredible. There are good facilities there too."
As neither of us are gardeners we wondered if it would be worth the visit but it certainly was.The specific Orchid Garden is extremely good and we never knew there are so many types of orchid.The rest of the Botanical gardens were great as well and we spent most of a day in there.
"The garden is huge and very well kept, and you will see ppl of all ages there, someone is running, walking, playing with kids, playing with their pets etc etc.The have a small lake/pond where there are fishes and tortoise also and you can feed them. The place is very clean and a perfect place to relax.It also has a couple of restaurants.No entry fee."
We spent a fair bit of time in the gardens. A lot to see and the orchids as well as other flowers are amazing. A very worthwhile place to visit. Seniors 60 and older pay $1.00 admission - $5.00 for the rest and we'll worth it.
"I like this place so much. The orchids are amazing, so I would highly recommend this treasure. Please visit."
"I have a pretty staid view of what orchids are, or at least I did until I visited here. The orchids are displayed in a garden surrounding (some are just in plant pots as only some of the collection are displayed at a time). There were so many, around 600 varieties and of course such colour and beauty the plants display. Great few hours and a real joy to behold."
"Perhaps the best attraction in Singapore ... very well preserved ... great organization ... amazing variety of Tropical botanic plants , flower etc ... what a gem to the city ... well done"
"We visited the Orchid gardens on our familiriation tour of SingaporeThis is well worth a visit the the gardens were absolutely outstanding,so many different and just breathtaking orchids plants"
"Not just orchids but all kinds of other flowers and trees. Well kept gardens, amazing displays. Was a surprise to find such a large green space in Singapore for such a reasonable price."
You pay a small surcharge to enter this area. There are some beautifully done small environments. Very nic.
We took my grandparents and children for an afternoon and everyone has a lovely time. Orchids are amazing with so many varieties. Lots of seats for resting. Interesting and well stocked gift shop. Cafe and restaurant for food at entrance.
Pay a small entrance fee and you'll be able to access this part of the botanic gardens. Bonus if you love flowers as the range here are pretty varied. Great photo spots too!
"Orchids are lovely, but several reconstruction areas. The extend of the variations and number of flowers displayed has reduced from my previous visit at the beginning of this year."
"At present, it is free entry to this National Orchid Gardens. Some area is still under construction but it is still a pleasant walk through to admire the beautiful orchids and plants in this garden.There is an outstanding arches of Golden Showers very popular for great photos. Both the Celebrity orchids and VIP orchids are worth looking at.Within this Orchid Garden is Burkill Hall which is a restored Anglo Malayan plantation house. It provides the perfect setting for weddings and special occasions and is available for booking."
"A thoroughly charming walk, with some lovely specimens on display. If you want a stress free stroll amongst well tended plants, with interesting paths to take - this is it!"
When arriving via MRT we were surprised by the size of the gardens. They are huge! Just take a nice reaxing walk through them and be surprised by how nice they are.
"The orchid garden is definitely worth visiting, such strange and beautiful flowers which flourish in the high humidity and equatorial climate of Singapore. We were lucky to have the place all to ourselves."
"I was visiting the Botanic Gardens and came across the orchid garden as I walked through the main garden.I did not go into the exhibit itself as there were plenty of orchids to look at outside the exhibit. I love orchids, such exotic flowers and there where so many colours, shapes and varieties to see.Spectacular, make sure you don't miss these gorgeous orchids while walking in the main garden."
If you like orchids this is the place to go. Seems like the place have recently been reconstructed and that there are more to come. Its worth coming here even if you don't bother with the rest of the botanical garden.
"If you are visiting the Botanic Gardens in Singapore, which are absolutely stunning by the way, you must complete the visit by entering the National Orchid Garden. Entry to Botanic Gardens is free, but to enter the Orchid Garden you need to pay $5 per person (price correct at the time I was there). It is well worth it. Inside the Orchid Garden it is much quieter, almost tranquil (because of the fee to get in), beautiful flowers and plants, little water displays and archways make peaceful and relaxing moods. Great to spend an hour or so to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Best time to go would be morning or late afternoon, middle of the day is usually just too hot. I gave 4 stars and not 5 because the area is small compared to other stately gardens I have been in and because of the heat I think there should be somewhere inside where you can buy cold drinks."
Very busy but well laid out and the orchids were beautiful. I suggest you also take the nearby rainforest walk for a bit of peach and quiet (and coolness)
"This is my second visit and it was just as beautiful even though it was a different time of the year. The orchids were in abundance. There are quite a few stairs but with a bit of map checking you can bypass these if stairs are a problem. There's a number of places to sit and enjoy/rest. Carry a drink though as the shop is at the entry. Only disappointment was that the greenhouses were closed for a rebuild and are not due to re-open until later in the year, although it looks like they'll be better than ever.The cost is minimal to enter but you can save a little by buying through different online sites. Be aware though that some sites make no provision for seniors or students so those tickets should be purchased at the gate ($1 SGD for seniors)."
"Although enclosed within the botanical gardens it is worth paying the modest entrance fee to have a look around the Orchid garden, which are perhaps even more beautiful and with many award winning and rare orchids (as you may expect)."
"Firstly, I love gardens! Rarely if ever disappointed when wandering amongst trees and flowers. The Singapore Botanic Gardens are no exception and it is worth paying to enter the Orchid Garden. A very special treat."
"This garden is inside the Singapore Botanical Garden. Entrance fee is S$5. It is a beautiful place, however, wish they will put more other orchids variety. There's only few common orchids variety in bloom. The place is well maintained. Worth the walk."
"There are many varieties, great if you love colours and flowers. In early February 2020, the cool air-con part is still under renovation, so it was quite hot. I prefer to cool down in the air-con room where other types of plants and flowers bloom."
Tranquil and beautiful place to spend a couple of hours. Free to go in and lots to see. The gardens are very well kept. We paid to visit the Orchid garden which was well worth it.
Well worth a visit despite a large section closed for redevelopment. Despite the glasshouses being closed off there is still plenty of beautiful orchids to see when you stroll around the outdoor gardens.
A little dissapointed because of the lack of blooms that were out. But at another time of year I am sure they would be brilliant.
We love this orchid garden with beautiful orchids. The only complaint we have is the signage is not clear and we were not sure if we missed any part of the garden because we kept walking around and back to where we began.
"I am an avid orchid fan, so might be a bit biased, but this place was a must for me - the Botanic Garden itself alone is worth visiting, but if you have the time pop in to the Orchid Garden, and check out the beauties"
Worth a visit if you are visiting the Botanic gardens. Great for children. Try to go in the morning when it is less crowded.
I've been to the Orchid Garden several times and I've not been disappointed but till recently.I recently visited the garden during the December holidays and admission was free for Singaporeans. I didnt see as many orchids and a good amount of the garden was closed for upgrading. I brought in a tourist with me during my visit. I recommended the trip to the garden and when I went there it was disappointing. They could have at least place a notice to say that the garden is undergoing renovations of sort. That way I might have given it a skip and visit the other parts of the Botanic Gardens. Also I am sure the flowers have decreased tremendously.
"In spite of the rain, the garden was very crowded. Harder for seniors to navigate; pick a time when a lot of people don't typically visit"
"This is a nice garden. Probably a must- visit of you're into orchids. Very cheap entry as well, so go for if you have the time."
"Not really a flower person, however the Orchid Garden is amazing, so many beautiful colours and well designed to make the most of it"
"Well worth the visit, some stunning displays. Make sure you take some water proofs because when it rains it drops it down and you are exposed in the garden"
Not many things to see in November 2019 (I came here for 2 times). But hope it will be great after upgraded
"This was a really tranquil part of the botanical gardens which did require a modest additional entrance fee - it was well worth it.There are many thousands of stunning orchids arranged in every way imaginable - lots of photo opportunities.Only negative was that part of the park is under renovation, it looks like this has been ongoing for some time. Sadly little thought has been given to the disabled access affected by the works, many ramps not open & little signage reflecting the current situation."
We went to visit the Botanical garden and one cannot miss the orchid garden when you go there. We found it a bit over manicured with lots of photo spots to make selfies
"It is free entry for students, Singaporeans, Permanent Residents and Work Permit Holders during the school holidays till 1/1/20.Pros :1) Beautifully display of many variety of tropical orchids.2) Garden was very well maintained.3) Many photo-shoot areas.4) Entrance fee is inexpensive for tourists.5) Serene environment during quiet times.Cons :1) Can be crowded during weekends.2) Certain section is cordoned off for renovation till end 2019.3) 30 mins. stroll from the MRT station.Will visit again. A must see if you visit the botanic gardens."
"The Orchid Garden in the Singapore Botanical garden is well worth the time, it is relaxing and inspiring. The variety and quality of these orchids is beyond description."
"I visited the National Orchid Garden with a friend this morning because the entry is free for Senior citizens till the end December 2019. As usual, the weather was hot and humid but the lovely orchids made up for the lack of a comfortable atmosphere. Lots of tourists were also enjoying the beautiful array and varieties of orchids displayed in the Garden."
So many flowers. This was a cool place that showcased all kinds of orchids. Neat little place to go spend some time while at the national botanical garden. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars for me was the lack of something real unique. Admission was only 5 sgd so it is a great deal.
"Impressive. Which I had more time to spend in the gardens. Just visited the Orchid Garden, but it is impressive. Beautiful gardens and flowers. Make time for rest of gardens"
Part of the garden under renovation so only about 50% is available. But as normal for Singapore after reopening the garden will be 6*
"Need to walk a while in the botanical gardens to reach the orchid gardens though, it's worth to see. I didn't know before that there was that much type of orchids"
"This garden have the most collection of orchids I had even seen. Orchids of different sizes , colours and smell."
"We only came across this when we visited the Botanic Gardens. What a great and amazing place, the variety and number of orchids on display was outstanding. For any body with green fingers it is well worth a visit."
"After taking the hop on hop off bus around the city, it took us to the gardens. We decided to have a look. The orchid garden was beautiful and had many photo opportunities. The weather was overcast but it still made for a nice time. Both of us did get a little bored with the flowers after about half way, but we still appreciated it. We saw a few wildlife which were interesting also. Worth the entry fee in our opinion, but it's a once of thing for us."
Great to get discounted senior entry! Flowers in outside gardens are magnificent. Currently the indoor areas are closed for renovation but this did not take away from the joy of walking through the gardens.
Bit disappointing to find nearly half the orchid garden closed for renovation. There was no information about this until you were in the garden. Very disappointing.
"Using the SRV was a breeze and it was the first time my family had come to the Nighy Safari together. It was a great experience and every staff we came across were friendly, professional and beyond helpful. We had come with my elderly grandmother in a wheelchair and the staff assisted with getting her on the tram ride. The tram is definitely a must-do!Special mention to Shu Wen from the souvenir shop who went the extra mile to assist me with a personal problem. Beyond grateful for her help."
"Brought our elderly parents for their first time to the night safari and it was a pleasant experience. Since the last time I went was more than a decade ago, we didn't realise there was a long queue and wait for the popular Creatures of the Night show. Seeing we were probably looking kind of lost and my mum's mobility challenges, an attentive staff, Damian came forth to help us and made recommendations for us to go on the tram ride first and come back for the next show. He kindly helped us to the priority queue for the tram ride and when we came back later for the show, directed us to where my mum could sit more comfortably as we waited for our turn. Kudos and thank you to Damian and the staff at the Night Safari for their excellent service, friendliness and helpfulness!"
Excellent Night.Staff handled the crowds well.The tram rides are a great way to get around.The trails were great to walk around too.
"The world's first nocturnal zoo, I was particularly excited about this one. I had read many online reviews about how busy it was and how the queues were ridiculous. When you enter the zoo you have the option to go around the zoo by foot or by tram, we chose by foot and we didn't see another person our entire time there!We had so much fun, the pathways were very dark and it felt very eerie at times. The animal enclosures are lit in a way that is meant to resemble moonlight as not to disturb nocturnal animals, and we found we were really able to see a lot of activity from animals that we're so used to seeing napping in a corner."
Had been to this place many times with kids with adults and every time is amazes me. One of the must thing to do while being in Singapore ... best part is Animals are well taken care by the zoo
Great time to visit. No crowds and safe distancing in place only downside is masks are mandatory all the time but it is for our safety! Great view of amazing animals roaming around at night and even touching distance (not recommended) while passing them on the tram ride. Walking paths meander through the park in dimly lit areas where you can see the animals in their nocturnal habitats. Really fun and kids loved it. Always come back and recommend to all visitors to Singapore.
Im going to the night safari is because of the discounted ticket prices. Booking the ticket online is way more convenient as you get to skip the queue. You can also get to buy the bundle with an affordable prices.
"The night Safari was relatively decent. The only animals that were able to roam on the road were deer which was ok. Other than that we were able to see lion, rhino, hippo and a tiger alone with some flamingos. In total the whole team ride lasted about 20 odd minutes."
"Last visited about 25 years ago when it open as the world's first night safari. No major recollection except being on the tram and a deer chased our tram at one part.Managed to spent a little bit more time here this time round and walked through 1 or 2 of the trails, I must say the trails are more interesting than the tram rides. If you can afford more time to walk, definitely take the trails as there are more interesting things to see. The trip was thoroughly interesting except for the fact that thunderstorm brought an unexpected end. Nice experience to see the animals active at night in person rather than on TV."
"Amazing experience! A very nicely set-up mainland safari trip. Got to see magnificent creatures of the wild. Great views from the tram and you can even walk around on different trails. Helpful staff to guide you around.If you are not a fan of mosquitoes, be sure to take some repellent or cover yourself.There is always that one clumsy tourist whose camera flashes in the darkness, even though you are strictly told to turn your flash off.Observer the natural beauty with your eyes, forget about your camera."
Night SAFARI has a very well structured train taking you through the park with right directions through recorded script sounds...(like at the right side at the left side)Almost every animal Visible from their designated plots.(you dont need to search for them)More than 30/40 Animals and its bright lighted and ofcourse the open train journey makes it even great
Very very different kind of experience! Super unique and I would recommend coming at least once! Interesting concept!
"Singapore has great animal parks, but the most unique and something you simply MUST SEE is the Night Safari. It really is the equivalent of the Zoo but a totally different experience. Most animals in zoos are nocturnal but you rarely get to see them at night. Night Safari is zoo experience that is only open at night. The park opens at twilight but quickly turns dark. It offers two great experiences, ride on a tram that winds through the park (some animal exhibits can only be seen by tram like the elephants) or the more adventurous walk along a path between exhibits at night. My wife and I really enjoyed the path and got to see numerous animals that you can only see at night. It was awesome to see the Fishing Cats, Asian otters, Leopards and Singapore natives Civet cat and Pangolin. We saw all 3 animal exhibits at the zoo, but this was a favorite because it was so unique. There is simply nothing like it.If you are combining with another park, you can come to the Night Safari and eat dinner before going in. There is also a sort of dance show before the park hopes that you can watch. In addition along the trail and in the Amphitheater, they do have animal shows that are both educational and entertaining. Again if you can only do one park, be sure to visit this one. The experience is that amazing."
"Visited the Night Safari in the middle of the Covid Outbreak. Good thing was that it was not crowded as I heard that during normal peak periods, it is really packed. Do buy your tickets online as the online prices are usually lower. Furthermore the ticket counter is located very far from the Night Safari Entrance which is rather ridiculous if you ask me. Do go as early as possible as I feel that you need minimally 3 hours to properly cover and appreciate the park without rushing through. Moreover the ticket prices are not cheap so you also want to maximise your value. It is a really unique and special experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone who comes to Singapore."
"I've visited the night safari before and i would say over the years there have been changes to the layout that makes it refreshing to visit again! Some interesting animals that i really enjoyed looking at include the Binturong, the flying squirrel and the Armadillo. The tram ticket was included in my visit so we were able to take a nice 45minutes tram ride, after walking along 2 trails. We visited on a sunday night so there weren't any lion and tiger feeding sessions, so if you'd like to catch those i recommend coming on a friday or saturday night."
"A very interesting visit. To arrive early is a plus, to spend more time with the animals. It makes necessary to eat something before the visit!"
one of my best experiences with animal in my entire life! the best part: feeling the deep vocation all the animal keepers prove. Really recommended.
"There are many amazing animals to see, lions, tigers. The car ride is very exciting. The zoo show is interesting."
Had an awesome time.Specially the trail.The tram ride was great.Lots of different animals in almost natural habitats.
The night Safari was amazing . This time also managed to see a show as well as do the tram ride and look around the eateries and generally such a relaxed atmosphere that is so calming !
"Very cooling at night. Love taking the tram and taking slow walks round the safari. Relaxing. We have been able to see most of the ""night"" animals. I'm a local. But will visit 1-2 times anually."
"It was a completely worthwhile visit. You should definitely not miss. I saw a lot of people leaving after the bus tour, please don't. Walk around the park, see the nightlife up close."
Thought it would be cheesy/just for kids but it was actually great. Go on an early slot! I was there from 8 until close and I wished I'd had more time.
"Never seen anything quite like this before! The animals seem to come right up to your tram, in the dark you can't see the ditch that lies between you and them! A tip - take a tour rather than make your own way there - that way you get priority access to the trams, we saw huge queues for those who were visiting under their own resources."
There were crowds of people. We were on a moving vehicle. I didn't see many animals but my wife spotted a few. I wouldn't go again.
I think it was a great experience and I recommend going there with your family. It is super fun and kind of scary especially when you see that their are only natural barriers around the enclosure. I really liked the varieties of animals. I recommend sitting on the outside of the tram because I remember the tapir walking up and touching me!
2nd time to visit. very good route design and service.My little boy likes this Zoo and all the animals.
"Night Safari is a separate facility from the Singapore Zoo, although it is adjacent to the zoo. It is set up for seeing animals that are more nocturnal and difficult to see in a normal zoo. Take the tram ride and then doing the walking paths to see other animals you can't see from the tram. Along with the zoo, this is something that should been experienced when in Singapore."
"The night safari is surprisingly kids-friendly. We took a shuttle to go around the night safari, after spending a day in the Singapore zoo"
"Take the tram for the quick overview and come back to the exhibits that you fancy later. Much cooler literally because it's only opened in the evenings (DUH), which is nice in Singapore's muggy weather.Dress light and wear insect repellant. Also do check the weather before making the trip, because you don't want to be caught out in heavy rain and poor visibility in the middle of the jungle."
This was a very different way to see a zoo via night hours. Felt very privileged to see the animals in their glory during darkness. We opted to see the Night Creatures show which didn't go too long but was interesting but not as interesting as there tram ride around a whole other region of the zoo not seen with normal zoo admission. The line up is crazy and can take a little while to get through so get in quick.
The night safari at Singapore is worth seeing. Only thing is that tickets needs to be booked in advance and it should be with tram car ride as it is next to impossible to walk the entire safari. The tram ride takes around 40 mts and the tickets for entry is at 19.15 and 20.15. Secondly a pick up and drop is required as it is some distance away and in the night buses might not be available . If you are in Singapore this place should be visited
"We came here after our trip to the zoo and weren't disappointed.We had the 7.15pm entry and headed straight to the Creatures of the Night show which was busy but good fun. We then did all of the walking tracks. At first we couldn't see anything so were worried we wouldn't get our money's worth but patience is a virtue! We saw nearly all the animals including elusive leopards, fishing cats and pangolins.Even though it is busy, I recommend the earlier sessions as everybody goes on the team first and you can get the walking trails to yourself."
"If you love animals or travelling with someone who does this is the experience for you!It's a 35-minute drive from orchard road and they are plenty of signs to make your experience stress free.I recommend going on the train ride the wait is worth it and to also experience the show in outdoor theatre as it is not only a way to learn but is funny and interesting watching the different types of animals.On the way, out make sure to wait in the taxi stand if your waiting for a 'taxi or grab' driver, where you got dropped off before is illegal to be picked up from as it creates traffic."
Reallly worthwhile trip from hotel via metro and shuttle bus. Caught the tram ride around the site followed by 10.30pm creature show which was great. Managed to get last shuttle bus and last metro then taxi back to hotel. Thoroughly enjoyable but the Rainforest Lumina was disappointing.
The night safari at Singapore Zoo was amazing!! Highly recommend it!! See I g all the animals in their natural nighttime habitats. We also did the Lumina Show at the zoo which was great!
We bought the 8.15pm tickets and after entering we were promptly told over the loud speaker as well as as we were moving through the ticketing gate that we could go a certain way to get on the tram or you could go another way if you wanted to walk around. We had a tired tween so we took the tram ride which was informative and maybe we were just lucky but we saw loads of animals. after the tram ride did it's circuit we then lined up for about 15 minutes for the night show. Fabulous. If you've been to a few zoo's it's not the absolute most awesome show I've seen but well worth it and I wouldn't suggest missing it. You could have then walked around again if you wanted to as the Zoo is open until very late but we left after the the once around tram ride and show.
"Absolutely love the night safari#1 Night Safari Tip - Go on a rainy weekday.Absolutely no queues to be seen (as not seen in photos). We were able to ride the tram numerous times without having to line up at all. Most of the trams weren't even half full.The cooler weather makes walking the trails and a pleasant overall experience.The animals were frisky and alert due to cooler weather as well.You must visit night safari when in Singapore, and like I said, choose a rainy weekday and enjoy the park without the queues.I'd also recommend doing the Night Safari on a seperate day to the zoo, especially if you have kids. You don't want to fatigued when visiting."
Really loved it here. Used the food court before going in which was good value and tasty. The land train around the zoo was great and saw most of the animals. This lasted about 30 minutes. Then walking around the zoo and having time to properly see the animals was great. At times a little freaky when hyenas disappear into the shadows not that far from you. Couldn't get into the creatures show as always fully booked and wasn't wasting 45 minutes queuing for it. We'll worth it.
"What fun, what spectacles, what beauty.Night Safari in Singapore is a must and quite famous, and we know why.In short, a Must."
"The night safari is very popular so do make sure you get there on time particularly for the shows as the weather can mean that shows can get cancelled. The show was good fun and team do a good job of talking about the animals.The safari ride was also enjoyable and we got to see many animals in the open, worth a visit!"
One of the best experiences to see animals at night with an amazing concept of travelling in trams which goes around the whole zoo. Lots of encounters and close ups with the animals. Amazing dining places and an excellent show called Creatures of the night which is a must watch. Night safari is one of the top best attractions in Singapore and is a must visit with friends family etc.
We went during the new year holidays with our kids aged less than 10 and they loved it. Me and my husband had done this earlier but it was worth doing it again because my kids just loved seeing the animals in the dark and the experience of going around in a jungle at night.. must do!!
"The night safari is well worth the queues,and the money. Forget all the top ten tips and just embrace the organised chaos. Like all things in nature the one thing that does spoil it is Man. Do the tram trip with your fellow humans and then avoid them where you can on the night trail- they just won't shut up! Loudly complaining that they can't see any animals- they are there, like me wishing for peace and quiet!"
"Everything so well organized, my kids and I are absolutely happy! Animals are so well taken care of. I wish every country would have similar parks... Singapore is the best place to have fun at :)"
"To reach the venue grab taxi .You get to see nocturnal animals...like otter, flying fox, etc. Book tickets for 7:15pm.reach the venue at 7pm sharp. 1st go for the creatures of the night show. Then get into the line for tram. Tram ride is for 45min. Then go for fishing cat trail walk (do not miss it) will see there pangolin, Armadillo, clouded Leopard etc.If you want you may spend the whole day by going to zoo during the day and night safari in the evening.Overall good experience. You are out around 10am. Board the bus to reach your hotel or nearest point to your stay, it will be difficult to get a taxi."
"an wonderful experience . well recommended for famiiies to enjoy , large crowds at 7.15 pm show , but the staff was excellent at organising the crowds , would recommend a later show time to avoid the crowds,"
"Having read other reviews, we weren't too sure what to expect but it was an amazing experience. We were lucky as we had a bright, calm night and so we saw all the animals. The tram ride was good to get bearings and to see the lions in particular which were beautiful. We saw the Asiatic and African lions and they were active and roaring and feeding. The Fishing Cat Trail was great - amazing just to be walking through a zoo at night. It was pretty quiet and we saw the leopards at incredibly close range. The mouse deer were gorgeous as was the fishing cat. We didn't see the shows as we wanted to prioritise seeing the animals as the children were tired. We didn't have to queue for anything including the tram but maybe that's because we went on a Monday evening. An amazing experience and would definitely recommend."
Great experience. We managed to see plenty of animals. Staff was helpful. The only drawback was that the Creatures of the Night show was cancelled due to the rain which was understandable as the weather was outside the Safari's control. Animals looked to be well looked after. A few food options but they are theme park prices.
"It is very interesting place, like most places in Singapore. Very informative to take the train first and then walk through the park. Most animals are active at night because it is not so hot.Be prepared to spend lots of time in long lines to get tickets, then to get to the point of entry. Arrive there an hour or two before the time you plan to get in. Tickets sold fast! Even if you buy tickets online ( like we did), you still need to get to the ticket booth to get the paper tickets. Remember that after midnight all public transportation is closed and only taxi is available ( double price after midnight) and it is long line for taxi. Enjoy the night safari."
"While booking night safari I was just so excited but I didn't find it as good as o expected it to be. It would good if travelling with children, I believe adults can simply ignore it."
"singapore night safari is an amazing place to be at. They take you in a tram to the tour of the jungle where you can see deers, hyenas , tigers. lions, elephants , african dogs ,bears etc After that you can go by foot to see fishing cat , porcupine, armadillo , ghariyal , cloudus leopard, ottters , flying fox , etc . The they animals are kept in their natural habitat will amaze you a lot"
This has to be an unmissable part of anyone's visit. Make sure you get there in time and watch the show in the amphitheater. The night setup of the safari gives you an authentic jungle feel and leave a lasting impression. Don't leave out on the tram ride. It covers a few exhibits you can't access on foot
"The night safari was a great experience. It was sort of weird in that it was billed as seeing the animals alive in their natural nocturnal environment, yet some of them were asleep. But it was interesting and fun and you didn't know what was around the corner. It could also be a little spooky wandering around the trails in the dark. It would be a great night out for the family."
"Saw a palm civet, flying fox, leopard cat, tiger, wallaby, cave, sugar glider, leopard gecko, armidilo.It was nice to see some animals which we had not seen before during this visit.Loved the cool evening...and the tram ride."
"Its been more than 10 year since my last visit but Night Safari is as good as before if not better. First, complement to their excellent customer service, I booked the ticket online for the visit on 27 Oct but due to the downpour on that day their customer service allow me to change the visting date not once but twice.We finally visited the place on 9 Nov, we booked 8 pm but due to huge crowd we can't even attend the 8.30 show. So we decided to walk the trail first, the fun start when everyone is trying to spot the animal in the dark. Back to the show place an hour later to catch the 9.30pm show, it is very entertaining and at same time educational. After that we move on to the fire show at the entrance, this one is definitely better than 10 years ago, it last for about 10 min. We move on the see the luminal forest, it is amazing, after that we go back to Night Safari again to catch the tram even it is already 11.15 pm but we are glad to do so as now you can easily see many big animals that we was unable to see earlier. We ended the trip at 12pm. Everyone is tire but really enjoy the trip."
"We would like to say how amazing & wonderful Emmy Mohamed Bin Nenpari and the jeep tour guide were. They were professional and very informative about the Night Zoo and made it a very special experience for us all as a family. Thank you very much Emmy with your genuine kindness shown to us, you were fantastic and we hope we will again visit the zoo soon. We would highly recommend a jeep tour rather than the train as it's quieter and the animals come towards you thinking we are going to feed them (they recognise the jeep as having Zookeepers ready to feed them).Is was almost like a real safari in the wilderness. Great memories"
"It was not an everyday experience to walk around in the zoo among all the different animals an be so close to them. The trails are well connected an it was really to find our way around. It was very exciting, a bit Jurassic Park-like. Highly recommended!"
A little bit like a Disney ride but seeing wild animals in their habitat at night was well worth the visit - a well organised trip - so pleased we did it
Loved the tram ride around the park. You are able to watch the animals up close and the best part of it is that the animals are not caged or fenced in. Nice cafes to have a meal when you arrive.
"We loved seeing all the animals, both on the tram and walking through the different sections. Watch out for the gharial!"
"Loved the fact that you did not see any fences on the safari, animals are well catered for. Queues were very long...."
"The zoo has evidently scheduled feedings so that the animals are in position for best observation, while still looking natural in their habitats. The 'friendly' species are even open-range, so that they completely surrounded the trolly as we passed. I have mixed feelings about zoos, but this one seems to have paired down the number of species, in order to serve as a sanctuary for the ones they have. Great for kids AND adults!"
"Brilliant, unique experience. You get a lot for your money and seen a lot of animals you would not usually see. Some of the animals are free roaming and you walk amongst them."
"We really enjoyed the night train at the Zoo last night in Singapore. We took the 815pm train which loaded quickly despite the fairly large queue. The animals were many and diverse with lions, tigers, deer of several types, hippos, rhinos, hyenas, elephants, tapirs and many more. Our Sunday night was fairly quiet apparently and a good night to go. Buy tickets online first for best access but we had no trouble really. Food options not fantastic - eat first or later. We have never had such a wonderful night time animal experience. The zoo is under major major renovation with multiple theme parks and hotel planned for the near future."
"The Night Safari offers a great opportunity to see animals in a different light- literally and figuratively! Nocturnal and semi-nocturnal animals are roaming in large enclosures- such as elephants, tigers and hippos!The entire experience was pleasant- well organised, staff were friendly and the park well kept ant tidy. I would recommend planning your time around the two main attractions- the Creatures of the Night Show and also the tram tour of the park. The show was excellently produced, with a great host and magnificent, intelligent creatures. We ended up walking all the trails to get a closer view of the animals- a circuit of the park took around 90 minutes.A highly recommended night out in Singapore."
This was a fabulous experience. The night safari is very unique...you see the noctornal animals in their natural habitats. Wonderfully conducted.
"As it was Diwali day we had a long queue may be 2 hrs. Also as it started raining the creatures of the night shows were cancelled. But we enjoyed the 20mins night safari ride thoroughly.The tram takes you close to animals like elephant (first time saw one with big long tusks), magnificent lion, hippos, rhino, deer species, wild boars, buffaloes, bear, hyena, wild dogs etc, was great experience for kids.Please note no flash light photography is allowed."
"My partner and I pre-booked night safari before we left for Singapore - and that did save waiting in line for tickets.The later you go the less crowds there are and lines for the bus tour and live show are smaller. Also with less people the animals are more likely to come out of hiding. We got there at around 8.30 and after 9.30 crowds were starting to dwindle. We got a cab to and from the safari. It was pretty straightforward.What I enjoyed most was the walking trails. They're short but you can go at your own place unlike with the bus, where you stop for 20 seconds and then move along.Also, a tip for other visitors PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR FLASH AND TORCH. They're nocturnal animals and sensitive to the light - why are you holding the light up in its face like you're interrogating the poor thing? Just rude."
"I was a bit sceptical before going there, but I have to admit the experience was awesome. We first went on the safari train and afterwards strolled the trails and saw a lot of animals including a few very rare ones."
Very unique experience! A little out of the way but definitely worth the trip. We were lucky to see the animals so active (heard they may be sleeping)
"The night animal show was brilliant, very informative. And then the ride around the park was great. Alot better than most zoos as the animals are very active so you get to have a really good look at the ones that usually ignore you in the daylight. Like the lions and tigers. And the work they do for conservation is amazing. Can't wait to come back to Singapore to go again."
Following the theme of Singapore's respect of animal space and habitats the Night Safari is a perfect example of bringing the beautiful animals of the night to the public without messing with their sleep patterns.This park offers you the option to walk or take a shuttle to see the exhibits. We walked first as the line for the shuttle was so long (it didn't really get any shorter) but you really have to do both. You wont see all the animals on display if you only do one.The dim lighting and forbidden flash photography add a level to the animal's comfort that you don't see too much.I also recommend coming over from the zoo and eating at the multiple cuisine venue at the entrance of the night safari. The prices are reasonable and if you head over before the zoo closes and the safari opens it's much less crowded.
"Wonderful experience at Night Safari, where animals r kept in Open and proper lightning is provided so that v can view them.All animals r very close to road and kept in Open without cage and u view them by a 40 minutes Tram ride makes u view all of them. There is a show also where some animals r shown and it's a good watch. overall recommended to go to Night safari,water is available inside and few eating options too.Souvenir shop is little costly however available inside."
My daughter (25yr old) and I were recommended this night tour and WOW we just loved it. Such a unique experience with fast moving queues and well organised and laid out park. It's a bit of a journey to get there. We went by taxi and it was hard to find one to take us out there. It's a 20 min journey and cost $25 one way. Much better than standing in the heat waiting for a bus. There's multiple food outlets there.My daughter even wanted to go back. It's well worth doing.
"I was cautious about this trip, but I was proved wrong. Very well done, with great trainride, and then fab walks along animal paths. Could have spent much more time thereShop was the usual highly commercial stuff aimed at kids- could do better"
"Cold night Safari (27C). Highlights included: Indian Wolf, Pink Flamingos, Red Foxes, Clouded Leopard, White Lion, the Tram ride and the large fold out map.The adults were impressed by the size the Male Elephant, the Tigers, and the Lions."
"My boyfriend & I came to Singapore for a quick vacation & one of the things I was excited to do was to visit the Night Safari as I had never been to one before. After reading other reviews, I had decided to book the Night Safari Adventure Tour as it was a smaller tour that allowed for a more personal experience & a chance to feed elephants - something neither I or my boyfriend had done before! On our way to the safari, we learned the hard way that Singapore traffic can be truly horrendous & ended up showing up almost an hour late for the tour. However, our tour guide, Lana, was fantastic & rearranged the tour for us so that we would see the show, Creatures of the Night, at a later viewing, while still being apart of our original tour for the rest of the time. She did a fantastic job telling us about all the exhibits & animals & answered all & any questions my boyfriend & I had. Feeding the elephants was also a terrific experience & one I will never forget. I recommend everyone to check out the park & if possible, highly recommend the smaller tour. Thank you again to Lana for making sure we had such a great time!"
"We had heard great things and it didn't disappoint, particularly when a staff member (Sarah) helped with understanding and navigating the trails and giving us insights into the animals. Great viewing of a variety of active animals. We were in Singapore for a week and this was the highlight."
You'll wait a while in the queue - but the end result is well worth it! The Night Safari is just exactly that - a chance for you to be driven around (or walk - but the wee electric train is really super) and see the animals in their natural nighttime environment. It has been very cleverly designed/put together and it complemented our day trip to the zoo no end. Definitely worth paying the extra for and an experience not to forget!
"We arrived at 9:30pm and it was perfect. No queues at all and fairly quiet, the trams were half full.The tram ride was brilliant, it took its time and we got to see all the animals up close. We then opted for the walking trails which were brilliant.The rainforest lumina was a lot of fun. We were the last group to go in (around 11pm) and the whole place was to ourselves. Definitely recommend.All staff were friendly and helpful with very good English."
"We decided to visit the night safari on our first night in Singapore. Our son (4yrs) loves animals so we thought this would be a great family experience. We didnt buy tickets in advance which was a mistake, if you do go buy the tickets online, you will save yourself so much time and avoid the chaos.Our son was excited all the way through the queue until he saw that the tram goes in the dark and he has a complete panic attack, refusing to sit on the tram. The park staff took us off and told us they would put us on the next one once my son had calmed down. But he still wouldn't. But one on the park employees - Damion was amazing, we are so grateful for how he helped us to try and calm down our son, and how he and all the other lovely employees really wanted our family to enjoy this experience.They arranged for our family to have a private buggy, so our son wasn't overwhelmed by all the people on the tram and got to see all the animals he loves and we got to have a really cool experience! Especially seeing the elephants. They even arranged front row seats at the show, but our son was too tired by this point to cope sitting through a show.We have so much gratitude for Damion, Femi, and the other staff who went above and beyond normal customer service. Their care and patients created a beautiful family experience for us that we will always remember. To put it in the word of my 4yr old, that was so awesome...let's go again."
Worth it for the price paid.The light show is great and it clearly show that they put in a lot of effort into this.We had a fun time there.
"My wife and I went tonight, I was on crutches and as soon as I got there they offered me free use of a wheelchair, then looked after my wife and I all night to make sure we had a great time, it was a great night would recommend it to everyone, the food and drinks was very reasonable. Thank you"
"Get in early (at opening time) to enjoy it. The first thing we did was get into the queue for the tram ride. It was near dusk so not quite dark when we went in, but the queue was 20-30 minutes and fully dark when the tram started.We saw almost every animal that the tram passed (elephants, lions, tigers, etc). After the tram, we started with the trails. Walking around the zoo at night was a novel experience. I'd say that there was a 50% chance of seeing most things the train takes you past (some animals were still hiding, while others were very visible).We took our time wondering around, and even stopped to listen to a talk being given at the wallaby's.If your going to the Creatures of the Night show, make sure to sit in the middle section. We ended up at the right hand side and some of the animals were out of sight for us.We didn't bother with the illumination walk..."
"This is a nice Adventure, more tailored for children an families. I had the chance to a white lion, owls, snakes, and other creatures of the night in their environment. You actually can be close to many of them. I got great fluorescent T shirts in their boutique. The food was great also."
After getting a recommendation from my parents to do the night safari I looked online and saw that there was a semi private experience where you get a guided tour of the night safari. Wasn't cheap but 100% do it. We were lucky and only shared the experience with another couple. We were treated like VIP and didn't have to wait at all anywhere. A special buggy takes you everywhere the 'train' takes you however at a much slower pace and you can stop right in front of the lions etc for photos. In fact I actually felt guilty for people not doing the experience as multiple trains went past and we were parked right in front of the action. The guide was fantastic. Very passionate about his job and the animals at the park. The absolute highlight was feeding the elephants at the end. Something I'll never forget and I felt way more comfortable doing this than any animal tourist experience I've seen in other countries which I've avoided out of concern for the animals. Would recommend!
"The Night Safari consisted of a series of carriages being pulled through the zoo.A lot of animals are nocturnal, so there was great activity as they came out to feedWorth a visit for you and your family"
"What is so unique to us about this night safari is that after the tram, which we did 2 times, you can walk to your favorite places and see the animals you want again, and there are hidden gems along the way, like the tiny mouse deer.... our favorites"
"The Night Safari only opens at 7:15pm. But plan to get there early to catch the Thumbuakar Fire show at 6:45pm. As soon as the safari opens, proceed to your right and catch the first show of Creatures of the Night at 7:15pm. Both shows are very entertaining!After the show, do not join the crowds to catch the trams to take the 30 minute ride around the park. Tram 1 ( English tour) has a very very long queue so don't waste your time. Instead do the 3 walking trails first. Yes it can be very dark and scary but there are park personnel at some places to help you. You will get adrenaline rushes from time to time. For me, it was when I realised the spotted hyena was too close for comfort. But there were nice surprises like I saw a little bat sucking on banana juice strategically placed along a path on the fishing cat trail. Unfortunately it's very shy and will fly off when more people come.I caught tram no. 1 at 8:45pm. By then, there was no longer a queue. The tram ride showed many animals you cannot see on the walking trails. Sometimes the animals like the tapir, some deer were less than a meter away from the tram that night.A very enjoyable 3 hour visit!"
It was one of best experience..!! Walk through the night safari you must do.. Food at ulu was delicious.
"Visiting a zoo in Night time , it was a great experience. Animals are not caged and they roam free. Your tour is guided, with all the info about the animals. Really worth a trip."
"you need around 4-5 hours to visit this place and enjoy it. The best time is evening and night. you can take a round in Toy Train there , then walk to some walking trails . have a feel of forest and animals. Keep in mind you should not create any noise to enjoy it fullest. many types of animals and birds are there."
"The night safari at the zoo was unlike any experience I've had with animals. We had the opportunity to see leopards, tigers, and hippos being feed! We even got to interact with fruit bats and porcupines. The zoo is a little far from downtown, but highly worth the experience!"
"First of all I need you guys to know that this safari is an experience of a life time coz I have never seen a night zoo safari with animals from all around the world. The tour is well guided and is in english, people are requested to stay away from clicking fotos as it scares the animals. Animals are a few meters away so you get a close look of the them n it takes a total of 45mins for the entire tour. At the end you must take some goodies for children coz they have some good merchandise by disney."
"The Night Safari is Absolutely Amazing and it's absolute worth going there. Of course, a beautiful place Singapore, you also get to know a wide variety of culture, trends and how people actually live there. Also the zoo is really huge and has many different kinds of shows happening and they are good too. You'll surely have fun and it's worth a go."
"I'm usually not someone who enjoys zoo but this experience was truly unique. The animal's aren't caged so you get to see them in their natural habitat. In addition, the night safari includes various fun facts about the animals and once you're done there are plenty of shows and attractions to do in the zoo. We spent a good 6 hours there. My advice, book for an earlier time slot (like 7:15pm) so that you can fully enjoy all that the zoo has to offer."
"This was a good experience - extremely long wait in the queue. However totally worth it. We took the tram ride, one can do on foot as well. I loved the way they explained about each animal and its habitat"
"Didn't have high expectations for this having heard from others that it is not great. However, we really enjoyed it. It does take a bit of getting used to looking for animals in the dark, but we did see more than we expected.Made our own way by taxi to the zoo and did not book the tram options at all - went round as much as possible on foot to start with, bypassing the tram queue, and then took the tram last (to see the bigger animals) when there was no queue at all!Stayed to watch the final Creatures of the Night show, which was fun.Maybe it was better for us because we were not time limited by a hotel transfer - and this may have helped us to avoid any queues.All in all we were there around 3 hours."
Night safari lets you experience the zoo in a whole new different perspective.We came straight from the airport and reached the Night safari by 9pm. We didn't know we can still enjoy the layover flight to Dubai and see so much interesting things at the night safari.
Had a great time....since we went on weekend it was too crowded. Other than that had a best experience of forest in night...if u have do visit..
"Great trip. Especially the tigers/lions near the end.Recommend walking around the part of the zoo first (to the left) then drive the train, otherwise you could be queuing a lot and have a lot of noise as I saw that the trains later on in the evening were empty.Cost us $55 dollars back to the centre in a taxi for 8 of us and took about 20 minutes. Got there by public transport for the same cost and it took ages. Not sure how much it would be for 4 but there is a shuttle that picks up from hotels and is definately cheaper and than public transport and probably much simpler."
"I went with my wife, son and his son(5 years old) to the Singapore Night Safari recently - 14th August - and it was a great experience. We enjoyed it tremendously because:1. It was very well organized. The crowd control feels exactly like Disney World in Florida. So don't worry about the large crowds that go there!2. The program consists of two parts (1) a 30+/- minutes tram ride wherein one can see certain animals such as elephants; tigers; african lions; etc and then (2) your choice of walks: either a long, medium or short walks. During these walks one can see other animals not seen during the tram ride; OR, one can also re-visit the animals already seen.3. Both parts of the program kept our young grand kid's attention and motivated him to WALK in the Singaporean heat! The adults were also captivated by the experience.4. TIP the program usually starts at 7.15 when it is most crowded. If one arrives after 8pm it is less crowded. However, crowd control is very well organized.A great experience! Not to be missed!"
Un modo muy diferente de ver los animales en su habitat. Los shows estuvieron muy buenos. Solo recomendarÃ­a un poco mÃ¡s de luz en algunos lugares pues en general es muy exitante pasar por los senderos en la oscuridad.A very different way of seeing animals in their habitat. The shows were very good. I would only recommend a little more light in some places because in general it is very exciting to go through the trails in the dark.
"Last time I don't think there was a time slot allocation but the new system was really good to prevent over-crowding! But was disappointed when I couldn't find the Suspension Bridge. Really wanted to show my birthday girl that. Also, really, prepare to bring your guts out when you drop by!I got scared by a Tapir that was camping in the dark near the tram route, our tram went over maybe a tree branch? and I thot there was an animal in the bushes and I freaked out. An unidentified animal ran across the walking trail and lastly I got hissed at by a fruit bat/flying fox when I wanted to take a pic. (And I'm 32 : ( what fun huh?!) My birthday girl had lots of fun especially her interaction with the keeper at the Wallaby exhibit.She learnt new stuff that day too!I really love how the Night Safari has evolved over the years, you should go visit if you haven't been!"
"This is a great zoo, seen at night. You can take a guided tour on a tram around the park, but be prepared to wait for upwards of an hour. A good idea would be to go for a walk first, when everyone else heads straight for the tram queue. Then after you have had a look around, take the tram. We found out the hard way, doing the tram first. When we finished the ride there was nobody waiting anymore!"
"We had loads of fun. This place is full of fun activities for family especially young kids.Unlike many other zoo's around the world, this place actually takes extreme good care of the animals.Do not miss this attraction! This is a must do as you will never see it elsewhere."
It is really amazing how they managed to display all the animals in the night. It was totally Ann amazing sight to see all the animal behavior at night. Interestingly they seemed more active and natural at night.
"We are regular visitors to the Singapore zoo - and we have in tow a 2.5 years old. We recently braved a visit to the Night Safari the first time (our last time there were when we were both kids - and we have not returned earlier as it is famous for its crowd). All three of us had a great time.I was surprised myself.1) *Find a way to get in the priority queue.* WRS members get priority. Elderly and folks with disabilities are also given priority. If you booked certain tours you are also given priority.2) *Do NOT take the tram. Do the trails first.* You would have waited in LONG lines 2x (ticketing counter, the queue to enter the park even though there is a timing allocated) after you manage to clear the ticket gate. You will see another long line ahead (where 95% of people head to) for the tram. NO do not join that line. Look at your map - walk to the left and right and start the trails.3) *Nocturnal animals are mostly SMALL animals.* The majority of the interesting exhibits are along the trails. You will never be able to see an owl or a porcupine on a moving tram 50m away from the little guy in a rainforest at night.4) *Finding the animals is part of the fun.* This is a zoo, not a circus. Don't expect to easily spot all the animals listed on the map. The flying squirrels live on trees in tropical rainforests - finding something on a rainforest tree at night is definitely not easy. The hyena may decide to hide when you are there. Go with the right expectation and mindset - the keepers are around and they helped us find some animals.5) *There are many interesting animals that are (as far as I can remember) not in the day zoo.* Things like the babirusa, bongo, hyena, tarsier, porcupine, civets, various cats, flying squirrels, cloud leopard - just to name a few.6) *Do not leave when everyone is leaving.* We did not watch the show at the end of our visit - because we do not want to leave with the show crowd. There are plenty of cabs around and we managed to get one within 10min in line.We didn't take the tram, we didn't watch the show - but we didn't feel like we missed anything and we loved it."
"Buying tickets in advance for Singapore night safari is to be strongly recommended if the enormous queues on our arrival - at 8:15pm - and departure - at 9:45pm - is anything to go by. Luckily we had done just that. We had got a taxi to the zoo, a fair way out of central Singapore - not bad value at 25 dollars, although cheaper shuttle bus and other travel options are available.Having seen the huge queues for the teams which drive people around the zoo, we opted to tackle the visit on foot. I think this was worthwhile, as it seemed to get us much closer to a number of enclosures. There were a few ups and downs but it was not a long walk.There were a few Jurassic Park moments during our walk, arriving at enclosures and not being able to see any sign of the animal it was supposed to house, but not too many and the big animals - lions, tiger and crocodiles were all out and about when we arrived - we were also lucky enough to witness the feeding of the lion (9pm) and tiger (9:30pm). Other animals included wallabies, deer, flying foxes (open enclosure), warthogs, various exotic cats and porcupine.As far as zoos go, they appeared to offer relatively generously sized enclosures, although they could always be bigger. The animals we saw all looked very healthy and well cared for.Overall, a unique and interesting experience in Singapore."
"It was a amazing experience. without walking on a Tram ride you get to see the animals. The services provided by them is great. I have my disabled dad with us, they took good care of him, one person was with full time and assisted us with the wheelchair and we were given first chance. ."
"Very long day and night at the zoo so many things to do and so many things to see, but the night safari was expensive but nice to see the food and the workers were very helpful as it is a very large zoo"
"We opted to do the night safari tour with dinner. We booked through a Tour service and if you don't want to be stuck for hours waiting in line to board one of the trains at the zoo, you need to do this as tour participants get priority. The views of the animals on the safari was up close and amazing. After wards you can also walk around to view more animals or see one of the shows. Dress lightly as it is even more humid at the zoo than other areas of Singapore. A terrific experience."
We were amazed by the experience we got through the visit. The walkabout really brings us close to the animals followed by the tram ride and the animal show was amazing. We had fun and my little ones keeps talking about their experience at the safari until today! We will surely come again in future!
We took advice and booked a tour with the priority tram ticket and pickup from our hotel. It was great to not to have to wait. The queues were long! We enjoyed the commentary and the ease of getting there and back. Our guide was fun. Would recommend paying extra if you can.
"After hearing so much about the night safari in Singapore, I finally have the chance to visit (with friends), and will definitely come back and visit again with my (teens) children.A night experience that indeed show you a lot about the wildlife, and what they do at night. Taking the tour bus (included) was great seeing all the (nocturnal) animals. We also walked all the trails and got closer look at the animals.Remember to get there early, as the queues are always long. Do online booking if possible & you can go straight to the gate.Highly recommended to families."
Feels like a real safari! No visible fences makes it feel like you are really in the animals homes however all still very safe. Bit of a wait for the cars but worth it!
"Great place to visit. Recommend the Night-SafariGet to see many animals with limited light. It's another when you see I'm film or television, you will perk up, and say I have been there"
"My family loves zoos. We have been to zoos all over the world, and this experience was unique. We have been living in Singapore, so asked around for tips before going. We opted for the 8:15 tickets, which meant we were not in the first wave crowd. It made for a late night, but we went on a weekend evening so no one was sleepwalking through the next day. If you are on vacation, then I think the 8:15 is the best slot. We also did not do the tram first, but instead walked around the entire park first. We took water bottles, and the park has chilled water dispensers for free refills. The whole walk is about 2.5 km, with some up and down hills, but we took about 2 hours to do it. It is crowded at first, but the further you walk from the entrance the more sparse the crowds. We took time at each exhibit, and found the animals in most. It is important to realize that a lot of the animals can only be seen on foot, and there are others, like the elephants, that can only be seen from the tram. A docent, Ziyi, started talking to us at the owl exhibit and really engaged our girls in discussions about the animals. He ended up walking (leading) with us the rest of the zoo, and this really enriched our experience! He was knowledgeable about the animals, and also expert at finding them, and explaining what they were doing.After the walking tour, we went to the tram, which had no line and was not crowded at all. This allowed us to take pictures in all directions, and really enjoy the tour. I would definitely recommend walking first (even if only part of the whole trail) to avoid the lines - it makes the Tram experience so much easier and better."
"My traveling companion in Southeast Asia was a zoologist, so we went to just about every zoo in the region. I definitely recommend this one. The focus on nocturnal animals is unique and interesting. You can take the walking trails, which are heavily landscaped and feel like walking through an actual jungle, and/or ride the tram, which gets you closer to some of the habitats. A great experience -- highly recommended."
"There were Long queues to entry but well controlled and efficient. Staff were alert and professional . The queue moved fast, so no worries. Just be a little patient. Recommended to walk the trails before taking tram to see the rest of the safari. Last tram ride at 1120pm. Do wear comfortable shoes. Recommended for adults, dating couples, teenagers. Not suitable for young kids, as place is quite dark and late, so they will be tired, craggy, which might spoil the experience. Overall, it's a relaxing romantic experience."
We arrived late due to mother and children in tow and Rachel at the entrance gates made the whole experience a dream come true! She went over and above.We were shown straight to the tram and then off the tram to the animal show! This woman is seriously sorted.
"With a bit of research and planning, a visit to Singapore's Zoo Night Safari is worth it for a close up encounter to many animals you will likely never see in the wild.We arrived at the zoo after a long MRT ride during rush hour to the Ang Mo Kio stop, transferring to bus # 138 opposite the MRT station in the AMK (Ang Mo Kio) Hub. This process took about an hour and 1/2. Once we arrived at the zoo we followed the signs for ticketing since I had ordered and paid for the tickets on-line. The zoo was complete chaos. So many people!!! Once we were in the tram line for an 815 pm departure, an employee instructed the crowd to skip the tram line and do the walking trails. He stated that the tram ride was available until 11pm and the crowds would be lighter the later we went. We REALLY should have listened to this advice. The queue for the tram took us 45 minutes to go through in the sticky heat and humidity, surrounded by chattering crowds. Once we got on the tram, the chattering didn't stop until I started saying ""shhhh"" and others caught on. However, we were unfortunate to have one young woman sitting behind us who just couldn't seem to stay silent during the tram ride :-(. BUT, overall the tram ride was amazing, and we saw some exceptional animals, full of activity. After the tram ride, we walked back through the zoo on the trails and this was very special. I do wish that the zoo would do the following:1) Have written instructions on how to get the most out of the experience, instead of just having an employee shouting instructions into a microphone;2) Encourage patrons to be more respectful by limiting loud voices and conversations. The animals don't like it and many of us human beings do not care for it either.3) Increase the message of conservation. The time for casual conversation is over. Our planet is in a climate crisis and human beings are the largest contributing factor.On a side note, I really appreciated the many water filling stations available by the restrooms. Bring your refillable water bottles to stay hydrated in the sticky heat and try and do your part to not contribute to increase plastic consumption."
Worth a visit after the day at the Zoo.Nice Ambience.Nice ride and cool performance and music.I would like to go again.
"We went to the Night safari on a Wednesday night. We were there early after visiting the river safari, so were at the front of the line when the gates opened. Miss 8 was unwell and didn't want to go on the tram, so we went straight to see the creatures of the night show. It was very entertaining. We then walked the trails. It was fantastic. There were not many animals that we couldn't see. We hadn't originally planned on going but I'm so glad we did. It was worth it."
"The night we went was raining...Was deciding if we were to cancel the trip n head home but found a lot of people still heading in so off we went... Upon arrival, we went on the tram... The queue was fast n organised... There was always trams arriving after the previous has left... Staffs tries their best to clean the wet chairs for us to sit and getting us on the tram swiftly so that the next group can go... Saw some animals in the rain... Was not able to see the show when the rain stopped as the show time at 830 is full and we didn't want to wait till 930... Will be back again when it's not raining..."
We enjoyed it with young kids.Need to book the events in advance.A bit of a pain to get to and from if no car but a good experience.
"When I went there, I rode a shuffle car to see around the safari. There are many animals and it's interesting to see them in night. To see that, I bought a ticket from online and need to wait for a long time. Please make sure to check weather whether it will rain or not. You should also eat something before your turn."
"We came here at the start of the craziness of COVID 19 so it was unusually quiet in Singapore when we visited. Therefore we didn't have to wait in many queues, the only wait was for the shuttle, but the line moved quickly. The shows were entertaining as well as full of interesting facts. It really is quite a strange experience wandering around a zoo at night. A memorable experience. We spent the afternoon at the River Safari and then headed to the Night Safari. Getting there is super easy, head to Khatib MRT and take the Mandai Zoo shuttle straight to the zoo."
"1. We choose the first train tour, which startet a bit before darkness. Tour was good, a lot of animals. Not enough light to take photos, but to much to feel at this is ""the night safari"". Maybe next train tour is better.2. After train tour we took walking tours - it was much better! So dark at we hardly saw each other, animals in minimum light, great experience!"
Night safari as an amazing experience. Try to arrive early so you can see as much as possible.Make sure you walk around the trails for better viewing of more animals and not just sit on the tram. Tram riding is not interacting.
Overall good experience from the park.Things for improvement- Animal show can be better- Tram ride not so interactive
"The Singapore zoo night safari was lots of fun and gives you a great insight on how they conserve and look after the animals. The creatures of the night show beforehand was fun as well, and shows the animals with their trainers. All round good night, looking forward to exploring more of the zoo!"
Night safari as an amazing experience. Make sure you walk around the trails for better viewing of more animals and not just sit on the tram. Anyway I think it's little over priced!
A bit eerie at times. The tram was OK but a bit rushed and difficult to see the animals on the left hand side (more on the right hand side). Better to do the walking circuit which takes about 60-90 minutes. We did see a leopard! Photography was difficult with a standard camera. Flash is understandable not allowed.
Was okay not exactly what I expected but was good to go and experience and the show at the end was excellent as well as the fire show. The animals on the tram tour part seemed very staged
This was a visit worth taking. We went there on the very first day of arrival. Managing time to watch all the shows is an issue. Some of the situations with animals seem not natural. The visit of the zoo by tram is very good
This was an amazing feat of organisation. There were many people but the attendants were helpful in how they assisted us to the right location.The Safari show was very entertaining and the host was superb and got the crowd into the experience. The animals were well trained and a lot of fun.The actual Safari demonstrated an amazing layout of a variety of animals. My only disappointment was that we traveled through it a little too quickly. I would have liked it to be a bit slower.I was amazed at how quickly the time went. I also want to encourage Singapore Zoo in its efforts in wildlife education and conservation.
"We were torn whether to visit the Night Safari or Singapore Zoo but chose this as it seemed like a unique experience - and we certainly weren't disappointed.On arrival, most people head straight to the tram so we walked along the paths instead. This place has a very special atmosphere and it was wonderful to see the animals start to quietly emerge as it got darker. After we'd walked everywhere we saw the show (fun but probably aimed more for kids), and then got on the tram for the drive around. Do try to do a bit of walking as well as the tram - we saw some animals one way but not the other and vice versa.I'd highly recommend this place as I've never come across anything quite like it and it's a much more manageable temperature to be walking around than in the day! Takes about 45min-1 hour to get there in a taxi from the centre."
Good to see animals in natural habitat without restraint.Best for kids 5-10Adults also can enjoy.One show was good but it appeared it hurried very quickly may be animals were not in mood .worth to visit
This is one of the most unique experience so basically an animal Safari during those night.We were here during the Christmas time and it was very crowded we waited for couple of hours to reach to the tram but after that it was an out of the world experience.The tram passes through the forest and there is commentary in English an the animals that you pass by.There were a few animals that we saw
Just really hot. The fans and AC were not enough to keep the heat at bay. Long lines for the trolley cart but not too bad. Pretty quick service but the ticket machines were too far away from the main entrance :)
"We had a great time at the night safari during a long Friday evening layover at the airport. We booked 7:15 tickets on online but underestimated the length of the taxi que and busy peak hour traffic from the airport (50min travel) about ($40 Sing Dollars) and got there late. To not spend time waiting in lines we walked around the zoo first, it took 1 1/2 hrs then got on a quarter full tram (no line) for the 40 min ride. Whilst the day zoo is a better experience if you only have time to do one. For repeat visitors, the night zoo was awesome to see animals up and active. Our 10yr and 12yr boys really enjoyed it. We left at 10:20pm. Plenty of taxis waiting at the rank and we're back at the airport 25 mins later. Terrific way to spend the layover."
Book tickets on the website as you get a discount but be careful since you can easily book the wrong ticket. Go for the 7.15pm slot if you can get it as you may have to queue for the tram and if you do the walking trails you may run out of time to see the animals of the night show. The tram is a must since you will miss some of the major animals such as elephant and lion.
Nice experience.. Nice trip with tram but no very amazing the show what they make later.. All the customers have to been once there
Brought some foreign friends to the night safari as they have heard much good reviews about the place. We were kind of turned off my the snaking queues before the place opened. Went in and queued again for the show AND again for the tram but thankfully the staff were friendly and it was quite well managed. Visibility was quite an issue for those who can't see well at night. Much preferred the visit to the singapore zoo.
"The animal wasn't as good, not worth the queue. The tram is ok for people that doesn't want to walk but if can, go for the walking trail, it's pretty good."
The Night Safari is worth doing and you get to see many different animals. You do need to queue up to visit this attraction and then queue again to get onto the tram that takes you around the complex. The audio was informative but at times poor quality. It did stop at times to allow you to take photos but other times if the animals were not at the expected location you missed these. There are many walking tracks that you can take for a better chance to view these animals.
"Good experience to watch nocturnal animals, we don't realize when we visit the zoo most of the tropical animals are nocturnal. Tram ride and night show was good. If tram would stop little more to look both sides, specially for kids."
"Those who prefer to walk, the trail is approximately 2hrs to complete (close up with animal, only if you could spot them in the dark).Tram ride is a must which include narrating of in relation to the enclosure."
"I did it two times. Liked the tram ride. You can relax and watch animals, many of which come quite close to you. Trail walk is a little tedious and animals are hard to see."
We travelled on the complimentary tram ride taking you around the park viewing animals while having information provided. They also have a Fire twirling show at different times. Gates open at 7.45pm - 12am. You can also walk around set out tracks to view the animals if you prefer. Can take pictures however no flash for safety reasons.
"To be honest I'd been here 2yrs ago and it wasn't as good this time it seemed really short compared to 2yrs ago, didn't see that many animals as we went round, whether its because I'd been before that it seemed shorter not sure."
"I really enjoyed doing the night safari because most animals were quite awake, the zoo was too dark thought and they don't allow to take pictures with flash."
We started off with a buffet dinner as part of the group itinerary. The food was surprisingly reasonable as you come with low expectation at a huge dining hall for tourists. Then we hop onto the tram and off we go. You can see that safety was high on the agenda as there are plenty of staff along the track. It was a pity we did not have time to go on the walking trails. An enjoyable experience !
"Saw lot of reviews at this space giving various angles. Took the trip anyway without dinner. It was a priority trip, so could skip lines for the tram ride. Feel that time is a bit short as if one wish to take the walk, then you miss the show."
"What an experience, different to other 'daytime' zoos.We were mesmerised as the Lion seemed to go around his Lionesses and with a nuzzle against their cheek seemed to be kissing them all goodnight before he lay down adjacent to them, keeping them in view of course.The less dangerous species were mostly open range which added to the experience.Well worthwhile and good value for money '¦ we would visit again."
Informative.Well managed.But can be given a miss.On second thoughts i should not have gone.Food and water a bit costly.In name of plastic bottle ban paper bottles have become too costly.
"We did the 8.15 night safari. Never been in a cue quite so long and so many people. It was packed. What I would suggest is book the 8.15 or even later time for the safari, then do the fishing cats and walking tour that can take as long as you like, then when the crowds have died down get on the safari trams. Park doesn't close till midnight so plenty of time. Much better than cueing for an hour plus. The animal enclosures were quite nice, not a huge selection of animals but it was nice. People are very ignorant on the trams using flash photography when not allowed. Not the cheapest but it was pleasant walk around."
"The Night Safari is a ride at night through open enclosures of animals and is a treat to watch. The night viewing experience is very unique. You can ride their cable car or walk on foot. Not recommended for those who have arrived in Singapore the same day as it gets very late here and you would be very tired and sleepy to enjoy it.Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari, and Jurong Bird Park are adjacent to each other and must be done on the same day. I visited Singapore Zoo, River Safari, and Night Safari in one day. These places can be visited on the day you arrive in Singapore but not the departing day as Night Safari gets over quite late in the evening."
"Although you might have tickets with time like 7.15 pm, it is best to enter the place before 7 pm.I entered around 7 pm and had to be in que for 30 minutes.Nevertheless they manage the que very well, so it's always moving.What's good about this night safari is you can observe the wildlife in closed range (without touching ofcourse) and the good natural vibe of night jungle.You can observe and listen to the audio guide for herbivore (deers, rhino, elephants, bears) and carnivore (lions, hyenas). Most animals are asian based (I never we have lions in Asia until now)There is also a group walking along the trails which is really interesting. (additional activity)"
"Saw the night SafariLocation is slightly far off and one needs to leave a little early.Night Safari is again initiated by a queue, as usual for any activity in Singapore.People are taken in open trams through out the area. One also has the option to alight in between and wait for the next trams which follow up regularly.Lovely animals in dim lighting are visible at close quarters.Animals like tigers, lion, hippo, hyena, deers, elephants, bear, cheetah, buffaloes, etc are visible clearly.Photography without flash is allowed.Tram ride with commentary is about 25 odd minutes.This is followed by a show of animals from close quarters of python, owls, racoon etc with viewer involvement in the proceedings.Also a 5 minutes fire dance is out on to reduce the boredom in queue waiting."
"Family as in mother daughter not teen- option wasn't there to tick.It's not as expected, a bit exaggerated but train trip is good, walking is too late to trail for ladies"
"There are so many activities to do with kids in Singapore, but it's often too hot to really enjoy them. My kids (11 and 8) really enjoyed the night safari, they were very excited to see lions, rhinos, and bears. Everyone sits in a tram that drives relatively slowly around the park, with a recording that informs you of what animals are on which side of the tram (there are animals on both sides, though probably the person sitting on the right hand side (when you are seated facing forward) has a better view. You can see the animals, though the lighting is fairly low so it's not great visibility. The tram stops fairly briefly for people to see, then it moves on. Getting good photos is difficult. The whole thing was over fairly quickly, however the kids were so excited and enjoyed it so much I feel it was worth it and a great experience"
"The Night Safari in itself was so, so, so awesome. I could've spent ages wondering around there in the darkness. We didn't know, so we waited for 30-40 minutes for the tram ride: it was nice but the wait took away almost all the time we had for wandering around before heading back to the bus. If we would've known how awesome the place otherwise is, we probably would've spent the waiting and tram time walking around and, if time willing, go on the tram ride and not the other way around."
"Its pretty dark at night, sometimes you are unable to see the animals, the trekking paths are quite easy to trek, just beware of the night tram that crosses. The paths are not very well lit as its a sanctuary for the wildlife. Do wear proper shoes! :)"
For a family with young children book your tickets early in advance but also an early timeslot that will be dark as well to try and alleviate the tiredness setting in too early. It was a really interesting experience going it at night time. When watching shows I recommend sitting at the back but also at the aisle to make a quick exit for the tram. It was crowded when we went and some tourists can be quite pushy. Overall good experience. Also have dinner before you go in and have it not at the zoo or just be prepared for those tourist prices.
Quite an enjoyable evening. Was quite busy but did not take long to oin a tram for the ride. Recommended.
"We went with four other friends and had a buffet dinner before the tram trip around the zoo at night. They arranged to pick us up at our hotel and bused us there. Our guide was called Bas(although his name was much longer). He gave us a very entertaining commentary on the bus trip to the zoo. He told us lots of facts about the zoo and about Singapore. Our group of 6 thoroughly enjoyed his banter and jokes. The buffet dinner we were served was surprisingly good. A wide choice of very tasty food. The service in the dining area for drinks etc was faultless. Then Bas led us to our tram, to travel around the zoo. The trip around the zoo took about 45 minutes. The running commentary on the tram was informative and interesting. Obviously the trip was during the night, so some of the animals were a bit hard to see, but i think we saw most of them pretty well. We then had the opportunity to walk some of the trails through the zoo. We did a couple of them, but it was pretty hot and humid, so we made our was back to the exit with about 15 minutes to spare before our due pick up time. Bas then told us which bus to get on for the trip back to our hotel. He again, was very informative on the way back. We then were transferred to a smaller bus to get us back to our hotel. Overall, this was a well organised and enjoyable experience. The only thing I would comment on, is maybe improving the signage on the walking trails. But this is a very minor point. I would recommend this tour highly."
"This was I think our best experience in Singapore.We went in at 19:30 and there werenÂ´t so many people. The train ride was nice and you can actualy see a lot of animals. Big advantage against regular zoo is that at night they are usually way more active.We also went for Creatures of the night show and unless you are bringing children you can skip it I think. It is cute and all, but not really that interesting for an adult.After that you can spend approximately 1,5 hour walking through the safari. Some of exhibits are very nice (giant bats, otters, mouse deer), other made me a little sad (jaguar) But overally it was nice experience.Still recommend to do to Malaysia and spend night in actual jungle though :-)"
"It is rather astonishing how much people think in a place like this that the animals should be arranged purely and entirely for their own entertainment. If visiting here, one has to accept that you'll get to see some of the animals but not others. There's an element of chance, and that's OK.The reality is the views you do get are sensational and magical. The reality is that to see these animals in natural environments in the hours of dark is wonderful.If there was a disappointment it was that we'd bought a package that included a dinner. The Indian food was OK, but not stunning. It also felt very odd to sit and eat in a large space where there were no other people. 'Drinks' basically consisted of water only."
"The night safari was good experience. The staff were friendly. It was definitely a different experience compare to a day zoo. Maybe we could have gone there a bit earlier to see the animals at the zoo too though. But because it was late and dark, could barely see the animals in the safari but the feeling of riding in the dark was great."
"This was a fun experience! We were told by a friend to get the 7:15 entrance but that sold out several days in advance (so book early)! We ended up with the 8:15 slot and many of the animals were hiding / sleeping (which was a little disappointing). We also walked the whole thing (about 3 miles) because the line was long for the tram ride. If you're going to walk, wear comfortable shoes and bring water (they allowed me to bring my own water bottle). Also, it was very hot, even at night - so be prepare to sweat.All in all though, it was a great experience!"
"I had a very limited time schedule in singapore and after reading reviews here I almost didn't do this because there were so many negatives. However friends who live in singapore told us it was a must see and gave us tips on missing the crowds. It was really worth doing but I think it is worth reading the following tips:Tips:1. It takes a long time to get here on public transport (this Is surprisingly information that isn't emphasised anywhere I found). If you are planning to do the MRT to ang mo kio and then the bus there, it does go straight to the doors but the bus ride is quite long (and it's a public bus so it stops multiple times on the way). It takes around 35-40 minutes on the bus (in light traffic) so be aware of this and factor an hour total travel time if doing the above. I personally would just take a taxi if I went next time (a 'grab' taxi from the city will cost around 18-20 dollars). We took a standard taxi home (to novena area) and it cost around 35 bucks, grab is much cheaper (Uber equivalent in singapore which is pretty good).2. GO LATER (perhaps aim to arrive between 2000-2100, go watch sunset first somewhere else) and aim to do the tram ride later when most people have gone. We had this advice from friends and basically we took the last tram ride (2215) and the queue was minimal (maybe 10 minutes). Friends have said definitely don't queue up for the tram rides before 2100 as it is packed (note queuing is the cause of most of the negative reviews).3. If you decide to go a bit earlier than 2100 then do all the walking trails FIRST and then the tram ride later. There are a lot of great animals you won't see on the tram at all, and you will see much closer up and have time to appreciate including tigers and leopards. Also on the tram there are animals that you don't see but then I ended up seeing on the walking tracks (eg. I saw the lions and the leopard which I missed on the tram). Factor around an hour at least to do the walking tracks at pace, more if you want to dawdle and read all the info etc. I think it's actually more enjoyable than the tram....4. The tram ride is not that enjoyable, as it is ruined by Chinese tourists talking loudly and incessantly so you can barely hear the commentary. Also the commentary is a real Disney style pre-recorded blurb, it's sad they don't choose to have the driver do a live commentary. There are a few (not that many) areas that you won't get to see on walking tracks though, so it is still worth doing.So in conclusion it's a really good experience and you see some great animals - just take my advice and- arrive later- do walking tracks first and tram after to avoid huge queues for tram- factor at least 2 hours for the whole visit- factor in an hour to get there if using public transport (I would take a grab taxi!)"
"This was an interesting trip as you get a trip around the zoo especially designed to see nocturnal animals and some others who feed at night. I.E. Elephants, Rhino and the amazing Malaysian Tiger. Plus lots more including the rare pangolin.Pre book with a tour company to avoid the queues"
"A Night Safaris at its best, we were truly amazed at the variety of animals in what appeared to be naturalistic surroundings. No difficulty at seeing the animals in the darkened surroundings. The only downside is the long wait to board the vehicles taking us around the zoo."
"Very nice experience. However, some animals cannot be seen during the tour. It was during peak times, so expect at least 45 minutes waiting time."
If you are going and do not like lining up....book a tour with a tour guide...pay for priority boarding on the tram...and even with that we still had long waits...we took the dinner option...even though the food was OK...would have rather spend the time in the Night Safari...ran out of time before our bus returned to hotel....The animals were great....just needed more time!
"It was one of the best attractions during Singapoure visit - animals walking on its own in gungles, screaming roaring, nearby the tram. The only problem - long queue and waiting around 1 hour to sit in the tram, even we got e-tickets."
We enjoyed our evening at the night safari. The show with the nocturnal animals was really great. The tram ride was ok too. The waiting time for the tram was a bit too long. It takes away too much time.
"It was good decision for us to arrive at Night Safari before 06:00PM. It was the result that we could see many animals including lion,hippo, elephant before it was getting dark. Actually it was Evening Safari.We strongly recommend to take 07:15PM entry."
The Safari ride was great and intuitive... There was a digital presentation and the characters came to life...
As always nature at its very best and never ceases to amaze and inform me.63 years old and still learning!
"We had a great time exploring but the wait for the tram took away some of the experience and to be honest, we saw more animals during the day visit."
"I visit the Night Safari at least 2-3 times annually. We love the facility and the drama of the night zoo. It's evolved so much over the years and it's the only attraction I proudly bring my overseas guest to (even those who have gone to S.Africa to see the big 5).On my last visit in July (8:15pm slot) we were still excited to go however, upon being told to move forward to the 8:15pm (by someone who already validated my ticket) I was shouted at by on of the Q - minders whom I flashed my ticket too. He shouted ""Hello?! What's that?!. I was puzzled and told him this is the e-ticket on my mobile phone. He then said, that's not the ticket. I was puzzled and then realized that while I was walking forward, the tickets had scrolled to the Rain forest Lumnia (It was a package - so the RFL ticket was before the NS ticket and we has 6 tickets in total). I told him, oh of course its the correct ticket, it was checked already and it must have moved.... He then replied curtly, I cannot touch your phone. So I showed it to him again. All this despite being checked to enter the 815pm Q earlier. I know he was making sure but, he could have asked nicely or been trained to identify how a packaged e-ticked was displayed.The other disappointment aspect was all the staff on ground. At least 80% looked and sounded like they did not want to be there.... This was not the attraction I was used to visiting. Smiling and welcoming on ground staff.. waving at the trams as they pass by, all I saw and heard were glum faces, and shouts at everyone (yes it was very crowded) but, shouting at guest to hurry up and move and fill up the tram seats was uncalled for.... it was noisy and unprofessional. They were obviously untrained and stressed. 80% of them would not be fit to work at a Disney resort! We made our way to the East Lodge only to find vending machines... of poor quality... melted and refroze ice cream filled with ice crystals... no water only soft drinks... Then we walked to see the giraffes near the reservoir just by memory of their location as we missed them during our previous visits and saw everything been boarded up. I asked the staff near the tram stop where were they moved to and to my horror and amusement his response was a simple ""Dead. Dead already"". All in all the animals saved the day of the visit. The fire dancers was entertaining as always and so was the Creatures of the night staff. Please up skill some of your ground staff. They are a part of the overall experience"
It was really good. Only downside was most animals were in their caves therefore they could not be seen that clearly.
"We have been to the night safari a couple of time, this time we went for my youngest son to see it. It is really an interesting attraction, and we usually enjoy it a lot. However this time is was excessively overcrowded due to it being a public holiday. The crowds made it impossible to make it to the show. This being a somewhat pricy adventure, the value for money on this particular visit was not good either."
Night Safari was great! Lots of stuff to see... only time was too tight as we arrived at 815pm.Lumina was kinda of a waste of time.
Was very cool to see all the nocturnal animals at night. Our kids loved it. We chose to walk around so we could see everything in our own time and up close.
"It was a family outing with 2 overseas relative, they were impressed and had fun. It was abit tiring for my baby cousin tho as the trail was abit long"
"Singapore night safari is one attraction, which is not to be missed. The night safari ticket and the entrance is different from the zoo. Photos are challenging, but you will enjoy watching animals in night mode."
"We arrived at 815 and were shuffled straight into the tram queue where we dutifully queued for an hour with 4 kids. The tram ride was ok but the walking trails were really lovely - saw leopard close up, wallabies, leopard cat flying foxes. Food tasty."
"Fun for allA upclose encounter with animals , and seeing them at night is a new experience.Animals are kept well, in their natural habitat.A must go .."
"We arrived in good time for our 9.15pm slot, but were dismayed to join a lengthy queue already snaking well out of the entry area. It took a good 30 minutes before we gained entrance to the park, and then were confronted by an equally lengthy queue for the train which takes visitors round the park. Quickly decided to ignore that route and take the path, which meant we missed out on the elephants, hippoes and a few other animals, but got close up to the leopards, cloud leopards, hyenas, bats, owls and myriad other nocturnal animals. We were with 3 boys who all loved the experience, not least because we stayed until the park closed at midnight!"
"We had 8.15pm entry tickets so arrived early to enjoy the African drumming and fire show. The queue for the tram was long so we walked around the zoo first.. really enjoyed this, even though it was still very hot. We saw about 80-90% of the animals, which is pretty high for a zoo.Joined the tram queue at 9.45pm and didn't get on it till 11pm. The queue was very hot, made easier by an enterprising employee selling cold drinks halfway round. I enjoyed the tram ride but if I'd known the queue would take that long I'd have skipped it. They also really need to oil the connections between tram carriages.. lots of squeaking!"
It was a great tram ride was able to see animals that are normally sleeping during the day did move quickly so hard to get pictures. Line for the tram was long but moved quickly. Come earlier if you want to do the walking trials to see the different animal exhibits and some that you can't see from the tram. Also both shows were cute and entertaining would recommend.
I told myself that I should not expect a real wildlife in this small island. But the night safari made me impressed. Very nice place for educating children.
"We visited the night safari as a group of 9. We got tickets on line through a 3rd party which worked as quite a bit cheaper. The safari was good fun, the highlight was the tram ride. Below a quick summary.Getting there- difficult, give yourself plenty of time. NS is quite a bit out of town and involves MRT and bus (we went for the safari shuttle which is super confusing about how to pay/whether your MRT is valid etc) in the end the nice driver just let us on. getting home... if you can afford it I would advise taxi, bit ques lots of people, general chaos late at night. Once inside we opted to do the tram ride, it was a big que but it went down quickly, good opportunity to see lots of animal up close. After this you have the opportunity to do some walks which were nice and see some shows, which we didn't see due to time. Overall good experience, well worth doing but be prepared for lots of people."
It was interesting to see animals at night - not doing a lot to be fair but there was a range of wildlife to see. Couldn't get into the Creatures of the Night show as all performances fully booked. Tram ride was a good way to see the zoo but recommend doing the walking trails.
Wasnt sure what to expect if this due to the mixed reviews however I'm glad we went. There was a long wait in the queue for the tram- however it wasn't too hot and the long queue was moving steadily along. We enjoyed the tram ride and saw most of the animals. The walking trails were really enjoyable- something different for us. Skip the rainforest lumina!
"The night tour is really a good experience as soon as you are aboard their coaches (although they could think about electrifying those - less noise and smell... - but that is a different topic); nevertheless the waiting time until you are able to board one of the coaches is VERY long, thus reducing the fun of the overall action."
"So this is one of the more interesting things to do in Singapore. The lines are long and it is worth paying the $10 for the short line express pass. There is an ok amount of animals, and they put them in areas that that makes it easier to see them. It is however hard to see them. Also, you want to definitely get out and walk so you can get closer to some animals."
"After waiting so long to get on a tram, we weren't sure what to expect. But it was fantastic. A great experience. If you don't have young children, I would recommend walking as this looked even better than the tram. Best part of all the zoo experiences!"
Before even entrering crowds were mulling and loud and bigWe thanked the Gods wed paid extra for the adventure safariWas worth it just to avoid huge crowdsHugeOur own guide who was a charming gent whos name started with J kind and informativeMade sure my 70yo mum was ok and plenty of restWe had priority seating for night show- fun and some cute crittersThen our own private buggy stopping very close to displays and getting personal insight whilst the crowds trundled byMost animals out and i wonder are they like shift workersWe even got to feed elephantsI do think for the price they could include entry tickets and some chilled water but there are water fueling stations through outNot amazingBut decent treat yourself fun
"An interesting concept where you take a 30-min bus drive with an audio guide to see the nocturnal animals. We couldn't see all the animals, because it was dark and some of them were hiding.We didn't do the night walk as we were extremely tired after spending the entire day at the park.The animal show was quite entertaining.I would not suggest doing both the main ZOO and the night safari on the same day as it might be a bit too much and you will mostly see the same animals."
"We had a good night out at the Night Safari. It was poorly organised through the the hotel, and was thus very rushed, but we still had fun. I would recommend going on a bus tour, as they get priority boarding in the tour buses. So it saves you waiting in line for hours. There is no flash photography, so not much use taking your camera."
"An amazing experience to see the animals at close after the sun sets. When I went the sun didn't set until 7:15 so I couldn't experience the night views from the tram. But went around on foot and could catch the sights of many animals. I went there on a Sunday, so it was super busy. Try to go on weekdays."
"I went to this zoo with 3 of my friends. Its a night safari zoo so its open at night. We book the ticket by online and because we dont know after bought the ticket we still need to choose the time, then finally we can go in at 9.15. At 9.30 there was a place for us too see some kind of animal, after that we surrounded the zoo by using the zoo car and after that we went by walk. It was nice experience for us!"
this is a huge and well maintained zoo.You do need to leave some time to get around the zoo.The night safari is busy but also an excellent way to see some of the great animals we live with.The zoo is a distance from the city
Got tickets for 8:15 and went straight in to get seats for show at 8:30. (They let you in about 8am). After the show we avoided the tram queue and went and walked the 4 trails (takes about 60-80 mins) and then got on the tram for the tram tour about 10pm. Need to keep in mind that last shuttle from Zoo->Khatib MRT is 10:40pm if you want to use that one. We got tickets for the rainforest Lumina but ran out of time to do this as well this visit. Was a bit of queuing but was worth the trip. Quite a bit of walking and a late night of taking young kids!
"a new way of visiting a zoo, nice experience. Only problem was the heavy rush & long waiting time. Overall great."
"I was thrilled when my boyfriend told me that we are going to night safari. I guess I expect too much about it. Honestly speaking, I did not really enjoyed it. But I was happy seeing those animals that are new to me. If you are planning to visit night safari, it's better to go on a group tour because they have the priority pass which is less hassle and not going to stay on the queue."
"Little disappointing. Not too many animals to see - they were either hiding or asleep.The whole tram ride was very dark. But the commentary in English was good.Always very busy, so pay the extra for a priority tram ride or you will be cueing behind hundreds of others."
Friends and I went to 9:15pm time slot and it the wait time wasn't too bad at all. The staff were friendly and helpful. The safari was really enjoyable and informative. They care about the animals and the environment. We also saw the show which was entertaining.
Staff is friendly. There is enough signboard to direct you when to go. There is a lot of taxi around for transportation back after closing.
Overall was a great tour n great show. Tram queue too long - we were not told of expectation of how long we are going to wait n what will be ahead of us. Staff quite helpful. Tram tour is good.
"Definitely a very unique experience of combining a safari experience, with the safety of a zoo and the thrill of the night! The tram ride lasts about 45 minutes and takes you through a series of animals including lions, tiger, hyenas, wolfs, multiple types of deers, elephants and rhinos! We were lucky to see almost all of them, except maybe one. The animals are pretty close to you but some have smaller fences around them or a water stream between you and them.There are 2 shows that happen, one fire show outside and another interactive animal show inside. The tricky part with these shows is that they are dependent on the weather. At the slightest of rains they can be cancelled. We were not able to see the shows as it was drizzling when we were there.The safari is very far away from the main part of the city and you will need to dedicate a full evening to do this (a full day if you do the other zoo attractions as well). Also, the price seemed a bit too much keeping in mind that it was more than any other attraction we had gone to in Singapore, except Universal Studios which is a full day attraction! Also, if the shows don't happen, your ticket price still deosn't change.Worth attending for sure but definitely seems expensive!"
"An enjoyable experience for all as they have a variety of animals you can view in their natural habitat. We took the 45 minute tram ride around the rainforest and also got a ticket to the Creatures of Night Show which is an interactive experience with the animals. Spoiler alert' they walk across the seating area with owls, for example. They're pretty punctual with timings too."
A must visit place in Singapore specially when you visit with your family. Nicely managed zoo and informative.
We came with our 2 kids (6 and 12). We bought discounted tickets online the same day and weren't able to pick an entry time until we got up to the zoo at 6.30pm. By then the 7.15pm and 8.15pm entry times were gone so we chose 9.15pm. We hadn't realised at the kiosk that we were selecting entry times and thought it was tour times. When we then tried to enter figuring we'd walk some trails first we were surprised to find out we'd have to wait 2 hours. I think they felt sorry for us and our genuine shock so let us in anyway. There was a huge queue for the tram ride and the show was full so we got a stamp on our hands and came out to get some food. Not the best food but ok. We went back in at 8pm and just got a seat at the creatures of the night show as people had already been queuing and everyone coming off the earlier trans heads straight for the show. The show was ok but nothing great. We did some of the trails and the got the tram at 9ish. By this time there was no queue so if you can wait. Most of the animals are on the right hand side so sit there for best views. We got grab there and back S$22 and S$16. Worth it as it only takes 20 mins and no queuing.
We enjoyed our visit. As expected it was busy but this didn't dampen the enjoyment. We caught the Tram first and then walked the whole zoo. Not many people seem to walk it so it lets you linger longer at the enclosures with less people. The animal show was worth seeing as well. Unfortunately some animal feeding only happens on weekends. The only thing we found that was disappointing was the food on offer. Not that enjoyable. That aside it's a must visit.
Did a night safari with my kids. The lobby area is nice and has a sit down restaurant as well as fast food and some gift shops and an ice cream shop.The actual tram loop goes by pretty fast. I think we were only on the tram for about 40-45 mins. The rest of the time we walked 2 of the trails. The trails were good and offered better views of some of the animals.We caught a bit of the fire show at the end just before closing. People seemed to enjoy it and the performers stayed behind to take pictures with anyone who wanted one.
the queue for the tram itself is more arduous than the actual safari. Fast lane people taking their time did not help. Overall it was an enlightening (pun intended) experience-had no idea Singapore had its own elephants!the inability to take flash photography (understandable) meant I had no pictures to take back with me other than the really overpriced photo taken by the staff. The Creatures of the Night performance later was a good addition (and free) to the Night Safari!
"Before I signed up, I was wondering that any animals would show up at night and bug bites in the zoo. We took direct bus from Suntec city for SG $12 round trip. Arrived before 8pm. We were luckily to jump right on the tram ride. To my surprise, many animals showed up and my teenage boys enjoyed the whole ride. Then we continued to see 9:15 animal show. After that, we already ran out of time to take walk in the zoo because we had to catch last bus back to city. For the whole night, it was fun for my family and only one to two bug bites."
"Today my family and I visited the Night Safari. We were very disappointed that both animal shows (8:30 and 9:30pm) were full. We lined up for the first show right after the fire show outside and for the second show at 9:10pm. By that time both shows were full and we left the facilities without having the opportunity of enjoying the shows. I find this very frustrating because it is a non-sense that you pay a ticket, get to the entrance and then need to line-up for at least 45 minutes to get a chance to come into a show. Please take into account that we were there 20 minutes before each of the shows and they were already full.The rest of the experience was very good. However my kids and I are disappointed from our visit, as were other visitors that could not get into the shows."
Reached at the venue on time. Printed off ticket from kiosk. But then there were long queues which takes more than 30 minutes. Finally the cart came and we were on board.It's a great experience to see animals right close. Don't use mobile or camera flash as it distracts the animals.Very nice trip which lasts around 30 minutes. The best part is you don't have to walk but long queues spoil the experience to some extent. Otherwise it's a must try with young kids!!
"The night safari is an interesting way to see animals in a nocturnal setting. Very popular, so expect long lines. Singapore in general has quite poor directional signage and attractions do not understand line/crowd management basics, so be prepared for that. The zoo is very far from downtown and transit gets you close but there is final shuttle you need with its own ticket which is challenging to figure out."
We arrived by the shuttle bus from Khatib at 8pm. We had to queue for around 20 minutes before getting on to a tram but it wasn't that bad. it got a lot quieter soon after so we arrived at the tail end of the peak time. The tour was really good and got very close to a lot of the animals which we didn't expect. It was nice to see so many of the animals so active and there was a great variety. We then took the walking trails after the tram which were also good and got us close to a lot of the animals. Overall great experience and would highly recommend!
Despite the weather being awful with a torrential downpour when we arrived the Night safari was very enjoyable. The animals seemed more active at night than when we visited later in the week in the day. We spent around hours in total walking the trails and then on the guided tram ride.
Here you have enough animals.Deers are common.Well maintained.You can see all the animals that they say.
This place opens up around 7.30 pm and finishes around 11 pm.There are massive queues so important to book on line the time in advance.You first go see a night show in an arena of various animals / Birds coming out to the Rangers .After that you queue up for the tramride which takes you through the Jungle type atmospgete and you get to see the animals in their natural environment. Its a unique tramride and you enjoy the appox 30 minutes ride through the Jungle trail.Would recommend this place.There are restaurants around to tuck in and have drinks.
"Singapore Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo. It is an entire open-air night zoo. It is divided into seven geographical zones, which can be explored either on foot via four walking trails, or by tram. The naturalistic enclosures simulate the animals' native habitat. Animals are separated from visitors with natural barriers, rather than caged. Flash photography was strictly not allowed. Cultural performances are a regular feature at the safari, and include tribal dances, blowpipe demonstrations and fire eating displays. Creatures of the Night Show is a performance presented by the animals in the Night Safari. Found this to be an awesome experience."
Its definitely better than any other zoo I have been to. But it didn't amaze me. Probably it didn't live up to the hype.
"We thought this place was hectic. Everyone clearly arrives at the same time. They need to work out a better glow, as it's a great product offering."
"It seems like the Night safari is busy no matter whenever you visit. I have visited many times since its opening and I don't think it's as good as it used to be. The Creatures of the Night show featured lots of animals but the one I saw didn't feature the surprise snake which was a shame. The automated voice now on the tram is a real disappointment because other guests don't respect and listen to it like they used to when it was a human speaking and sharing their knowledge. The walking trails have changed as well and I miss the Bridge of Suspense. The Night Safari is still a great evening out, but some small changes I think have meant it's not as good as it used to be."
"This is good fun and well worth seeing although it's expensive and over-run with tourists! If only they would keep the numbers down, we wouldn't all be trampled by mainlanders."
Enjoyed night safari more than normal zoo because it was more animal orientated. Loved the interactive activities
"Overall an interesting experience. You do get to see a couple of animals, but, the tram moves and it doesn't stop near the enclosures. we just get a glimpse of the animals. Moreover, its dark, hence one has to really focus your eyes. Secondly, enclosures are on both sides of the road , hence we don't get any clear view on the other side .Its an enjoyment trip for kids . So, if not doing anything in the evening, take this night safari. Do wear comfortable clothes . There are eateries there , so you can eat after the trip . They do click your photos with an interesting background and sell it for $20 hardcopy."
Good but have to wait in long que to board there cart wait time more than 2 hours strange could have been organised by organizers in better way
"very nice experience , certainly the walk around in the night is very special and it's great to see the animals in the dark, however some are just sleeping, but overall it's great"
I do this at least once or twice a year and my daughter and myself enjoy ourselves all the time. The place remains very well kept and the environment and atmosphere is fantastic. I love the selection of animals and the very natural setting. My only disappointment this time is that some of the enclosures seems to be empty.
"The night safari was excellent. My wife, 4 year old son, 7 year old daughter and I were not disappointed by the animals large and small that were actively walking and eating during our tram ride. Since my kids were rested through the day they could walk the trails to see the other animals like the leopards etc. The only criticism I will give is that the food available outside the park is terribly expensive and of small portions and is a poor reflection on the park. I suggest you look at improving the price, portions and options available."
A different take from your normal zoo. Our kids had a wonderful time though visually challenging at times when they have trouble seeing the animals but amazed when a tiger suddenly jumps out.
Very interesting trip.We really had the impression of a night safary somewhere in the wilderness.You should plan to have enough time to walk around.
Took the walking trail and saw some cute fishing cats. Took the tram and brought us to some areas only accessible by the Tram. Overall is good. I would really appreciate the tram vehicle could stop for a while for us to take photograph when any animal spotted.
"We did the night safari on our second night in singapore, and booked it through our travel agent which we were glad we did as we got a priority pass for the tram passing a very long queue. This also ment we got dinner before the tram which was OK but we didn't feel too great a few hours after, be wary of the spicy foods. Its a good set up in all, the tram takes you through sections of the park you can't walk through and it's lovely to see animals that you wouldn't in a regular zoo. The tram was also very informative and we got very close to some free roaming animals which was unexpected and lovely to experience. All the animals seem to be well looked after and have relitively good size enclosures from what we could see. The walking bits were also very good, however it did feel a bit crowded at times as some of the pathways were quite narrow and a lot of people were pushing and shoving past. The gift shops were also good, large selection of goods to choose from so it was easy to pick a momento."
"We absolutely loved the Night Safari! It's an experience like no other - and totally, definitely unmissable if you're visiting Singapore - whether you have kids with you or not. The only disappointing factor was that we didn't realise there are really 3 parts to the Night Safari : A self walking tour, a show, as well as the little bus/tram that takes you around on a tour. We booked our tour time (as we were, & do recommend). We filled in time at the River Safari until the gates opened & then went & had dinner at the night safari (as all food outlets at the River Safari had closed by the time we finished) while we waited for our allocated time slot. What we didn't realise was - we could have been doing our walking tour during this time. Consequently, we wasted time having dinner, then did our bus tour at allocated time, went to show, then had to really rush around our walking tour before the park closed. I would recommend eating before the Night Safari opens, do the walking tour first, then either bus tour or show."
"Best place to go if you are an animal lover who wants a night time experience.Pros: escape singapore heatNot much walking(if you choose tram ride)Short trip ( can be done below 3 hrs)Creatures of night show a mustCons:Short tram rideYou can't always find animals awake or activeThere might be long queue for the tram ride,avoid trip during weekends."
I took my visitors there last month and was quite disappointed with the high entrance fee and the downsizing in number of animals on display. The tram ride had done away with the midway stop for visitors to walk among the exhibits. The only pleasant surprise was the addition of the animal show. It's worth making time to watch.
Where the Zoo was even greater than in the past. The Night Safari disappointed somewhat. Al lot of animals could just not be seen. Pity.
"I visited here with my family, a kid and older parents. Not recommended for Older people specially the one who cannot walk. They ask you to check out first place in right where you sit and see a show, well I thought it will be great show with lots of things but it was just normal show not something like oh I would have missed it. Later they ask you to take safari which will show all animals on right and left not so close pretty far ... it's a zoo. My kid is 3 years and she hardly enjoyed.Finally you have choice outside to eat good ice cream and some Indian food. Not so much great to visit again."
"This place indeed great place but too overcrowded. Due to this reason, we missed the walking tour in search for nocturnal animals. The only option we had was to visit a amphitheater and go for tram tour around the place. Nonetheless, the animals we kept in an open space so that they can move freely, no captive animals, that's the great part of Night Safari. To manage overcrowds, we strongly recommended to Wildlife Reserve Singapore to sell limited tickets so that people management can be better and worthy to utilize all the activities provided by Night Safari management. We can understand it's business and a profit organization, but little focus on customer centricity would highly appreciable."
"Night Safari is over-rated. It was a big crowd around the New Year and it was like quite a mechanical experience. Started by trudging in a queue, being thrown in an open bus/cart, and driven around the park, with pre-recorded audio playing over our heads, looking at shrouded figures of animals and finally being herded back to the exit! Most of the animals looked strangely slow and as if sedated. The views are obscured and dull. The pre-recorded audio guide is unimaginative. To have a pre-recorded guide for a safari was strange in itself. It all looked pretty scripted. Even the show that we wanted to watch got cancelled."
Very disappointed in the night safari. If you have young children they will love seeing the animals in the dark if not give it a miss or try the zoo instead. Tram does not give you enough time to see the animals and quite a few were nowhere to be seen very underwhelming to say the least
"When buying ticket for night Safari, the rainforest Luminar is a compulsory bundle. However after the trip at the Safari, there is virtually no time for the rainforest Luminar anymore, let alone catching the last bus to MRT station which ends before or exactly at the Safari closure.A Chinese guy was seen selling 'discounted' online tickets before the official ticketing booth, giving reasons of selling off unused tickets from friend which obviously was made up. A scalper indeed but not regulated, shouldn't have happened in Singapore."
On the night we were there too many tickets had been slid an the queues were very long. Trip was fine but spoiled somewhat by the delays.
"After having read the reviews and being animal lovers we decided to go on the night safari.....Do not waste your money ,visit the zoo during the day far better valueThe show with the animals was ok but nothing to stand outThe Team ride around the safari park was at times laughable,as they announce what you MIGHT see ,but all to often saw nothing....and seeing 12 different types of deerWas not that inspiredGive this a miss and visit the Zoo"
After reading the reviews and talking to others we weant to the Night Safari. After going to the zoo last time in Singapore and loving evey minute we thought we had better do the night safari.I'm sorry to say we were disappointed. The tram wizzed through barely pausing anywhere to see the what animals were actually out and about. We then did the walk but rude pushy people aside most animal were either sleeping or trying to get into their areas to sleep.Perhaps it was the time we goit the tram at 8:30pm and walked arounf from about 9:20pm but it was a let down from what the day trip presented.
"I went on this safari few days ago.This was my first ""Night Safari"", so I don't have anything to compare this to.However, I am going to describe my experience.We went on a week day thinking that there would be less crowd. However, we experienced very long queues.The safari trip was interesting and got the chance to see many nocturnal animals active. This was difference from my past experiences in day time safaris.It is a good thing that the Zoo promotes the environmental conservation.The total ride was about 40 - 45 minutes excluding queuing times and the animal show.After that we went to have the dinner and there was an Indian buffet which was highly overpriced. For the amount they charge, they could at least double the options they offer.Anyway, the food was in acceptable condition.I think this is a good experience to have."
"The Night Safari is not worth 50 SGD if you have ever been on an African Safari. The animals, which may or may not be visible, are mostly viewed from a small tram you are herded onto. They are mostly eating their evening meal or laying about. The demonstration show would be fun for children, but not so much for adults. After doing the above activities and waiting in the long lines we decided not to walk one of the trails so can't tell you if better animal viewing was possible."
"My daughter enjoyed her night safari experience; I had made the experience back in 2007 and enjoyed it much more then. This time we booked online well in advance, for the 9:15 pm entrance. As the trip to the night zoo from downtown takes at least an hour with the MRT and a bus, we arrived very shortly before 9;15 pm. There was a huge queue and we got in around 9:35 pm. There was then another queue for the tram, so we decided to skip that and walk the four well mapped routes through the night zoo. That option is more enjoyable than the tram ride, which is noisy as many tourists (especially Chinese and Indian ones) disregard appeals for quiet. Many of the enclosures are poorly lit so you will have to make a big effort to spot the animals, provided they are night active and pace around their enclosure. Many of them aren't so you won't see them. Can't help feeling that the entire operation has become big business."
"Because the Night Safari at the zoo was recommended to us, we were excited to go, and we did enjoy seeing the zoo & animals at night. The trip (by taxi) took longer than expected, though, and there was a fair amount of waiting in line--but these were managed fairly well. The one thing I really objected to was the exhaust from the car in front of us on the long trolley: the smell made me dizzy. Such emissions aren't good for passengers or animals. In this day & age, the zoo should switch over to solar electric power. There's so much sun in Singapore that the long term should easily cover the initial investment. Every organization (and every person) should do its part to fight climate change."
This experience had been recommended to us by everyone we know that has visited Singapore and potentially had set our expectstions high.We decided to go on an organised tour due to hearing stories about the mega lines of tourists when going solo. I recommend this as we were guided straight onto the trolley tour.The concept of the night zoo is great but I have to say I was a little disappointed. We didn't see as many animals as I'd expected and the tour only went for 30ish minutes.I probably wouldn't recommend this as a must do for a visit to Singapore.
"I purchased the tickets online and selected our entrance time. Naively I thought, oh with pre-determined times there must not be a lot of people. Wrong! The queue to the tram was huge. The tour is nice, well put and designed. They do a good job ensuring the animals are visible. There are 2 beginning trails - fishing cat or wallaby. From there you can decide to continue onto other trails or return. The park closed at midnight so we couldn't do it all. There is a creature of the nights show which we watched but I don't recommend. It was a waste of time. Nothing special about it. I wish the trams stopped more so we could take decent pictures. All in all, ok activity to do with the children but make sure you plan it well."
"The zoo is quite a long way from the city centre (approximately 30 minutes by taxi) and has more of a theme park feel than most zoos I have visited with no shortage of fast food and lots of retail opportunities.I asked for one adult and one over 60 concession but was told that the concessions were only available to Singapore residents! This is clearly a zoo policy - at other attractions such as The Botanic Gardens, Maritime Museum, Asian Civilisation museum, Indian Heritage museum etc etc we were invited to make use of the concessionary rates.So, after paying $57 each (over Â£30 each) we were told that the next block entry would be at 8.15pm - a wait if around 2 hours with nothing on offer other than shopping or eating.After queuing at our allotted time we decided to do the walking trails first as the line for the tram was very long. The trails were enjoyable and we got to see a lot of animals in their nocturnal states.We then queued for the tram ( the walking trails do not cover all the enclosures). Quite a long wait made longer by staff bringing several rows of people behind us forward!The tram ride was enjoyable and informative.The zoo says it supports wildlife conservation indeed the tickets tell us that for every $57 ticket sold they donate 50cents to conservation.In summary this is a different experience and one that I enjoyed but the cost, the queues and the theme park feel means I really can't recommend it."
"We booked a slot that we thought may be less busy but my goodness the reviews we had read were very accurate!We had an awfully long wait and there was NOWHERE to sit. In the blistering heat we had no choice but to buy drink after drink to stay cool and have something to do in the meantime, which was walk round & round - there is a performance that takes place on the stage near the bar - but I couldn't tell you what it was as you cannot see through the crowds, I assume it was fire breathing or something similar perhaps due to the smell of smoke and spirit.The place is RAMMED. There are simply endless people walking at / around you.The organisation of (or lack of) for entry through a ""flash your ticket"" system is dire and means that people flock to the available staff - usually two - to show their ticket and start queuing. Once you get through this bit you then queue to go through and queue again for the transport. This is chaotic, busy and there is lots of queue jumping. It's highly annoying and terribly organised so be prepared!Having said that, once you are in and on your way, it's actually lovely but again, be prepared for the ignorant tourists who choose to talk so loudly that you can miss the whole audio element of the tour.You need a really good camera for pics and once you start your own tour by foot it is great. We also did the Rainforest Lumina at the end of the night, which was absolutely wonderful and much quieter.Overall, it's fairly well priced but the lack of organisation and facilities was a let down. If you go as a family, with an elderly person or a person who is less able bodied then you will struggle here - before entry particularly.Staff are lovely and most helpful - our phones ran out of power whilst we waited - but just a shame that a lack of organisation can be enough to put you off before you even begin."
"We went on a Thursday night during the Christmas/ new year week. Extremely high people traffic!Night safari in itself was enjoyable. I would give the trams a miss if you have comfy walking shoes and don't mind following trails and map guides.The whole park takes about 1.5 hours.All the animals were out and about.A few pacing animals which were concerning.Creatures Of the night show not too spectacular... the safari itself is more of a highlight.The disappointment was that the show's messages are about reuse reduce recycle: however all the night safari eateries serve their food in single use plastics everywhere!!Seems very tokenistic to say that, I would love to see more action!Super long queues for taxis at the end of the night. We waited 40 mins for a taxi! If you have grab app or can order a taxi before the last show ends, do it!"
"Given the ravishing reviews , a warm welcome to Disneyland where wild animals are exposed to high pitch music, never ending visitors by safari vans or foot . Truly sad to have seen extremely tiny enclosures where leopards, tigers and porcupines are running around in circles! The acclaimed wild life protection succumbed to the profit margin. Your choice if you want another artificial animalentertainment encounter!"
Animal sightings rare. Vehicle rushes past enclosures not giving any halt any where to view animals. You are lucky if you can see a few. Feel cheated at the end.
"We did the 7:15pm after the Singapore Zoo and Boy! was it crowded. There was a performance at the entrance while we were waiting for the gates to open and we did the Creatures of the Night show in the very beginning.. Do try to sit somewhere in the middle and avoid the corner benches if you can, as there are mosquitoes and the trees and shrubs block much of the corner views .. The arena is sprayed with bug killers and I believe Eucalyptus oils too but the corners do not get much coverage. The tram ride that followed soon after had such a maze of a queue and we spent around 30-40 min just moving around in the queues.The ride itself was a bit harrowing as we were quite straining to see the animals against faint lighting and didn't quite enjoy the same except for the lovely night breeze that was incredibly calming... it could also have been early for the night animals at our time and maybe visitors to the park after 9 pm may have had a better experience.Overall felt that the Zoo and the River Safari offered a much better fulfilling experience."
"Our first impression wasn't very good. We did the night safari after visiting the Singapore zoo. The zoo closes at 6pm and the night safari only opens at 7.15pm. That leaves you with over an hour to fill with nothing but bad food options. When the night safari opened, the performance at the entrance and the creatures of the night show had been cancelled due to weather conditions (it had been raining slightly all day). So we queued to take the tram around the park. We ended up in a tram filled with very loud, rude and disrespectful people, which totally ruined the experience. After 20 minutes of getting increasingly annoyed, we got off the tram and did the walking trails around the park. This was much nicer and quieter. The park is only dimly lit, so there were a lot animals that we didn't see as it was too dark. You do get a nice feeling of walking in a moonlit park. When we walked all the trails, we went on the tram again. This time there were no queues and only 10 people in the tram. Which made for a very good experience, we could clearly see the animals on both sides of the tram and hear the recording with information on the animals and the park. This was at about 9.45pm. So in my experience it's definitely worth waiting until after 9pm to enter the park. You will still have enough time to see everything."
"Think I expected too much from this especially after having done the zoo in the day. You have to get a time to enter such as 7.15pm or 8.15pm (but opened at 6.50pm) Straight to the Creatures of the night show for 7.15pm average saw a white racoon, owls, cat, snake and otters..Onto the tram which I gather on a really busy night could be a wait to get on. Most animals were not nocturnal and were either not there, too dark to see them or were asleep. Many we had just seen at the zoo in the day in a much nicer environment.Persisted with the 3 walk trails and again many not nocturnal and many missing or asleep and very dark walk..Disappointed in this and after a hot day at the zoo the tram was that boring I almost fell asleep. Have to say Animal kingdom at Disney's safari tour was better and they are not even a proper zoo..."
You will have to wait quite a while to ride the tram.And it's too dark to see the animals.Don't expect too much.
You might be thinking of wild and dangerous animals but its not true..its ohk ohk place..repeated animals and low visibility during night..
We have had long lines to wait for a short ride of 30 min and we saw very few animals. We were expecting a little bit more.
"Prior to going to the night safari I purchase a multi park pass which did prove to be an excellent way to see all the attractions.The night safari was a little underwhelming, I get that it is night time but the animals we a little far from the vehicle and therefore made it particularly difficult to see them.There is plenty to do around the night safari entrance and the restaurants were full of people waiting their turn to ride the night train around the park. We attended the 7:30 pm session and don't know if the time made a difference to the animals and there interactions with the tour.I would recommend this attraction to people but suggest you search other reviews to see if there is a better time of night to ride the train."
It was relaxing for me and my children enjoyed seeing the animals but it is done too late and it was very far for us. The tickets are very expensive and it is not really my type of thing to do.
"When we reached there at 645, the 715 tickets were sold out, so we waited for the 815 entry. It was a sat night so there was a crowd, waited for the tram ride for 30mins. Althg there were annoucments to remind visitors to keep volumes down during the tram ride, there were still people who are noisy. After the ride, we went to the creatures of the night show but the show was cancelled due to slight rain. Overall we felt it was over priced. If u have to go- try weekday nights & they have free entry for birthday months(not sure if it applies to tourists), go check it out at their website."
"I understand many will not agree with me however this attraction has changed over the years and has lost its charm. Firstly you book and allotted time for the tram 7.15, 8.15, 9.15 all have 1000 spaces. After we finally did the 7.15 tram ride the show was fully booked no spaces till the 9.30 show room for only 750 persons. For us a one & half hour wait. Last transportation bus to MRT leaves at 10 40pm, just all didn't work out. In my opinion it's just far overbooked and we left feeling very disappointed. FYI went to the zoo in the daytime and had a great experience. I would not do again and unfortunately would not recommend. What's happening with the animals & conservation is great but they've lost the human side to the almighty dollar."
Hardly any animals to see. Disappointing.Very expensive place.Day zoo would be a lot better. Good shade during the day.
"Very long wait for tram 1 (to do the night safari). Possible to do the safari on foot but with two tired kids, we waited almost an hour in the queue. Tip: go on the tram first and the night creature show after.After having seen a few animal shows (birds of prey in Alsace France, China, Manila) I wasn't impressed. It's a very simple show but I won't spoil the surprise.The actual safari takes about 35 mins, there's no wow factor. Getting to the zoo from downtown then queuing for so long zapped my energy. However for kids it's ok. The souvenir shop is totally generic (I already had a few of the items). SG is expensive so the tickets were also expensive. There's a short fire show that's impressive just after the entrance.Hope you will have a better time than we did. Regarding transport we took a grab to east park and it was 30$ vs the transport offered at 50$"
"We went to the night safari as kind of spontaneous act, as the city centre is occupied by F1. Besides the fact that it takes a long time to get there, the night safari exceeded our expectations.We unfortunately arrived there rather late, but got to take the tram ride and see many of the animals up close. Next time we will take the walk to have more time at the individual animals. It was very nice to see that there we no actual cages.Next up was the creatures of the night show, and though it was a great show, it still hurts to see ""trained"" wild animals - how do you think they have been trained. My appeal is simple: Stop animal cruelty and let the wild animals be wild.Last but not least we went to the rainforest lumina, which is truely awesome made and had some very funny initiatives.While writing this review I am very torn, as I dispise animal cruelty but could also see that there has been done things to give the animals there space and the rainforest lumina is a must for everyone young and old."
The Night Time Safari is highly overrated. It is crowded and commercial. The display of nocturnal animals is underwhelming. It is very expensive and not worth the cost and time.
"Just went to night safari last week. Overall, it was an exciting and fun night to explore animals. Until we rushed to the rainforest lumina and being told that we are not allowed to enter due to the Wild Birthday condition. Early that day, we have been told that our tickets included both venues while we purchase our tickets. We're okay if you guys told us early. Not one say can, another say cannot. Haiz.. why ask us to pay both since cant enter? Anywhere, WRS still recommended!"
"Unfortunately my experience at the Safari wasn't the best though I will admit I went on a Sunday night when the place was packed. The main issue was you were herded like cattle and left to wait in very, very long lines.Once on the tram though, things looked up and there were plenty of animals to see. What was also interesting is the way in which they manage the animals... keep them away from one another without the obvious use of fences.Try a week night. You may have a better experience."
"We went at night safari at night at around 8pm.After ordering dinner there itself, we then headed to the animal show. We found it to be entertaining but not extraordinary. After that we went to the safari trail which lasted around 45 minutes. There, we were introduced to nocturnal animals grazing peacefully in their "" natural"" habitat. After that it was too dark to go wander around. We therefore found the tickets to be a bit overpriced just for 2 activities which we managed to do at night time. Overall, we do recommend to go if you are an animal lover. However in our opinion, we believe that there are better places of interest to visit in Singapore."
"It is a nice place to spend a couple of hours, but the tickets are quite expensive. Good places for people who have never been to zoo before!"
"Night Safari is located along with Singapore zoo and it is a little far from main city but we'll connected by buses. Starts after 7 pm, I had visited around 10 pm and the shows were already over. Had to just go through the tram across the zoo at night. Animals are located very close by the tram path. However it was a short trip costing around 46 SGD, not worth the price."
a Zoo safari...you keep wondering why the animals dont cross their borders...and definitely dont behave as in their natural habitat. Visibility is somewhat poor. Long queues so be prepared to wait. Not a must visit but worth visiting.
"A zoo is place where we could teach our kids what elephants look like, rhinos, flamingos... etc (otherwise it'll be just a place for animal captivity!). Well, night safari is not the right place to do that. At the entrace, we were greeted by lines of gift shops, and then restaurants (is this a mall or something?)Then there's this queue for the tram ride. We didn't queue for a long time since I've read the review and so we arrived there 6.45pm (on Friday).The tram ride is so so.. I feel like duration is too short, too many deer-like animals (my kids even said 'why are we seeing deers again?') and the tram's length itself is too long so that the passangers at the rear end couldn't even see anything!After the tram ride ended, we went to see the night show.... which was also so so. Nothing impressing, animals appeared less than a minute (like they're in rush or something). Owls appeared just once.... sorry, but super boring.And that's it. For 46SGD, tbh it's not worth it. Our journey ended with the night shows, unless you want to walk the trail (in the middle of the night with very small chances to see anything) - no thanks. Better to do something else , just go to river safari or singapore zoo instead."
"A very small conservatory that can be completed within 30 min by foot, however there's this part of the place that can't be seen unless you take the tram. So, the queue for the tram is horrendously long and in a really warm environment. Standing in line was not the major issue, but screaming kids in the quiet habitats of the animals was really bad. There should be a reminder for parents to educate their children to be more considerate.Staffs of the night safari were really helpful, patient and nice! Thank you guys for the assistance and I'm sure it must not have been easy working there, but you make the environment great for us."
"It is something too late to finish the tour at night, and I got to take the last shuttle to go the the MRT and arrived the hotel at might night. I think it would be better if we can arrive the zoo before the sunset, because it toke a long time to admission.Well the Night Safari is so funny."
"it was alright, i think its just too crowded when every tour people arrives.. its just too crowded.."
Avoid visiting during public holidays. Too crowded and Long queue every where can be quite irritating.
Firstly the zoo is a LONG bus ride through very heavy traffic only to find that a significant percentage of the population of Singapore is also at the zoo. It was a mob scene. Thank heaven we had priority tram passes and entrance tickets because there was a 1-2 hr wait for admission then another 1-2 hr wait for tram boarding. That being said I would skip the tram ride. It crawls through the exhibits that you could see much better by walking the trails. The exhibits were nicely done but not in the league with say San Diego. Some of the animals were exhibiting confinement stress by pacing back and forth; rather sad. As would be expected it was hot and humid but there was also a smell of petroleum that was very unpleasant. The trams appeared to be electric powered so perhaps it was a mosquito treatment. The concept of nocturnal viewing is interesting but the zoo needs to refine the product and limit the number of tickets sold. If you do go book a tour. The tour guide is entertaining and the priority status a must.
"I have to admit I was looking forward to this event because of what I had been told, but I was very disappointed. There were far too many people than the facilities could cope with, and I had the impression that this was all about making money. We had to wait for over 45 minutes to catch the tram which took you around the zoo. When we had finished, the queue was just as long as when we had started. We couldn't wait to get out of the zoo. The 'Creatures of the Night' show was OK."
"We had to line up for 1/2 hr to get tickets for the 7:15pm tour then another 1/2 to board the safari shuttle and then we hardly saw a single animal and when we did it was too dark to really even see them. I would definitely not recommend this for children, they will be bitterly disappointed! No photos to add as there was nothing to see!"
We had a lovely evening but it was totally disorganised. I booked tickets for 6.30pm but when we arrived it was not clear exactly what the tickets were for. There was a show at 6.30pm but also a large queue was forming for the tram. Nobody could really advise us what to do. We opted for the tram ride and waited 40 minutes even though we were members. This was disappointing. The ride was excellent with lots of animals on show. However when it finished we were hoping to go to the show at 7.30pm but it was full. We went on one of the trails and watched the 8.30pm show.I just think it could be so much better organised and more infuriation should be given on what's there to do. You should have a time for the tram and a separate show time.
"The bane of all vacations is always upgrading, scaffolding and renovations! Night Safari was undergoing some form of renovations, during the June/July 2019 period when we visited with overseas friends, probably to make it better.You cannot stop at the East Lodge, on the tram ride, get off, and walk around, to see the giraffes, which were missing, as their enclosure was undergoing upgrading/renovations.Also in the middle island, there used to be a nice swing bridge, but that's gone now, and it's being replaced by waterfall, like we need more artificial waterfalls.Overall, I thought a few additions and upgrades to the park were nice, especially for the tram rides, but for overseas friends, they wanted to take some time to walk the safari, and soak in the nocturnal feeling of it all, which they could not due to the renovations."
"I'm not sure it's possible to avoid weekend crowds unless you go on a very late tour. We waited over 1 hour to get on the tram. Visitors ignored multiple warnings about using flash photography. Even when not using flash, the screens from so many peoples phones were incredibly distracting. I live in Singapore. Doubtful if I will ever return with visitors."
"The whole idea of seeing nocturnal animals is a great one but the one problem is you are viewing them at night. In many cases it was difficult seeing the animals because it is dark. We were a group of approximately 40 people and after the walk in the nocturnal area you are offered to go on an a extended walk or go to a show. I think just about all 40 people had enough of the nocturnal animals, possibly because of what said above.The highlight of the evening was a show that they had in an arena with birds and other animals that are well trained to perform. This part should not be missed if you are here with kids. There are many food selections at the zoo with fast food as well as family style sit down eating."
"Wouldn't describe this as a must do on a Singapore trip.Buy tickets online for sure if you do come otherwise -Queue for ticketsQueue to get inQueue for tramCan quite easily be 20 mins / 30 mins / 45 mins and you haven't seen a thing! Tram trip is ok, but you don't see lots and over in about 25 mins. Queue takes longer than ride. You see more from walking the trails for sure. We did both. Entry tickets are staggered starting at 7.15pm / 8.15pm etc, big needs to change. Once you have entry the tram queue can be massive. If it is when you go don't bother - walk it!Can get there on MRT / bus from city but allow lots of time. Good 40 mins to park from MRT station and then time trip back to avoid missing last MRT (around 11.30pm / 11.45pm). Taxis can be difficult to get hold of at end as everybody leaves at same timeOther things to do instead of this in out opinion - think about it but if you do go be patient and enjoy the queues!!"
The tour is done in a open buggy train at night with animals to watch from a distance. While booking the tickets there are time slots mentioned but it's free for all once you reach and there is a huge queue to get to the buggy. Also the queue is in open so it's quite hot and humid. The actual tour duration is less than the time in the queue and there are fewer animals to watch in the night. The entire experience is very tiring and not worth the value
"<Before enter>Although purchased tickets on internet in advance, need to stand in a long queue to collect tickets. Be careful the ticket's condition. Moreover, one counter staff rejected my ticket collect request although I waited for long time in a queue while aligning another staff's indication after my consultation with him. Staff quality depends on each staff, but appreciate if the zoo encourage staffs.There are 4 time-slot to enter Night Safari such as 7:15pm, 8:15pm, 9:15pm and 10:15pm, but earlier time-slots were sold out soon on consecutive holidays. Thus, I could collect tickets for 9:15pm although I arrived at this zoo around 4:30pm.However, there are express pass as multi language tram ticket by S$10. When we have this pass, we can enter the zoo immediately even though I have later ticket. I recommend this way if you accept this cost.<After Enter>Honestly speaking, hard to see animals since they were hiding or lying on the ground and also darkness when I had been walking around the course.But, I could see while I have been riding the tram.My experience which I could see white lions was great for me.We saw a animal shows, and there were cute animals, so we enjoyed......We have been to Singapore Zoo before Night Safari. Singapore Zoo was soooo nice, thus we expected Night Safari is also so good as well. Unfortunately we were not so satisfied, but the zoo in the dark is rare experience.I wish your experience will be nice!!"
Glad we had booked online to skip that queue but then had to queue for ages to get on the tram.Was good once we were on it & there were only a couple of animals that we couldn't see. Some were so close that you could possibly reach out & touch them.I'm glad that I did it but wouldn't do it again.
"Nice experienceYou can see deers and antilopes eating in one meter distanceAlso lions, African elephants, rhinos and hipposAbout 30 minutesCould be much better anyway"
"I want to give this place a higher rating but they definitely need to improve their queue management. We bought tickets via Klook but it took us almost an hour to enter after they've opened the gates - the queue was very long (our tickets were for the 8:15 PM entry). We were supposed to line up for the tram but after being in line for several minutes and seeing how long the queue was, my husband decided that we should just do the walking trail. This turned out to be a good decision. This allowed us to go around the park and see the animals up close. The zoo seems well maintained and has a good selection of animals - very enjoyable particularly for young kids. We brought a stroller for our 5 year old son, so we were able to move him around quickly when he would tire from walking. While we enjoyed the walking trail, I was also concerned during this time if we will be able to catch the tram and see the show before the night was over. After going around for almost an hour to complete the walking trail, we were able to line up fairly quickly for the tram ride. At this time though, we had already missed the creatures of the night show (930 PM show) and the park was nearing closing time (already past 10 PM). From our experience, if you enter at 815 PM, you will not be able to see all the attractions - in our case, we just did the walking trail and tram but missed the show. The zoo needs to manage their queues better, maybe limit the tickets sold so their guests can still get a good solid experience and not feel like they need to be rushing to cover the entire place and enjoy all the attractions. Or maybe they can also adjust the timings so the park closes at a slightly later time and people can enjoy the place better. In terms of customer service, I didn't find the attendants very friendly, some were unsmiling or curt when you ask them questions. Suggest better training for them as well - they are part of the experience."
"Our expectations were very high for the Night Safari, we had been told by travel agents back home what a unique experience it was and many of the reviews on here really hype it up too.We found the experience to be quite different in reality.Firstly if you have booked online tickets you need to queue when you arrive to collect these tickets, this was over 20 minutes of queuing for us.We were then advised to start queuing for the entrance which I was surprised by as we had timed entrance tickets, so we queued for another 30 minutes to get in.Once we were in we queued for nearly an hour to get onto the train that takes you around to see the animals.So that was nearly 2 hours stood queuing before we saw any animals. We did have the opportunity to walk around parts first, but the trains stop at a certain time and there were so many people there that we were concerned that we would not get a ride on the train.The ride was shorter than I expected and we found after that you get a better chance to view the animals by walking around. A lot of the animals, lions, tigers, elephants etc you do see in most zoos in the days time, but there are some when you are walking around such as the sugar gliders that you don't.When leaving we found that there was a massive queue for the taxis and it was impossible to get a grab taxi to pick is up, but getting a bus a little way from the zoo and getting off we were easiily able to get a grab taxi to pick us up."
"Did the night safari. It was fun, but at the end of the day it was just a regular zoo and not worth the exorbitant price. The descriptions of the animals/exhibits are also much more lackluster than I expected."
"We booked the hop on hop off bus service to take us to the zoo for this activity. I was greatly surprised that there were so many people here. From queue up to finish it took us and hour and a half for a twenty minute ride through the zoo! Also there is the hour and a half return trip from town to the zoo. I would recommend if you don't mind queuing but otherwise forget it. Some of the animals were not visible or present and the ones that were were hard to see as they use white light instead of red so your eyes can never get adjusted to the darkness. On a good note, they say your attendance costs go towards preservation."
"We though the night safari will be a good choice, but we were disappointed. Big crowd and long queue to enter the facility. Are we there too early (7:30 pm) to see more animals as they are more active later at night? Most we saw were deer species, other interesting species were not to be seen. Some places the lighting were too dim to see anything."
"Great concept. Good tram ride, but the line was terrible (over 1hr wait, & a lot of people behind us got to go first), crowd control needs some work. Should of walked the trails, then take the tram ride later in the evening."
"Our family of 4 visited the night safari tonight and were underwhelmed. Our experience is probably in part due to our visiting many amazing animal attractions in Australia. The reaction from some visitors In the crowd was like they had never seen an animal before ...So in summary it is crowded, you wil que for everything, it is a hike from the city (taxi approx $30 and 30-40 mins each way) and the cost is substantial, if I had my time again I'd give it a miss."
It was extremely bad weather we went to visit so it was very unfortunate that the show was cancelled but overall it was a good visit. We didn't walk around either as the rain was so heavy but got on the little tram around and it was good overall.
"We (family of four) went on the night safari recently. Would not recommend it at this time of year. Upwards of 3,500 people did the night safari that evening and it was very crowded. Saw more from using the walking tracks than riding on the tram. Allowing less numbers in at one time would benefit the experience greatly."
"Very busy and hot, long lines for the tram and a little disappointed with the amount of animals seen. (We had an older family member so chose this mode of transport).On leaving ,the shuttle bus signs in wrong spot so quite a few people missed the next available bus back to MRT , they needed more buses at the end of evening/ closing time. Other family members who walked around the night safari enjoyed though."
Rained that night. Creatures of the Night show was canceled. Tram tour quite dark and most animals except deer were asleep. Hot dog was good though.
Too crowded with many many indian tourists. Super long queue for the only show available. We have to queue up more than 30minutes in order to watch the show. Should increase the show frequency n reduce waiting time as young children cannot wait so long.
We were so looking forward to this. It was spoilt by a really noisy family on our buggy ride. Screaming kids people on there phones. Wish we could have done it again and could hear the narrative about the animals. We recommend people are told to turn off there phones and please be quiet so all guests can enjoy the experience. We did complain when we got off. No one seemed to care.
"Our experience was very much affected by the huge crowds, particularly near the entrance. Only saved by diving out of the hordes, thanks to helpful staff, and doing the walking trails first. Unless you have children in tow we would avoid the shows. It was school holidays but research and choose your visit time carefully. The staff were great and helped us several times. So it is not a wild experience but could be fun at the right time."
"We arrived around 7pm for the 8:15 show. When we arrived, there weren't any staff to show where the line started, and were wandering around the entrance for about 10 minutes.We waited in the line for an hour and a half. The line was long because they mixed both 7pm and 8pm groups. When that was done, we went to another line for another hour. By the time we got inside the tour car, we were already tired, and sweating.That being said, the attractions and animals we saw were amazing and I was able to see new animals I'd never seen before.I hope to be back as soon as the problem is fixed."
"It is a nice experience, but the place was busy & congested. I expected to see more animals though. I believe the regular zoo visit would be more fun."
"So when I bought the tickets online as part of the 4 parks in 1 deal I chose a time slot. Little did I know the the rest of Singapore would be in at that time aswell !!!It was so busy it was quite overwhelming. We headed to the night show creatures of the night.. which is cute. But really we should have gone for a walk around first (which I recommend), then head to the show (8.30) then tram ride.We did show then stood in the tram queue for an hour and still hadn't got on. So decided to walk... but you don't see everything on the walk so need to do both! When we got back the queues were smaller.Nice to see Animals at night but this has a real zoo feeling and money making .. just mobbed with people.the leopards are in a tiny area and we're pacing back and forth and looked really sad. People were banging on windows and shouting loudly. But no staff around the trails to keep an eye out.We headed to the Illumination rainforest walk after this in the zoo part which we absolutely loved !"
"The night Safari itself is amazing. It takes 32 minutes, not 40min. The tour is highly recommend, but the waiting time NOT. We didn't expect such a long queue. We booked the safari on a Wednesday at 8.15pm. After the entry was a very long queue for the tram ride. We waited for 45 minutes. This is even longer then the tram ride. You can also walk through the zoo by night. You have 4 walking trails, each takes about 20 minutes. Last entry is at 10.15pm and at 11.45pm they start to kick you out because the zoo closes at midnight."
"We did this 10 years ago and i remember it being great.Not so great any more. Crowded, expensive food, the added cost of taxis to and from, but worst of all the chaos to queue and get on the safari itself. Total chaos and an hour of wasted time. I would not be advising friends to bother. The night is just too hard."
"We were a family of adults so this wasnt really the star of our holiday. Its ok for kids though. Fire show was was probably the fantastic! Animal show aimed at young kids as they have animals like owls etc. Theres also a very large crowd and queue to the animal show so you have to be quick to grab a seat. Tram ride was average, some animals were too far to see or capture on camera."
We recently visited the Night Safari . If you imagine Safari to be like Nepal or South Africa then just stop dreaming . It's a zoo Maintained nicely for the inside tour in Tram to watch the animals having their food . The food timings are Maintained such that all the animals can be visible . The quantity of the animals is not huge . Some countable in small numbers each breed .We had an iternary of Night Safari after checking out from the Universal Studio .I would suggest '' This is not at all Must Visit Place'' Compared to Thailand Zoo this place needs lots of improvement .You can visit if you have spare time in the evening . Otherwise no need to leave from the Universal Studio early in the evening .Travel agents have convenient pickup and drop accordingly so they would set this iternary but it's ok if not visited .The light show in the beginning and the night life animals show in the last was nice to watch . Full marks to them .One good thing ... they allow outside food with you .Tram ride has all the time waiting of 30-40 minutes so keep patience . No need to hurry . All the times mostly same waiting is there .Hope it's helpful .Thanks
"Nothing great about it. It's over hyped. It has been marketed well. Animal show was decent and the presenter was good. If knew before, would have given it a pass."
"Our group of 7 attended the night safari. With plenty of food options available we all had Dinner before our 8.15pm entry. The fire show just before entry was very good and entertaining. After finally entering the zoo we decided to walk around the zoo for a while before jumping on the bus tour as the wait was 45minutes long!! We headed back to the bus after a while when the line was still 35mins long. As the wait was so long we missed a couple of shows. The bus tour was really very good and the highlight was passing the wolf enclosure to have them howling to our hearts content!! After the bus tour we finished up with the night encounter show which was o.k. I'm only giving the night safari 3 stars because there were too many people which meant waiting times were too long and therefore not possible to attend everything on offer. I must disclose that we went during Singapore School Holidays, but a cutoff should still be applied in my opinion."
There are two parts to this activity - a ride that takes you round enclosures and then the opportunity to walk on paths taking you past other animals. If you can it's worth getting priority boarding for the tram ride as it lets you skip the queues which can be very long. The tram does not stop so you don't have the opportunity to stop and observe those animals and the continual movement makes any photography in dark conditions impractical. Having said that there is a fair chance of seeing some great animals like tapir fairly close up. Just ditch the camera for this part. More interesting are the paths where you can take your time and watch the animals. The high point for me was going into a large enclosure and seeing fruit bats just inches away - with no glass or barrier - eating and active. If you want to observe the animals at leisure the paths are less crowded and much more interesting than the 'safari' ride.
A thrilling experience for kids and young kids.Very well organised night ride.But the ques can be long so the earlier the better.The animal shows at the end of the ride was awesome.Worth the visit
I was originally visiting with a friend but plans changed so I ventured alone.Being a solo visitor I was directed to take the walk and not access the vehicle that drives around the zoo. This means there is an area that's not accessible.Although the walk was pleasant and not so crowded. Many of the viewing areas were too dark to see the animals.I would recommend to families as lots of children there seemed to be loving it.
"I found the night Safari a little confusing.I had to ask for a map when I got my ticket and glad I did.When you enter you get out on a train for a tour around the gardens. I feel like the right side get most of the higher profile animals.When that is over, we arrived to hear the 8.30 night creature show was full, which meant I could not see the show, due to my departure time.There are two walks that they refer to but what you don't realise is you can walk behind those areas. I'm glad I found out (although a little late as I had wandered slowly in first area). Managed to see Tigers before having to rush back to the bus."
Night Safari was good but its too busy. Dont do it with a tour group as you dont get long enough to do any of the walks. It would have been great a few years ago but now there are just too many people and the queues are unbelievable. Theres not much seating unless you are in one of the restaurants. We did a combined tour of River and Night Safari but they dont tell you that you have a couple of hours to kill between safaris where there is nothing to do but sit in the heat. It was a very long day and we wouldnt do it again.
"Long queue although there are time slots and rather dark atmosphere, so good for the animals I guess but hard to experience the animals bit better. Chinese people are ridiculous, after 10 times saying not to use flashlight they still do the whole ride."
The trip around the zoo was great and we saw lots of lovely animals however the line up to get on the vehicles was like being at Disneyland. I thought pre-booking would help but no. Go to later sessions if you can.
"The trip was enjoyable. Better than our expectations.The queues were very long and my young kids were restless. The staffs handle the crowd well.The parking however is troublesome, non-friendly especially the payment part. The Zoo staffs expect that the visitors who parked are locals and have ready access to the card payment system.That really spoils the otherwise excellent Night Safari adventure for my family.Make the parking payment system more (foreign) visitor friendly. Thanks."
"The place is over crowded which did not make it easy to travel with kids. The night show is always full, you have to queue 30-45mins in advance before the show. Plus the humid weather.. it wasn't the best experience. The staff try to be accommodating . The queue for tram ride was at least 20mins, which is also not so fantastic . But when riding the tram ride , it was enjoyable to look at the animals at their natural habitat."
Night Safari is very nice. Lines are very very long even with appointment times. The driving tour is a bit strange as sometimes the driver stops at some places and drives through at others. Not very many shows or dining options available but over all quite nice.
"Was a a bit too dark, would be great if it was brighter a little bit more as some of the animal was hard to see. But overall it was great, everyone need to take the tram ride to see more animal =)"
Visited one Saturday night. Went by taxi which cost S$23. We were a bit shocked by the number of people. There was a huge queue waiting to get on to the night trams. Imagine the airport and then quadruple that.However once we finally got our ride there was a pre recorded audio as we travelled around. It was interesting to see the animals unperturbed being on view in the dim light. We did enjoy this aspect of the visit.You are also able to walk around some areas. There are lots of food options when hungry.Plenty of taxis available when you exit.
"My rating is average due to earlier I was visited Disneyland Animal Kingdom at Florida USA and Safari World at Thailand. Comparing to both Night safari is little diappointed, but If you not visit Disney or Safari Thailand than its ok."
"This attraction has become a conveyor belt, churning hundreds of people through every night on trucks that don't even stop at each enclosure to allow you a good look. You'd be better off walking the trails rather than waiting in the obscenely long queues for the trucks. The only positive part of the experience was the show which was informative and entertaining. If you've been to other zoos around the world eg Taronga, Western Plains etc I wouldn't bother, especially considering the distance from the city and the cost."
"If you're looking for a thrilling adventure, then you should visit this place. The Night Safari is the world's first nocturnal zoo and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Singapore. It is divided into seven geographical zones, which can be explored either on foot via four walking trails, or by tram.THE GOOD PART:Up close and personal with the wild animals like lions, we actually saw giraffes, monkeys, zebras, and tigers almost a 100 meters away from our tram. But we are not allowed to touch or be near them even if the other animals come near us.THE BAD PART:Before we rode the tram we were told not to do flash photography or make inappropriate noise. The wild animals might be disturbed if they hear us if we make some noise, and prowl unto us. I was so scared and nervous the whole time during the ride, because the other guests inside the tram doesn't follow what the instructor told us to do.They were talking so loud and calling the animals by whistle.It was a fright night for me, an unforgettable experience Indeed!"
"Great and well-maintained site, fun tram with a nice proximity with the animals, but still you do not see the animals that much in the evening, some are sleeping or hidden in the dark. The major negative point is that you're paying for waiting in lines. It took almost one hour to get in the tramway. And even when it's finished, you still need to wait in lines to take a taxi or bus, about 30min of waiting.Also the taxi to get there doesn't cost 15-20$, as I heard and read everywhere. It cost us 30$ to get there and 45$ to get back (same place). It is disappointing that public transportation is not very well adapted to get there."
"To be frank,I was confused about what they are going to show when they are talking about a night safari (in the midst of a busy crowded city).To each his/her own,some people may like the place as well,but just sitting in an open bus and looking at those highly trained animals who are standing there,just for visitors to have a look at them ,was not a very pleasing sight for me but again,it's different for different people.Also,the first show starts at 7 pm,so reach their an hour early if you don't want to end up in a long queue.There is one more show,where they show the animals running n jumping on the stage, didn't find that entertaining at all."
"After seeing the show, riding the tram and walking around, there was little food available and very unfriendly and unhelpful bus transit staff.Great animal experience, the passion is awesome, lacking in customer service."
"The guides at the gate and along the tram are kind. However, the warm and humid weather make us sweat quite a bit. Maybe install more cooler fan along the trek."
Park layout is fine but not many animals were out. We didn't ride the tram and after a few hours my companion was tired. Crowds were not to bad and no wait time to get in.
It was mostly too dark and it was impossible to see some of the animals. Most of them were probably in hiding or asleep.But overall was an okay experience.
"We went to Night Safari after 12 years and were surprised to see that nothing has changed. Singapore as a country keeps changing, keep adding new excitements and fun activities BUT nothing new in night safari.There are other better things to do in Singapore at night rather than visiting night safari.Avoidable place."
"It was better than going to a zoo. The animals are somewhat free ranging, but somehow they are on display as the trams drive by. If you don't mind the Disney -like line ups for the trams and crowds, you will enjoy the experience. As we tend to shy away from the crowds, we preferred using the hiking trails, although you couldn't see everything."
"Food was expensive there although ambience was nice. The night safari itself was too crowded and noisy. The exhibits were crowded, difficult to see the animals. The tourists visiting talked loudly all the way through every exhibit. It was not a pleasant experience."
"The trams need a major overhaul, wonder how the animals sleep with so much noise around them. Worth visiting though and don't miss the show."
"I visited the Night Safari with my family in December 2018. Whilst it is a very cool concept, we were dubious about the authencity of it. As mentioned by other visitors, some of the animals do not appear to be real. Still, as aforementioned, it was a cool concept especially for the younger children."
"We had already experienced the Zoo, bird park and Amazon river safari before we came for the Night safari. Our experience was that the place was over crowded, with long queues to get in and than there were lots of tourists all around and the worst part was the mosquitoes biting while watching the shows. The tram ride was decent and it gave us glimpse of some of the rare nocturnal creatures.We saw the tribal dance performances, blowpipe demonstrations and fire eating displays. They were quite good. The best one was Creatures of the Night Show where there was a performance presented by the animals in the Night Safari.There are a few food outlets in the Night Safari like Ulu Ulu Safari Restaurant, Casa Italia, Bongo Burgers, etc. One can also dine in the ""Evening in the Wild"" at Night Safari's only Tepee tent. The food was strictly okay, nothing great to write about for the price we paid.I would say if you are pressed for time, it can be avoided to visit the Night Safari."
Difficult to actually see the animals. Photos are near impossible. And ridiculously long lines to wait for the teams. The idea is very cool though!
"This is good way how to finsh zoo day after visiting main zoo and river safari, but not worth to pay extra or visit only alone. This was the most haotic park and least organized - people must wait around one hour before opening and when thay open then they start fire performance which you can not see but must stand ir another queue while they deside to allow people get in arena where some kind of show later is performed (weak). After show you get a ride along park - oportunity to see animals, but if you spent already whole day in zoo then this will not impress. No flash so pictures will not be good as during day."
Large crowds all shuffling around and queuing to get onto the trams that go round for 45 mins. Animals are obviously fed and therefore have no need to go hunting for food.
"I was rather disappointed with this visit, given the glossy advertising. The information regarding how the train system worked was not clear until we got there. We ended up doing the walk around the zoo first, but had to get all the way back to the start to get the tram/train, whereas we'd have preferred to have had a rest and been able to get on part way. I was also concerned about the limited space that the animals had - to ensure they would be ""in the spot light"" for tourists."
"I preface this by saying I have been to some truly impressive wildlife parks and shows so perhaps I've been spoiled. But, my overall impression of the Night Safari is....meh!The park itself is out of Singapore proper, but a Grabcar was only $18 to get there from downtown and a taxi back was about $25. $48 for park entrance seemed high. The park reminded me a little of a Disney park - very crowded, bad overpriced food and a bit hokey. It just seemed more like an amusement park than a wildlife or nature park. Included with admission was the Creatures of the Night Show. Lame. A good portion of the audience left half way through. I think there were 5 creatures that they managed to stretch out for what seemed like an hour. Simply overplayed, not particularly informative. The 'audience interaction' was painful. Also included was a tram ride through the park. Again, my beef is that many of the animals are the same as you would see during the daytime. The problem is that , obviously it is dark, and many were out of site despite the also-painful canned narration that would describe them whether they were there or not. Most of the enclosures were lighted, so if you could see them, it was the same as viewing them in the daytime just a bit harder to make out. They were not active. You can also walk through the park which at least gives you adequate time at each enclosure, but again, nothing I would say that was extraordinary or noteworthy. At least there were not a lot of biting bugs. If you've never been to a zoo, or had little experience with nature parks, maybe this would be interesting for you. If you frequent such places, don't bother adding this to your list."
We were so looking forward to the safari having had great feedback from friends who had done it. Unfortunately we left a little disappointed. We had taken time to have camera set up to take photos (without flash) but tram moved far too quickly to capture a lot of the animals...we also had no help when tram ride finished to guide us to the walking areas on the site..instead we were just left at food court area and exit.Day trip to the zoo would have been better ....
The night safari tram does take you past a number of habitats but the animals for several are not where they can be seen and others may be difficult to see well in the low light. Not sure this is worth the cost and trip from the central city.
"Kind of boring compared to day tour in zoo. Cant really see much in the night. Therefore, not worth the money."
"Not as spectacular as I've heard. The ride was fast and bumpy. Seemed like the driver just wanted to finish the trip fast. There were very few animals visible, and most of the ones that were visible were different species of deer."
expected more - did not know before that there are two parks - one for the night safari is different...
"I can appreciate that some animals are more active at night and would thus be better observed at night, but the problems are 1) A human cannot see that well at night and coupled with the zoo's (correct) use of less intense lights, even less is visible; 2) Photos don't turn out that well; 3) There are more mosquitoes than during the day; 4) It is more humid at night(?); 5) It is relatively more inconvenient to get there in the evenings; and 6) You can fall asleep due to the lateness of the activity. I would advise visitors to just go to the Singapore Zoo and skip the Night Safari, or skip all of those shows and secure the earliest trams to be able to see the animals before it is truly dark. I would advise the zoo to concentrate on animals that are only active at night (hence, not elephants), including marine life, thus making this zoo truly unique and worthwhile for visitors. I'm not sure if that would be financially successful though!"
"We found that there could have been more flexibility of the safari entrance. There is a counter set up near the entrance, however we can't buy our tickets there. We were told that we need to walk all the way back to the zoo entrance to collect our online booking tickets from a foreign website. I hope more flexibility could be given so that we will not waste time"
"Took the boys who were really looking forward to it. We started with the live show, which was poor in my mind and the boys. Most seats had restricted vision and it was just not good.We then went on to the train ride, which was the best bit. It lasted around 40min (so did the queue for it, however it did move very quickly, they are soooo efficient!) we then embarked on the walk...which was OK but the boys wanted to see the lion fern and tiger feed and we really struggled to follow the signs as they weren't very well sign posted and not many rangers on site to ask for directions :( so we ended up missing both so boys were disappointed.We didn't try the food there because we were rushing to get to the transport back to city as it is about an hour away.Final note? We enjoyed it but will not repeat a visit.Sorry - no pictures"
"I visited the Night Safari in January 2019 after it was recommended to me. While it was a good visit, I found for the price paid it was slightly lacking and rushed in the time available between my Safari booking and when the last bus left to connect with the SMRT to the city, more frequent shuttles would be welcomed."
"The Night Safari tour overall was a bit of a bust for me. With all the hyped about this being one of the top zoos in the world I was set for a world class experience. The concept is brilliant, the atmosphere at night is amazing but getting to see the animals,, i.e. the reason one goes to a zoo, was pretty weak.The tram ride was horrible. You get schooled over and over about the importance of not using flash photography, both for the animals and fellow visitors' experience, and to not make any noises that might startle the animals. We get on the tram and get blinded right away as the staff are going around taking flash photos of you sitting there so they can get more money out of your pocket. Then the tram we were on squealed like a banshee every time our non-attentive driver hit the brakes. You could not hear yourself think as the noise of the brakes was so loud. Additionally, if our driver had of spent 25% as much time focusing on his job of driving instead of flirting with the female staff member he would have been more effective at slowing down so we could actually see a few of the animals that were out. Glad I did it but v pressed to say I would go again, this coming from a true zoo aficionado."
"It was an OK experience but expensive for what it was. The cost of tours run out of the city centre were very high so we took a cab and arrived at about 20.45 with a $30 cab ride. There was poor sinage for tickets and we were directed back and forth for 30 minutes until we found somewhere to buy tickets..We were told to run as the last ""show"" was 21.30. If you don't like seeing animals perform for human pleasure then don't go to this.We didn't have to queue for the tram and saw quite a few animals that were clearly very tame and not phased by us going very closeWe decided to get a drink before getting a bus back but by 23.15 everything was shut (the attraction is advertised as begin open to midnight) A bit disappointed we went to get a bus only to be told last transport expect taxis leave around 23.00. So a pricey cab home.The other issue was that when buying our entry tickets we were asked if we had flown with Singapore Airlines. When i said yes I was asked for our boarding cards. I explained that I tend to chick these away and not just keep them in my pockets. R+That error cost me $20 and it would have been nice to know in advance"
"Being rated as a must-see attraction in Singapore, we were looking forward to a great venue. Probably our expectations were too high, particularly fueled by the price. At the end we had some fun, but it wasn't great.On the day we visited, there were definitely too many people (entry at 8:15 pm). After the long queue the show was hard to follow from a corner seat. Once in the main attraction, the safari train, the visibility of the animals was limited. Later we were tired, and it was time to return to the city."
"If you have not been to Night Safari, it is good to experience it. But I personally would not go there for second times. I went there with my parents and my two kids, 4 and 8 years. The queue was super long. We booked the ticket online. We have to queue for around an hour. The safari itself was less than an hour. There are no food vendor in the queue, only drinks. Our kids were hungry. They were excited when they can see the animals. But they felt that it was too short. They preferred to go to the zoo in the day time so that they can see the animals longer. We had a dinner afterward. As usual, it is overpriced."
"Overall we enjoyed it, 3 adults, 6&3 yr olds. The tram is a must ,takes about 40 minutes and you go all over the zoo. There are lots of animals you don't get to see but that's the nature of zoos."
"Let's be honest : It's overpriced.I went to Night Safari with my family.Despite the good reviews that can be found on the internet, I think that that experience was a waste of money. On the tram rides, there was no social distancing. Everyone was at most 0.5m away from each other. Hand-sanitiser Dispensers are placed at the exits, and none were placed at the entrance. There were no warning signs on the wet floor and I did see someone slip.Overall, this trip was not worth it."
"It's bewildering how night safari is now packing people in the trams, unlike previously where they enforce alternate seatings. Doesn't make sense when at queues they try to make people stand within a meter from each other, and then throw all safe distancing out of the window on the trams. Worse when other passengers take their masks off, presumably to 'snack' or 'drink water'."
"This is a great example of something that is well overrated.You can't see 85% of the animals (on account of it being night) and the ones you can see only fall into a handful of categories - owls, deers, more deers, and the rest (the rest are animals you can see during the day at the zoo and in that case you can actually see them as it's day time and there is light).They don't take reservations for the live show, so you have to plan to spend 1 hour of your limited time in a queue - but you don't know exactly when to start queuing. Not ideal.Overall this is a thumbs down - stick to the fantastic and far more bang-for-buck zoo next door."
"It was strange. They have enclosures for each animals with spotlights in one area, probably 10% of the enclosure is lit up. All the 'Big 5' were bang in middle of the lit up area, so that made us very suspicious of this. What are the chances of the big attractions all being in a small area of the enclosure bang on selling time. The staff were ok but it didn't last as long as we thought either. We wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend it."
"The same shows as many years ago. Only the garbage sorting otter is a different animal now. Otherwise no further development. On our first visit, you could still feed the animals on the tour at stopovers. The staff that was supposed to prepare a Singapore Sling three times in addition to the fire show was just annoyed. Furthermore, one has the impression at the zoo, river safari and night safari that in order to save money the animal groups were only distributed in 3 attractions and thus the animal groups only got smaller. Exceptions are the pandas (were not distributed) and the polar bear that died."
"Expensive Tourist Trap! Not worth while!Can't hardly see anything, just a quick drive through, Speakers not working properly. Not at all what's advertised!Had high expectations from Singapore Zoo."
"Maybe great for families with small children but not for adults. Took the tram and if you were in the first to cars you might get a chance to take pictures (no flash!) but if you were in the back cars, could see when they stopped and drove by quickly so we didn't get to see very well & didn't get any pictures.Animal show is definitely for kids, cheesy but they will enjoy it. It was only about 15-20 minutes long.Not worth the money in my opinion."
"After dealing with various situations in Singapore where people were so honest about correcting their mistakes, it came as a shock to feel so cheated by the ridiculous Night Safari Singapore.If you really must go, then add it on to an afternoon trip to the zoo. But it would be a waste of money to do the Night Safari by itself. It's going to take you around half an hour to get there by taxi, and the taxi will cost around SGD 25, and then back again to your hotel.Hundreds, if not thousands of people arrive for the 7.15 ... and then again for the 8.15 entrance, and so on. Fortunately the queues move fast, and the staff get you on the trams quickly.You would think as dusk fell you would get a reasonable view of the animals. But you don't. Most the the animals you will see will be various deer and hogs. Let's be honest, what people really want to see is lions, tigers and magnificent beasts. Does anyone care about seeing hogs in the dark ?Many of the animals have dark fur .. so what you might get to see is some white or pink in their ears, and that's about it. Other impressive animals like the elephants, you can see them a whole lot better in daylight. So there's no point looking at them at night.We were also told the tram ride was around 45 minutes. It was over in 30 minutes.They save the best for last. A tiger, properly lit, in a small enclosure so it paces back and forth behind glass. Not entirely sure that's one happy tiger. And that's it, that is your highlight right at the end, the last 5 to 8 seconds.Also, irritatingly there's a horrible recorded American cheesy narration. They constantly ask people to be quiet to not scare the animals, but the Chinese and Indians don't listen or understand and jabber the whole trip, so ruin any atmosphere. Would have loved to have fed some of them to the lions.I also have my doubts about some of the animals in the main zoo. The beautiful leopards and cheetahs constantly pace back and forth in a very small space. It would send a human mad, so heaven knows what it does to an animal."
"Our last night in Singapore and we decided on this 'must-do' experience. Overall, I wish we hadn't bothered. It was a hassle to get there, way way way too over-crowded, the show was a damp squib, and mainly you could vaguely make out animals in the dark from a moving tram that would have been much easier to see during the day. Probably the best part was walking the trails as at least there most of the throngs were distracted at the concession stands, so it was relatively peaceful."
"There's one thing that's important to understand: the night safari is a ""tram ride"" through the zoo... at night. Not really a safari. Although we did ride pretty near one or two animals, we saw most of them from the same distance as you'd see them if you just visited the zoo during the day. The fact that it's a ""night"" safari means you don't see the animals so well, as it is dark. Getting there is a bit of a hassle as it's not near a metro station, so you need a bus, and there were MASSES of people. We spent for more time getting there and queuing up than looking at the animals. Visiting the zoo during the day would have been a better experience, but in hindsight we should have skipped it altogether."
"It's my 2nd trip to Night safari. I did not enjoy much as the 1st trip which was 8 years back. Back then I felt,they had more rare animals to show compared to this year. Maybe they have any schedule that I am not aware off,or it's just me getting older. Lol. But I thoroughly enjoyed the show featuring animals,not sure bout the name of the show though. That's the best part of the trip. Do not miss the show."
"With so many great reviews we followed the masses of people in Dec 2019 to see animals at night. There was about 20mins wait in line to buy tickets. There was about 40mins wait in line to get into the night safari. There was then another 35min wait in a zig zag line to get a tram ride to see some animals in their enclosures. We would have liked to go around again but weren't willing to join the line again. For over $200+ for a family of 5, I don't think it was worth it. They let too many people in the zoo even though there are set entrance times. There are still people there from the earlier entrance time.Great place to see some animals and lots of people queuing."
"As a part of the Park Hopper package we went off to see the Night Safari at the Zoo complex. Our entry time was 7.15pm and we arrived, by tax at around 6.30 and joined the queue. Whilst there appeared to be many taking part on the night it was only on a couple of occasions that we felt pushed out of the way.We were somewhat disappointed with the Night Safari for a number of reasons. The tram trip to see the ""nocturnal"" animals was average at best. The recorded commentary didn't always reflect what we were supposed to be seeing and the animals we did see, with the occasional exception, were not interesting. We did the tram trip twice, once at the beginning and once much later in the evening, but there was no difference in the experience.The Creatures of the night show was, pathetic. According to the blurb this was ""one of the world's finest animal shows"". In fact it was 15 mins of mainly talk and the occasional animal walked through the stage. That was it. The night walking trails were not bad but just because an animal is nocturnal doesn't mean it is sitting there waiting for you to come by. The food. though a tad expensive, was good and the staff were exceptional. They were always smiling and interacted with everyone answering all the usual questions.To sum up IMO the Night Safari is not worth the time, effort or cost to attend."
"I thought we would see a lot of nocturnal animals, but it was mostly a zoo in the dark.Three nature walks, but we couldn't just do one. We had no choice, as once on one of the walks, the only way to leave was to complete all 3."
"We booked pickup, dinner, safari and creatures of the night show through Tour East.The pickup and drop off went smoothly, and the show was low-key fun.The buffet dinner provided quite adequate choices, but the food wasn't hot or specially tasty.The safari should have been the high point. but was disappointing. It's short, and the animals are barely visible in the low light. Not all animals were nocturnal, eg lions.The walks sounded good, but the way our visit was structured, we only had time to walk for five minutes.Advice? Don't take a package, buy food from the snack bars, skip the safari, do a couple of the walks, and go to the creatures of the night show."
We visited Night Safari on 21st Sep. It was long queue for 7:15 PM Safari and after waiting for around 30 minutes we get into Night Safari. We feel same all animals of the Zoo which you just seeing in night under night light. It was too quick and short and not worth to pay much.
"We booked 7.15 pm tickets combined with the day zoo.We were pretty tired having walked around for 5 hours. We were not on a mod for further walking around.When I booked tickets I was happy to see that admissions were limited in each season. But it was chaotically busy, with must have been more than 500 visitors from India in the same session. Clearly there were no limitations on numbers, and we waited in queue for more than an hour for a 20 min tram ride. Some groups were broken up and make to fill in rows of 4 on the trams. What animals we did see were good but not better than the day zoo. Worth visiting but suggest later sessions - it's seemed to get quieter as we were leaving."
Great concept but it's so dark you can't see the animals that well and most were sleeping which is good for the animals. Ok to attend if you purchased the 4 park pass but I wouldn't recommend if you only purchased a ticket for this park.
"I booked on a tour to get skip the line tickets for the tram as i had read many reviews that standing in the line if doing it yourself can be along time. The tour was well organised but was extremely rushed. the tram ride was nice and relaxing but not many animals to see and of course poor lighting as this is a night zoo. After the tram you can see the shows, one is fire dancing and an animal show which is about conservation more than a show about the animals. To walk around the zoo at night, tracks can be misleading and paths uneven in poor light. I personally would skip this attraction."
Because our daughter is in a wheelchair we were advised to get a guide and at Â£150 each for the night safari it was not worth the money. The sound track for the guided trip through the zoo was out of sync so we were told about the animals once we had passed them. When you are looking at a Lion and being told about an elephant it is a bit annoying. Our cart broke down which was a major thing for the staff and no one really knowing what was going on. The fire show was good and the animal show ok.
"If you like us, just, visit the nightzoo without making an reservation for what time you may enter the zoo, you can wait more than and and a half hours before entering. I never had the feeling I'm in a zoo, more I'm at Disney or some other parc. Everywhere ques. Everywhere fastfood and everywhere you were spoken too like you are a kid in Disney. TERRIBLE. About ten years before we visited the Zoo and then it was great. Now it was one big dissapointing."
"Expect to queue if you make the trip here. We arrived early for the first timed admission at 7.15 but didn't get on the tram until an hour later! The experience was a bit different fro. A daytime visit to the zoo, the animals all appeared on queue and I couldn't help but think that they were somehow being kept in place! At the end of the tram ride there was a show but the next show was fully booked so we would have had to wait for another hour so didn't bother. It's a long trip out from the centre by MRT and then Bus."
"(no subject)TTrevorto me4 minutes agoDetailsLet me start by saying I love animals and enjoyed a day at the Singapore Zoo - not so the Night Safari.Like a lot of good ideas, this one appears to have been hijacked by greed for inordinate profit.Was it a peaceful, engaging, educational experience? NO Was it more like a crowded shopping mall? YES. Was it worth the money? NOHaving read reviews about long queues, we arrived at 6:30 for 7:15 time slot (bought on line). As you enter the park, the music blaring and shops give you the idea you are entering a ""Gold Coast"" style theme park, not a place to quietly encounter animals. By chance we were ushered to a new queue so were able to get on the first tram at 7:05 but I noted lots of people waited heaps longer. The tram ride was ineffective - instead of the driver having the ability to stop and spend time where the animals are visible, he is forced to keep going to fit in with the tacky pre-recorded commentary- why? Because just behind is another packed tram'¦..and another one'¦..(Note the tram commentary is not live as stated on the official website)I had hoped walking the trails might be moe enjoyable, but alas'¦.many of the enclosures are very small and lots of the animals appear bored or distressed. The most distressing species however was the humans - the park seems to be packed with people racing around (mostly with screaming kids) noisily calling to each other when they spot an animal, taking photos with their phones (I wonder how many of them turned out in the dark) and then racing off after a few seconds. I found myself telling a few people to be quiet and turn off their camera flashes, because no one else was. In fact some of the tour guides were the worst offenders. In the end I gave up. By the time we had fought the crowds back to the Creatures of the Night section it was full, so I can't comment on that.As I left, I read a notice that the park welcomes 1.3 million visitors a year, but I am not sure that is an achievement to boast about. The only way I can see this place improving is if visitor numbers are restricted and staff are visible and willing to regulate people's behaviour. In the mean time don't waste your money. Spend it at the mall instead - at least you will come home with something."
Really don't understand the amazing reviews. It's a zoo that you take a tram ride around at night. Horrendous queues to board the tram even with a booked slot. Kids were boiling and restless while we waited an hour after our 8.15pm booking just to board the tram. Ride took about 45 minutes so less time than the actual queue!! Yes you see some lovely animals but the tram keeps moving so you've gotta make the most of that 10 seconds you get to see it! Some enclosures are either empty or the animals are cleverly disguised as trees! I'm sure it's fun if you've never visited a zoo before!!
Had high expectations as had heard great things about night safari. Definitely would recommend booking a tour with priority boarding for tram as queue looked horrendous. The tram does not stop in front of animal enclosures so very hard to get photos. We were lucky enough to have front seat of tram so guide was whispering explanations to us. All in all think children would enjoy this but we were all very underwhelmed for price we paid.
This is a new must-go site for the tourists because of the wild architecture and the splendid views of the entire city and the region. Some fancy places to eat on the side.
"The view from up here in magnificent. You can see the Garden by the Bay, and whole Singapore. You can also grab a bite at the restaurant on the deck. But you do have to make a reservation fo it. The infinity pool is not accessible to visitors if you are not a hotel guests."
The view from the Observation Deck gave us a view of Singapore skyline from the PSA Container port to the Eastern anchorage.
The city lighting up on dusk. It looked like a glittering jewel. The view of the singapore flyer and the magnificent gardens by the Bay was breathtaking
"Make sure you reach there by 6:45 pm to see Singapore in day light and then sun set, and gradually you can see lights illuminating ..."
"My partner and I have been living here in Singapore for almost 3 years now, and this was the first time we went up there and it was amazing! The view from that deck during daytime was simply stunning - Singapore looked like a surreal garden during the day! From there you could take in the Malacca Straits with all the ships lined up like an armada about to go into battle; the Supertree Grove towering over the gardens underneath; the Conservatory Complex of the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest along the edge of the Marina Reservoir; the Singapore Skyline with its skyscrapers. And at night, the city is lit up and also has it's different kind of beauty. Dining at the Ce La Vi or the Skybar at night is a must-try! Singapore's beauty, day or night, is best viewed here."
Great city view. The photos can't describe how beautiful the city night view. Must go and experience it!
It can get very hot upstairs so dont forget your umbrellas!You can see bay and ocean side frim there !cheers!
"Incredible structure, fantastic views. Didn't realise that the top of the building provided a nightclub, bar & swimming pool! 3 towers with speedy lifts will soon take you to the most incredible view. A must see!"
You can see singapore skyline clearly from here. The deck itself is quite big so you will have enough space to capture your moment
Best spot to catch a glimpse of Singapore Cityscape. A nice spot to bring my family here once in a while.
Steps apart may make you feel like taking a photo you would like to keep. The CURVE of the poolside when viewed from one end will mesmerize you.Worth the time visiting there. EXCELLENT place no one should miss.
We visited Marina Bay Sands Skypark deck and we could glance the city from a great altitude. This place was once the tallest place to visit. This place is worth a visit.
"This is one of the coolest place to have the best scenic and panoramic outlook of the entire Singapore's crazy skyline, bustling with the amazing green architecture, green parks as well as the organized infrastructure. It is very relaxing. I visited this during the daytime and it was not bust at all. It can get very busy in the evening.If you are in Singapore this is a must visit, definitely worth paying."
We went on a clear low wind day. The main deck has a clear view or the harbor and down town. Bring binoculars. You can get cocktails at the bar and maybe not have to pay for the elevator. watch the weather. We missed one day when it was rainy
"The experience as well as the views are stunning. We arrived late afternoon and stayed well into the evening, enjoying the view, the lights, the super trees, the harbor, and more."
Night time visit a must. The use of lights in Singapore is legendary so be sure to see the light shows at night.
You can take splendid pictures of Singapore. It is best to go at Sunset so you can see part of day and night.
"This is a must visit attraction. You get a wide stretching view of the sea on one side, dotted with moored Ships and yachts, and the main business district of SGP on the other side with an unending maze of skyscrapers. The Gardens by the bay, the Singapore eye and the rest of the city can be viewed, too. It's a beautiful site and should be visited in the evening when the whole city is lit up. The queues can be very long on holidays, but the whole experience is worth it.By the looks of it, the idea of sitting at the Bar over the Deck would be quite a fine thing to do :-)"
This was a great place to look over the entire city. The cost was understandable but overall it wasn't that bad. Easy to get up and down but bring sunscreen if you go during the day.
"Worth seeing simply for the amazing views. However, once you have walked around the deck a couple of times there is nothing more to see or do."
The observation deck is actually floor 56. Pay extra to go to floor 57 before you enter the lift in tower three. for the best experience.
Fantastic views of Singapore! It was quite enchanting to also watch the Gardens by the Bay light show from this deck. Also loved the souvenir photos of us that came with the paid tickets!
"This is a must visit place. The views from here, 200 metres up in the sky are breathtaking. Not for those with vertigo but magnificent for all others!"
You're so high! We got access to the skypark for free because we stayed at the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Amazing views from the top! We went at night and the city was lit up!
"a must to do in Singapore, there is a charge to go up but take your bording pass with you and you get a discount on the price. Well worth it for the views of the city."
"Marina sands bay sky park observation desk experience is awesome. i will tell you genuine experience,tickets you may buy from basement of the hotel or from Klook app., reach there around 5pm and enjoy sunset as well as night view it was so satisfying. here i will recommend if you had experienced already burj khalifa or any other high rise attractions then you can skip this. carry enough water with you bcz at that hight you will not get free water it will cost INR 400 rs. FOR 700 ml water bottle. disappointing for photography lovers is no tripods allow, camera allowed only no extra charge for camera. once you go up there then no tile limit for exit so enjoy fully and if you are hurry for next attractions then its your choice bcz down at garden by the bay there is night sound and light show."
"About 20 Singapore dollars to visit. Exceptional staff to guide you through and up to the top. Had to have temperature checks on arrival, but that's standard in most places now what with Coronavirus. Its up on 56th floor, the lift was fun! At the top we aimed to get there for sunset as then we got the views followed by the night scene with all the pretty lights. Two sides: city view and garden view (gardens by the bay view) you could see the gardens by the bay light show from up top which was amazing! Unfortunately there was some works being done so we couldnt get to the tip of the ""boat"". Luckily it was very empty ?Coronavirus caused it but we were grateful. We were then shown up to level 57 where we had a drink in the bar, but we had mixed messages as to this, someone said that was for an extra ticket holder so we dont know whether the lift guy got us confused with someone else. We had a nice (but pricey) cocktail up here and as its international womens day all women got a yummy shot! Go ladies!!"
"A good way to see the city of Singapore from 56 floors high,the views are spectacular and you can see all the main attractions in the city from this one place"
"Well worth a visit when in Singapore. The Sky Observation deck will also give you access to the cafe on top of the observation desk, with an outside terrace to enjoy a drink and a meal overlooking Singapore."
Worth coming up to this viewing platform - how they constructed it I will never know! Lift very quick and you get a good view all around and out into the marina and harbour. You can also see at one end over to the infinity hotel pool.
"Great view of Singapore's skyline, best time to come is either during sunset or at night, it's more cooling and the night view is better."
"If you're a modern architecture buff and enjoy views from elevated heights, then this wins on both counts. The Skypark is shaped like a long boat and sits atop - and straddles - three 56-storey towers of hotel accommodation. At ground level there's a casino and restaurants/bars etc. But the views from the Skypark viewing deck are spectacular and offer a great viewing point for the Gardens by the Bay night-time light show."
"WOW !!!!!Its amazing , to be given the opportunity to get so hight to have a panoramic view 270 degrees of the city simply fantastic , so many photo opportunities , so much to take in.A great tourist destination."
"It is a great view from the iconic building in Singapore and one of the more recognisable ones in the world. It is a reasonable price as these things go, and affords a great view. Some of the platform is closed for maintenance as of Feb 2020, but we were warned of this before buying our tickets, and the all round panorama is still visible.If you are a lover of heights, you will want to see this one, and I dont think it will disappoint."
"I am a bit of a view's from heights nerd so for me this opportunity was not to be missed,from the first time i saw this building on a night time journey in from the airport it was a must do for me and i was pleased to find out that there was a viewing platform.For me the fee of getting up here was more than worth it and the views all around are amazing,the skyline of Singapore and the views out across the city as well as the hundreds of container ships out in the bay are memories i will never forget."
Looking for somewhere to go for the best night views then this is the place to be. It wasnt overly costly and we managed to get some great views as well as pictures and my 4 year old son enjoyed it too. It was overcrowded and you had loads of space and time to take it all in. I would highly recommend visiting here.
Great experience and perfect view of Singapore's skyline. Definitely a must visit when coming to Singapore.
Went here recently with friends ; get a great view from the top ; and there's a little shop up there where you can buy a drink and something to eat ; unfortunately there's no seats to enjoy the view while having a drink unless you go to the restaurant and spend a lot more : we went just after breakfast so didn't want anything to eat ; only a cold drink
"We went back in February to see how the bay had developed. No better place to see, than the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, from the observation deck."
You take a fast lift to the 56th floor to take a panoramic view of the city. Breath taking views. Don't forget your camera and make sure it has a battery.!!
"The Observation deck was an amazing way to see the whole of Singapore and get a better idea of the small yet beautiful country. With the Marina Bay Gardens on one side and the business district and the old quarter on the other side, you literally see half of the country! Would 100% recommend paying the extra money to go to the top."
I recommend everyone to spend at least a night in this hotel. Staff is helpful and look after clients. They make the experience to go up an extra level and accommodate your request when is posible. Rooms are great and designed to enjoy
"Abslolutely amazing experience, level 57 also includes a bar (Cest le Vie) which you can access for S$23 but you get a voucher for S$23 to use against food or drink (you will need to top up a little but the view is fantastic)."
We sat up here and watched the sun go down and it was beautiful watching the busy city below us go by.
Visited the Skypark Obs Deck during the day and wasn't disappointed. Great views and got some excellent photos of the Singapore cityscape and Marina Bay. Also opted for the frozen Singapore Sling on the deck. Check it out - it's worth the trip. A night visit would be a bonus!
"okay so this place definitely the best if you want to see singapore at large, you can also just sit there and drink singapore sling while enjoying the view."
Awesome view from the sky park. Specially after dark. Beautiful view of the city line & Garden on the bay Super trees! Definitely worth it! The view is spectacular from the Skypark.
"Unfortunately as much as I love the Marina Bay Sands building as a piece of wonderful modern architecture, I am pleased we did not stay there on our recent trip to Singapore as even the Reception Area for the hotel was basically a public thoroughfare to gain access to the shopping plaza"
#NAME?
"57 floors up you at Marina Bay Sands Skypark visitors deck you (as you probably understand) can see far away in the distance! We went there in the afternoon and stayed until late evening. The view is indescribable, and as the sun set you see all lights in Singapore come to live! Even if you're like me afraid off heights it's definitely worth a visit."
"We didn't do the sky park observation deck instead we went to the se la vive bar,it's on the 57th floor so you get a fantastic view,the difference is you pay 23$ then at the bar you get the full 23$ back towards your drinks,we went daytime but I think the evening would be spectacular."
"After Singapore Flyer, this is the best place to view the city from the top at all angles - it is very impressive especially at night. This is located at the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. It costs about 26 Dollars per person and the lifts are quick to get to the top. At the top, there is a restaurant and a small kiosk serving snacks and drinks (hot and cold)"
"At the top you can see the city of Singapore, day or night. It is just wonderful city, that's why it is referred as the garden city. Come see at night where the city lights are gleaming."
Wonderful views of Singapore. Lift is very quick and no rush to go back down. Very windy on day we visited but 360 degree views of Singapore with Gardens of the Bay below.
The view from the top is spectacular and should definitely be a part of your Singapore itinerary. Unfortunately the infinity pool and the restaurants at the top of the hotel are out of your bounds unless you are staying at the hotel. Best time to visit is near sunset so you can have view of the Singaporean skyline in day and dark. Suggest you spend good 2-3 hours there since the views are mesmerising with the gardens by the bay on one side and the lighted Multi- storeyed buildings on the other.
"I spent the entire evening here watching the sunset, the bayfront show and the Gardens by the bay light show and all were worth the view! Can see the entire city and great photo opportunities!"
Lovely view of the bay and surrounding area. Worth the money to see things from the top of the hotel
We went to the SkyPark as part of a tour and were not disappointed. The night time view of the city was spectacular. Highly recommend you see it!
When visiting Singapore. do not miss staying at Marina Bay sands at least for one night. It is totally worth it!The infinity pool is dreamy! One would not want to get out go it. The food that we ordered was also delicious.The rooms are as clean as any luxury property. The room service is prompt too.The breakfast buffet has enough options for anyone and everyone!
"Worth visiting. Amazing views of Singapore. The entrance fee was reasonably priced. Though busy because of visitors in the city for Chinese New Year, it was well organised and we didn't need to queue for long. Would visit to see again and especially at night next time."
"There is a choice to make. For access to the observation deck you pay the $26 each or wave your SingaporeAir boarding passes and get 15% off each ticket. This entitles you to access to a large open deck on the 56th floor. Alternatively you can buy a pass at the ground floor for the ce la vi restaurant which entitles you to access the 57th floor restaurant and a wider, possibly more comfortable experience. This does not open till midday so we opted to go just for the observation deck. Despite some criticisms on this forum we found the view excellent, there were no queues when we arrived at 11 am and we had as much of a panorama as we wished for with views over the city, harbour, bay gardens and out to sea. Sure there were no seats or shade but there are toilets and access to drinks available to buy. You can see the infinity pool in the distance but not close up. We may have been lucky with the weather and the sparse numbers of visitors but we felt it was a well worthwhile experience."
The amazing place to visit. Great views from the top. Food is good too. Very nice place to take photos of nice memory of visit Singapore. One of the best man made view in the world.
"One must visit this attraction if you are in singapore and if you really want to enjoy the whole view of singapore. At 57 floor, you could even feel height and the lift is like a jet."
"This was a bucket list tick for me to go to the top and have a look, would so love to swim in the infinity pool but you have to be a house guest! But the view from the top is breathtaking, and a must do if you are in Singapore."
View of whole Singapore from floor no. 56 is very amazing and beautiful and nice place to visit for tourists .
"We had purchased our tickets online , but you can purchase them on the day anyway. Our photo opportunity was cut a little short by a heavy thunderstorm we were watching roll across the bay. Mind you it did make for some dramatic photos. Well worth a visit when you are in Singapore"
The Skypark is ideal for watching the sunset and seeing Singapore light up. Highly recommended as a top attraction!
As long as you don't suffer from vertigo this is must visit place. The views are incredible and you just don't want to leave. Beautifully designed and with such imagination. Great!
The marina bay sands sky Park is a huge 150m long infinity pool lined with deck chairs and looking out across the Singapore skyline.The sky Park is only accessible to guests of the hotel and offers views over the Singapore skyline and the gardens at the bay and the main shipping lane. I recommend watching the sunset with a drink up there.The pool gets busy fast with people posing and taking selfies it's great for people watching.There is also a kids pool as well if you have babies with you.
"We visited the Marina Bay Sands first in 2018 and stayed in Club level. Perfect room, perfect lounge, it is worth the extra price!"
Most stunning views of Singapore. Must see for everyone coming to this city. Provides a 360 degree view from 57th floor!!
"The city skyline came to life as the sun went down over Marina Bay. This is a great place to take amazing sunset photos and great silhouettes of the city.If you go to Singapore and don't go the Skypark, you are missing out on some spectacular views. This is a must visit place for all photographers"
"I cannot say enough about this experience, it was definitely a check the bucket event in my life. The pool was fantastic, the view was great and the service staff great. The food and drink were great, especially considering you were 57 floors high, poolside."
"A must do thing whilst in Singapore. You don't get access to to the pool or restaurants on a normal ticket, but restaurant access I think you can buy. The view from there are great and you can see throughout most of Singapore. Adults was priced at 26SD if you have a Singapore airline ticket you get a few dollars off."
This stunning building offers the most spectacular panoramic views of Singapore. Make it your 1st stop.
"We took the elevator to the bar, bought a drink each (yes - expensive) and took some great photos from the outdoor bar area. Top spot!"
"A must visit place for spectacular views of the city. It's really easy to purchase tickets and the queues aren't too bad, we had a 10 minute wait.Don't forget to take your camera guys."
I would highly recommend taking your camera with stand there so take some awesome photos.It can get crowded so perhaps check beforehand about the best times to go.Its not really a swimming place but a place to take some amazing photos from 100 different angles.The drinks bar is good too but $$$. Take your own food and drinks with you
"Short layover in singapore, we cannot miss Marina Bay. They have beaches as well near which is a to do for next time"
Went at 10 am on a Monday got a self service ticket very easy. No queue to go in lift and staff cheerful and helpfulIt was a clearish day so good views
"Make sure this is on your list of things to go to and see the views are amazing , we went at night but I'm sure it's amazing during the day also ."
"This is for those who like viewing the City from a very high place. Before going to Skypark, there is a mall with so many shops for shopaholics."
"Starting with the superfast liift the visit to the viewing platform was a thrilling experience. We could see all the lights,, harbour,, Marina Bayand the Singapore skyline, all enhanced by an icecream from the platform cafe."
Great view across the bay and a lot of the Singapore skyscrapers even when a little misty due to weatherEven better at night when lit upWe were lucky to be staying in the hotel so we were able to look around on several different occasions. Still a magnificent view whenever you look!
"The pool and the views from the sky park were the main reason for booking a stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Rather hazy during our stay in November, but still great views. Pool was quieter in the morning than in late afternoon/early evening but possible to get sun loungers and to enjoy a swim in the pool."
"Ironically the best swimming pool experience.Stunning views over the city from the pool both day and night and awesome views out to sea from behind the pool.We arrived on a Sunday morning for a one night stay, the pool was not overly busy and certainly not crowded. there were lounges available the pool was not crowded with people taking selfiesI noticed there was an adult section of the pool and a children's further down.The service was friendly"
"My wife and I visited the upper deck of the Marina Bay Sands hotel on New Year's Eve (2019), and we were blown away at the experience and the stunning panoramic views. It was enchanting, and we spent a couple of hours supping Prosecco, surveying the Singapore sights, and talking with like minded visitors. You pay for entry and in return you receive one complimentary drink, that is fair enough, as this deters those who would otherwise do a freebie visit just for the view. It's a must, when visiting Singapore!"
"I am a bit affraid of heights, but braved the skypark. Glad I did, views for days and so peaceful. The process if quick to get up and the free drink is even better. You can download the free photo on your return"
The Skypark is now one of the most recognisable features of any city worldwide. The views over the city are spectacular and in particular you get a sense of the scale of the Gardens on the Bay and the incredibly busy shipping lanes off the coast of Singapore. The restaurant/bar at the Skypark (Lavo) has excellent views and whilst a little expensive is part of the experience of visiting Skypark
"If you are guests at the hotel , it's free but otherwise too, view from the deck is impeccable.A Must"
"This iconic hotel and it's rooftop pool, restaurants, and view deck are a must see. The pool area is only open to current hotel guests so if you want to experience the pool you must stay at the hotel. There are restaurants on either end that you can to without being a guest. As with any high end hotel, food and drink pricing is high. The views of Singapore are incredible."
"The hotel is very large and busy, but once we found the correct elevator to go up to the observation floor all was good. You have to pay to go to the 56th floor and all it is is an open area to walk around and get a view of the city. We ended up going back down and then paid more to go back up on another elevator at different location to go to the 57th floor with a bar and had a drink. That floor is worth it if you want to eat, drink or sit down. The 56th has no place to sit and no shade."
"We stayed at the hotel , views are breathtaking , nice pool , very relaxing . You are on top of the world amazing experience.my kids enjoyed the pool and view ."
A little confusing on whether you can go to the very top as told different stories by different hotel reception staff - you can go to the very top where the pool and bar are but can only go into the bar if not a guest not the pool area - however the path leading into the bar has a great view of the pool and views of Singapore - you can go to the viewing floor below the top floor by paying an entrance fee
"When you are in Singapore this is a must. Views are spectacular, but a few shady spots would be really helpful. Senior discount available."
"This isn't for the faint-hearted, you are certainly up high! But the view over Singapore is well worth it. When we visited there was some renovations taking place so we couldn't access the whole area, a little disappointing but we still managed to get a great view. It doesn't take long to do, there isn't much up there once you get there. A little expensive but something you need to do atleast once in your life."
Purchased my ticket from Klook in order to avoid any queues. I went for sunset in order to see Singapore at both day and night. It was worth a visit - even with the haze covering singapore. Note - you can not sit down at the bar upstairs - this is only if you pay extra or are staying at the hotel.
"Great view over Singapore from here and nice to take pictures, wasnÂ´t crowded as well so it was worth my time"
"A friend and I visited recently, unfortunately most of it was closed off for renovations, we did get some nice photos from the small amount of decking available, but for the price it was a quick experience."
"Marina Bay Sands is the most iconic building in Singapore. It is basically a 5 star hotel and casino with a sky park and swimming pool on the roof. (Featured towards the end of the film ""Crazy Rich Asians"".) Sadly, you won't see any of this unless you are a guest at the hotel. However, the roof area has been segregated so that a small portion of it is available for tourists to ride up and admire the view. 57 floors up. A fantastic (but partially restricted) view over the city and the straits. Worth a look but very expensive for what it is. Less than an hour and you've seen it."
"I was staying at the MBS and when I went to take a stroll round the observation deck in the day most of it was closed due to renovation work. I happened to be at the infinity pool in the evening and noticed part of the deck was open so went to see the city view as my room had garden views.WOW, well worth a visit. I think there is a ticket cost if you are not staying at the hotel.There are plaques as you walk round to tell you what you are seeing as you look out and Ce La Ve have a little takeaway pizza place on the deck if you are feeling peckish or thirsty while admiring the view."
"Great views, although front section was closed off. Easily accessible, however no shade or seating. Needed in the heat."
This was a beautiful experience we had. Great to see the view of Singapore from the deck. Great customer service at the ticket counter. Great ambiance. We all loved it.
"It's a must see at night, such great views of the city.You can see gardens by the bay all beautiful lighted, ferris wheel and all of the best Singapore has to offer from a bird's eye. It's such a lovely spectacle and feast for the eyes.Tickets were about $23."
"Although a little on the expensive side this place really is worth visiting. The views from it are amazing! If you ASK there is another floor you can access (via the lift) When you get to the top you exit the lift and turn left. When you get outside everyone turns right. If you look LEFT there is a narrow passageway, that gives access to another area where there is a bar and seating. You also get a view of the infinity pool. Don't get too excited, you can only use the pool if you are staying in the hotel. (it's not obvious so not many find it. Turn RIGHT and you get to another bar area with seating and awesome views. Just sit down BEFORE you look at the bars price list. But because of where you are you simply must have a Singapore Sling to sip whilst soaking up the view. Once you have visited the bar you cannot reypturn to the observation deck, it's the ground floor only. The entrance fee includes five photographs and a video (download the next day) Clever system, they take your picture as you go in and you are then superimposed on five different photographs of the building.Andy"
As a non-resident of the hotel we had to pay to go up to the observation deck but it was worth it. Part of the deck was closed off when we visited for renovations but we still got a great view. The views stretched from the Gardens by the Bay to the many skyscrapers that fill this city skyline. Worth a look if you've a head for heights !
This definitely needs expanding to be able to take lunch or dinner without having to be a hotel gust. They are missing trick. Without that the short view is expensive
Wanted to get a view of the Singapore skyline at night so the sands skypark seemed the logical place to go.We didn't pre-book and paid $52 SGD (about Â£15 each) on arrivalThere is currently a renovation going on so the area you can cover is reduced.On one side you have the financial sector and the other is the gardens and Singapore flyer.Excellent view and plenty of great shots to get with your camera.I only had my phone and no cover so if you want to hold your phone outside the wires and don't want to lose your phone take one of those water proof cases which you can put round your neck.Or if your a camera enthusiast then you have something a bit more chunky and the strap.We didn't stay there long once we'd taken our photos. Other than the views there's not much up there. There are toilets and a small snack bar for refreshments
"Understandably the guests of the hotel get world's most iconic infinity pool, located on the OTHER half. None-the-less this is a must visit and the view unbeatable. Riding to the top in early covid-time, my remark in the ultra jam-packed elevator that if any one coughed we'd be all wondering our fates only made some giggle. All the rest were bravely holding their breaths."
"I'd already pre-planned this before our trip, and as a senior we did get a discount. Fair to say there were fabulous views across the City so well worth the $20 each."
Amazing view from the top of this amazing building .only gripe we had was we were never told when we paid tickets we also had to pay a ticket at26dollars to be allowed into outside bar to sit and have a drink .so we had to buy a drink from a vendor and just stand with plastic glasses to drink it as no seats are available.
Went to see the awesome views was great but some parts were closed due to repairs but otherwise was great
"The views up here are very nice, and change as you go through the 270 degrees of different directions the platform covers. A pity there is no opportunity to have a proper cup of coffee or tea. The adjacent terrace is strictly for hotel guests, and the outlet on the observation deck itself is very....basic."
"Was at the deck late evening. The well lit Singapore view was quite amazing. One can just chill on the deck and munch or drink on the restaurant there for hours. Breezy, quiet and calm vibe."
"If you want to grab a great view I would recommend not paying to do so from the Skypark Observation deck. Instead, go for a drink at the bar which is one floor higher, and also has great outdoor views. You don't pay to go to the bar but the drinks and food are not overly expensive."
"We bought our tickets from the Tourist Info intending to take the lift up, have a quiet G & T whilst we watched the sunset & the light display in the gardens. Didn't realise we needed a different ticket if we wanted to go to the bar which is on the 57th floor. No worries. Had a wander around (there's no seating on level 56), took some photos, watched the light display in the gardens (which is actually much better from inside the gardens as you can't hear the music from on high), saw the sunset, then went back down when we'd had enough. Nice way to spend some time & catch the breeze."
"The view of Singapore on top was spectacular. We went up late afternoon after a hard rain and waited until dark. You can see the difference in the surroundings during daylight and night time. The observation deck was full of tourists (some are quite drunk & loud) but okey. Cost to go up is $S32 and that includes professional photo that you can download for free. Line was a little long but fast moving. The port of Singapore looks amazing on top. The show at the Gardens by the Bay was a delight. The only negative thing I can say was, the Skypark where the beautiful garden and pool are only accessible to hotel guests."
They don't want you to stay long as there is no seating. There was plenty of space for seating and it wasn't busy when we visited. Well worth it for the view of Singapore and the port and shipping.
"Went to the top a total of 56 floors I think, reviews were great all over Singapore.It cost $26 to go up and theres a small bar to get a drink at the top, although no seats.No more than 30 minutes needed for this and no real queues to get up it.Go to tower C and down the stairs outside the tower"
Best viewing point for Singapore skylineand the Gardens by the Bay. Timed our visitto see both light show. While nice would bebetter if we were closer to the water n lightspectacular.
"Not cheap and you only have access to about one third of the rooftop but well worth it for the panoramic views over Singapore and Gardens by the Bay below. Obviously, if you can afford to stay at the hotel you get free access to the skypark and you get to use that iconic pool!"
"Not cheap to go in but well worth it for the views. You cannot use the pool though, only available for guests."
Place that gives you a glimpse of the City. Can be visited bith during day and early evening for different experience.
It's $20 for an adult to get up to the observation deck on top of the Marina Sands but there is a bar and hotel up there that when you want a drink you're told you need to go back down the ground level from floor 56 to get another ticket to come back up to the bar/restaurant.Do the sensible thing and get a ticket for $23 which allows you up to the bar level which is higher than the observation deck level so along with getting great views you also have the opportunity to sit down enjoy a drink and take it all in!
"Sky deck is on 56th floor, cost 26 Singapore dollars pp (@ Â£15 each)The building is amazing 'perched' 200m above sea level, 'sitting' upon the three towers of Marina Bay Sands complex.It is a giant observation deck with 360 panoramic views across Singapore, giving you a birds eye view of most of the attractions below especially the Gardens by the bay.There are toilets and refreshments available, but you cannot access the infinity pool area (hotel guests only)It could do with a few benches to sit on whilst admiring the views, no sitting on the decking is allowed ( though people were)Worth a visit....it's iconic."
"The observation deck was great. The views of the city are amazing. Go up just before dusk and take in the day light of the city and then night lights. It was Chinese New Years so it was very busy, but not an issue really."
"Decent charge to access, S$26pp but is a great experience and well worth doing and well organised with fast lifts, restaurant, toilets, wind protection and no time limit. Some great all round views of Singapore, choose a clear day!"
The Skypark was recommended to visitAnd I am glad we did the views of all of the city and the landmarks is quite breathtaking.The skypark is well worth a visit but pre book tickets to help jump the queues
"It has to be done, visit this iconic building, travel to the top and see Singapore from above.Like everything in the city, it's expensive, the ticket is just to the viewing platform and you can't sit down. If you get past those two facts you don't over expect and you won't be disappointed.It seems quite a slick operation and we didn't really queue to get up or down and were pleased that we did it."
This is a cool observation deck with great views of the city. Came here at sunset when the city lights were beginning to appear. Lovely panaromic views of the city and city skyline. We stayed to catch part of the light show below. Highly recommended experience.
"I wasn't sure whether I would have time to go up to the top, I'm glad I did as the views are amazing!Make sure you get a drinks voucher from Ce la vie then you get access to the top as well as a drink, more cost effective!"
This gives you almost complete view of Singapore. One side you can see Garden by the Bay and other side tall corporate buildings. Overall nice experience.
"Beautiful views, very expensive but buildings like this dont come cheap, its like a cattle market trying to get a seat."
Try the bar celavi on top. Expect many people and sky high prices. For me to much Vegas.There are much more charming rooftop bars in Singapore!
"The view from the Skypark is fantastic!You can see the whole Singapore from the top. The cost is 23SGD, about 15â¬. It is a must visit."
amazing view from the 56th floor of hotel marina bay sands. the day we went it was raining and chilly . huge gusty winds prevented us from going close to the glass parapet. the visuals are beyond words
"Entry is from the 3rd tower where tickets for S$22 will take you to the 57th floor (entry fee goes towards a drink at the top). Turn left and left again from the lift to the Ce La Vi bar for views of Singapore, the Marina and the Infinity Pool. If you go through the bar towards the toilets, you get another great view looking over the Singapore Gardens."
I went up to the bar at the sky park and what a view. The skies were a little cloudy hence not a clear vision. But I enjoyed a cocktail and relaxed during sunset. Lovely hotel but lots of people.Best to visit during early hours. There is a shopping mall at the hotel and many eateries as well.
"You honestly stay here for the Pool. The hotel room was really basic for how much it costs to stay here. Nothing special, very basic and clean but not worth the price tag. The food, shops, and the service are amazing. There's a lot to do at all times either shopping, eating, dancing etc but the pool is where its at. The view, the food and drink was just amazing. It could have been a little warmer, the water is freezing but it was worth it to stay for one night."
"So we went there as Singapore trip is not complete without it .. but trust me it can be..It was so crowded there was no space and as seen everywhere in Singapore there was no planning or crowd management. They were giving tickets to any number of people creating a fish market and as per review and research it's the case most of times.Would suggest to book a table at CAfe la ve, you don't have to take the entry ticket of 32 SGD and can actually eat/drink something for that money.Also such a waste of paper with printing everyone's pic and trying to sell it with no luck, obviously MBS will throw all the pics which were not sold. Again a very bad practice seen all over singapore.Really bad practice from a country/orgs preaching so much about environment at every step."
We went up and perched in a bar at the top the views across the bay and over the city is fantastic. It is easily accessible from the downstairs lobby at the side of the hotel. Well worth a couple of hours of your time.
"Best view on the city and certainly a landmark since the opening. But if you have it ticked, no need to return"
"We went up there to the restaurant, they charged us Sin 25, but there is a Sin 20 drink voucher that we can be in used. So that was okay. All of my Girlfriends just want to have a look the overview of Singapore, and the endless pool. As that day we in was raining, so nothing much going around. After a drink, we came down to Marina Bay Sand Shopping mall for food!!"
Great view from the top. Try to go during sunset or after sunset. You can see the beautiful skyline of Singapore including the stunning view of the Garden by the Bay. It is a bit expensive but one should go for the beautiful view it provides. Since i visited just before the new year it had very long queues and even to come down i had to wait 20 mins. The staff are very efficient and friendly. One must visit this place at least once.
The line is long but moves quickly. There is a small bar at the top with limited food options and expensive drinks. Only hotel guests are allowed to dine at the restaurant.
"Very good place to be seen plenty do do on way ,hop on bus stops close , we visited late afternoon, after cocktails at raffells"
We reluctantly did the trip up to the Skypark due to the expense - but as our youngest son (16) was very keen we relented. Although I still consider the expense ridiculously exorbitant it was a great experience. The views were amazing and we spent a good hour at the top.
"We visited the Sands Skypark during the day to avoid the crowds. At 11am there was no queue and we had plenty of space on the viewing deck. The views of the city, the bay and the gardens are incredible on a clear day. However, be aware of a couple of things that other reviews have mentioned - the pool area and gardens are for hotel guests only so you'll only be able to access a relatively small part of the roof and the restaurant is for guests only. There's a small stall that sells drinks and souvenirs. It's not the cheapest attraction in the city but it was a must see for us."
"We visited the Marina Bay Sands hotel whilst in Singapore, went straight up to the rooftop bar for a spectacular view and was not disappointed.The bar is open to non residents but is a little pricey, although this is to be expected, the infinity pool is only accessible to guests now, but the views from the bar are still great.Would recommend a visit at least once"
Fun to do and amazing views we did the admission with an icy Singapore sling which was good but no where to sit down whilst you drink and served in a plastic cup though still worth it for the views
This is a unique and impressive building with awesome views. Definitely worth the ride up to see the city from on high
Fantastic place with awesome view of Singapore from 54th floor. Humungous building. Upmarket shops but has a food court with great variety of food. Great to watch the light show at Garden s by the Bay from 54th floor.
It's a beautiful location to see view of beautiful Singapore. I just don't think it's a great value however. Probably no. I would invest in stay at hotel instead and see it for free from pool and not public area over priced.
"This is perhaps Singapore's most famous building and, not least, views! It feels like the entire hotel is created solely for this magical world of skylines, skyscrapers and eternal sky against the evening sun and stars ... Nothing to the height scared, though the railing and glass walls are reassuringly high. The view is reasonably similar no matter what part of the roof terrace you buy tickets to - the difference lies in whether you are staying as part of the hotel and can enjoy the beautiful 'eternity pool' or 'just' visit the regular view deck (which is reminiscent of a cheaper Mediterranean cruise ship ). The choice of ticket purchase also affects whether you can sit at a real serving or just buy a cheap copy of a Singapore Sling drink in a simpler kiosk. Regardless, it is worth the money, time and effort to get up here and enjoy the beautiful city - try to hit the time around sunset, when the light is at its best!"
"Everyone has already probably said it so I won't harp on too much, but without sounding too cliche..... it's a must do, no crowds, stinkin hot and wow what a view."
Spectacular views! We want to stay here next time in Singapore. Too bad we did not visit the pool...
"I decided to go to the sky park only because I was staying at MBS and it is complimentary for hotel guests.The views here are stunning! You can see the entire city from a 360 degree view, and it was less crowded than I expected it to be. There is also food and drinks up here so no need to grab them beforehand.I'm glad I didn't pay for the attraction because I'm not sure it's worth the cost. It really depends on you though. It's a fun attraction when it's free, but I would pick another attractive (gardens by the bay) over this if there had to be a decision made.Luckily, you can do this pretty quickly so there's not a ton of time spend up here."
"We stayed in the hotel, thus have access to it. It is very crowded during the afternoon. Recommended to go early"
"A different way to have a drink; relax and take in the views. We got some lovely views of the city and Gardens. Shame it was a cloudy day.It costs S$22 pp to gain entrance to the bar / restaurant area at the top but this fee is redeemable against food and drink. A cocktail will set you back around S$23. Food is pricey e.g. S$24 for small plate of prawns. That said, huge numbers of people go there for dinner so clearly popular. Be prepared to have a credit card retained if you're running a tab. There is a dedicated lift to take you all the way up. You can also pay to gain access to the infinity pool if you want a dip.Well worth it for the experience"
Lovely to go to the top of the hotel to the observation desk - it is 57 floors up so the view is incredible.We got a ticket that included the Singapore sling - not worth it in my opinion.
A visit that is memorable and unforgetable. Love the scenary and the skyline. Singapore looks different and beautiful. Go and experience it before sunset.
"We were on a 2 night stop over & got tickets from the hotel for the sky park and gardens by the bay . We went via the subway , which the hotel is close too.The building or 3 towers is just awesome , a real feat of architecture and engineering . The ground floor has two hotel receptions , shops and restaurants & is very busy.The skypark is at one end and wasn't that easy to find initially. Staff are on hand to guide you .We went up all 55 floors & the reception area has a toilet and photo shop.I don't like heights so was very unnerved by being so high up so had to let my hubby take in the views & take some photos. There is a small cafe selling drinks and a gift shop but there is no where to sit. Clearly they don't want you to stay up there for for too long. There is a restaurant too but on the day we went it closed at 2 pmI honestly don't know how they built this building as it is amazing but don't expect to see the famous infinity pool as this is only for hotel guests and the skypark is only one end of the top floor so don't expect to be able to walk around the whole level. The skypark area is surrounded by a tall glass barrier so is safe but you've been warned if you don't like heights think twice, I have never been so scared as I was on this trip."
We pre purchased our tickets from our hotel so we didn't need to line up. The views are amazing & definitely worth a visit. There is a small cafe at top where you can buy a non alcoholic singapore sling slushie. Refreshing on a hot day.
"We went in the morning and so it was not so busy at the top although it became busier after a while. The views were wonderful and because you can walk around the platform you get almost 360 degree views across Singapore. The ticket only gives access to the viewing platform and not the swimming pool area which is reserved for hotel guests.You can also enjoy a frozen Singapore Sling as you look across the city.My only negative (and why I have given this 4 and not 5 stars) is that there were no places to sit and there was not much shade and so, although you can spend as long as you like there, it is not comfortable to do so.However, I would recommend this to any visitor to Singapore because it's a unique opportunity to view this beautiful city."
The view from the infinity pool is amazing. You can even see the laser show directly from top every evening. Food is good too. There is separate adults only pool. the fact not mentioned on promotions is that its very crowded. That is bound to happen in a hotel with 2500 rooms or so.
Great views from the top. Clear barrier on the edge to see city skyline and surrounding area. fee is charged.
This is a fabulous place and we had drinks at both the bars at the top of tower 1 & 3. At tower 1 it is free to go up and views are excellent. At tower 3 you pay $22 which is redeemed at the bar and their is an additional payment to enter the viewing platform which I don't think is worthwhile.Drinks in both bars are expensive as you'd imagine but still worth the visit.
"We pre purchased the tickets direct from the Marine Sands Hotel web site and also paid for a Singapore Sling slush as part of the packageWe visited during the early evening arriving at approx 7pm and found the organisation to be rather chaotic partly due to the large number of people to few staffWhen we got to the top we found that you collected the Singapore Sling Slush from a small cafe at the top who also sold other refreshments, there's also a bar at the top where you can buy alcohol etc.The views were amazing and we were able to watch the Gardens by The Bay evening show from the top, having seen it the previous evening at ground level, it was equally as impressiveWell worth a visit"
"No charge for hotel guests and a nominal 20 odd SGD charge otherwise.Lifts were pretty busy and about 20 people in the evening queue.Once upstairs you can spend as much time as you like. The private entrance to the infinity pool is key card only - although you can go into the c'est la vie bar no issue.There is a souvenir shop that also serves food and beverage.Fantastic views - see the F1 track, gardens, high rise towers and beyond over the bay."
"This is the place to get fantastic views, not the giant Ferris wheel. Not cheap but worth it. You get gouged for food and drink too, so bring your own.Only one negative, there was absolutely no place to sit down, no seats at all, and no shelter from sun or rain ( the restaurant was off-limits to us when we attended) so your stay at the top will be limited by how long your legs hold out. For old people (like me!) I thought that was a bit shabby, even though it is a sneaky way for the operators to ensure people don't stay all day.Kim W, Gippsland, Australia"
"This is a good view from the top of the Marina bay sands hotel. Just keep in mind that you only have access to the very eastern end, so no taking a dip on the pool. The only downside for me was the price. For a family of 4 it cost $104. A bit expensive I thought for an elevator ride."
"It is definitely a highlight of this hotel. Beautiful views of the city, relaxed and a great perk when you stay at the hotel"
"Although it was a misty day when I visited the 'Skypark' because of Indonesia annual fire burning, I had a good view of Marina Bay and the surrounding areas including the 'Gardens by the Bay'. At this level there is no access to the bar. I would recommend paying extra and go to the bar a level higher where one can relax and enjoy the view with a drink or two specially if it a hot day. Please no not forget when buying ticket to mention that you are a senior citizen if you are. You will get discount and if you flew by Singapore Airline you get further discounts.To get access to the Skypark you must go to the Sands Hotels. The Skypark ticket office is just by the side of the hotel. While the ticket for the Bar observation area is within the corridor of the hotel. It is fairly easy to find either.Was it worth it? I think so for the sceneries. Choose a clear day if it is possible."
Can see the whole Singapore from this roof top observation deck at the Marina Sands Hotel. Very nice place to take photos for great memory of visit to Singapore.
Great shopping centreWalking around mbs area.Canal in the mall.Lots of boutique and high end stores.
A breathtaking observation deck just next to the infinity pool provide a spectacular birdeyes view of the wonders of Singapore.There's a nice cafe joint for those who enjoy cupper coffee with the views.
"This is a landmark destination and it attracts lots of tourists and visitors. I'd paid $22, on a Thursday evening, which is like a cover charge to Ce la Vi bar & restaurant on 57th floor.It was a cloudy day so I didn't get to see the beautiful sunset. The sky was somewhat light orangy and pinkish. Nevertheless, a panoramic view of the city and Marina Bay.From the 57th floor I went down to 56th floor Observation Deck for another look. That was a mistake, as the queue for the down elevator was about half an hour. Thank goodness the guests were all very patient and the queue moved in a orderly manner."
The View is fantastic from here... You can nearly see what they are eating in Batam Indonesia. The Ambience is lovely. One of the best Man made view in the world. You are nearly eye to eye with the pilots in the passing Airplanes but they don't have a Swimming pool on board.
"Well worth travelling up the 54 floors to this for the views on a clear day, but public access is limited up the top, hotel guests have an extensive area and infinity pool"
"Infinity pool is awesome, however is cold up there due to strong wind. View is indeed incredible , lots of tourists at the edge of the pool getting a instagrammable shot, beware not to drop your camera in the water!"
"The pool is amazing and frustrating in equal measure. It's great to swim in, if only you could avoid the people wandering around taking selfies.The views over the city from the pool are great. The views over the Gardens by the Bay and the harbour are lovely, although you have to look through glass.There are not sufficient loungers by the pool, but if you go into the gardens section, there are more loungers set among trees and plants and it's much quieter there"
"Wednesday 23rd October and we were on our way to the Sands Skypark Observation Deck.The observation platform is on the 56th floor and is 12,400 metres high and is located on the rooftop of one of the most recognisable and iconic buildings on Singapore's skyline.The ticket price was 23$SD, however, when purchasing our ticket we received a 15% discount because we were travelling with Singapore Airlines. The actual ticket price was 19.55 $SD, roughly Â£11 each.There was no time limit to the length of stay up on the platform, we spend roughly 1 hour up there.From the observation deck it is possible to see the landmarks and places of interest in Singapore. There were information boards around pointing out the sights. We were able to see, Singapore Flyer, Supertree Grove,The Quays, Science Museum, Merlion and so much more.While on the platform it was possible to climb the steps to the 57 floor for a brief higher vista. This floor had bar, restaurant and swimming pool, this was for the Sands Hotel guests and those that purchased the package. For us access to the viewing platform was good enough. There was a kiosk there which was charging 4$SD about Â£2.30 for a can of Coke Cola.A part from walking around admiring the views there isn't much else to do up there. It is not possible to walk all the way around the observation deck as it did not go all the way around."
Marina Bay Sands Skypark is a great spot for cocktails though it gets very busy. Warning - make sure you buy a ticket for the to level skypark on the same level as the Marina Bay Sands pool and not a ticket which only takes you to the viewing area. They won't refund the ticket if you inadvertently buy the wrong one which is easy to do as there is not good information explaining that different tickets for the different areas.
We didn't have time to see it at night so we went during the day. It was impressive but would have been spectacular to see in the evening with the lights on. Lots lifts but a nice place to walk around. We liked the Chinese garden too which had a little pocket of shade behind it to chill out and enjoy the scenary.
Located on 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands Hotel and lift lobby from tower 3. Fees are chargeable to visitors but free for hotel guest. You get to see 325 deg view of Singapore skyline. Beautiful view from above . The sky deck has 2 levels and these ends the boat like shape of the 3 towers. Enjoy the sunset here. The views are different during the day and pretty lights at night. It is a must thing to do when you visit Singapore. Great place to hang out.
"We made our way up to the top of the Skypark to grab a quick view of the impressive city of Singapore. My only gripe is that the Sands is such a marvel of a building, that you couldn't see it too!"
"Showers briefly threatened to close this attraction 56 floors up from the ground.The main thrust out the hotel is the Casino, hence the name Sands.The panoramic aspect of the Skypark is unparalleled , and makes for excellent Instagram selfies. There is little else there, apart from a fairly ramshackle shop.The restaurants and the infinity pool are out of bounds, but some paying guests in white bathing robes ventured down to enjoy the views ."
The Skypark offers a great view of the CBD of Singapore on one side and Gardens by the Bay on the other side.Spectacular!
"This masterpiece of engineering gives fantastic views of the whole of Singapore and is well worth a visit. The views are breathtaking but be careful!!!There are different ticket options so decide what you really want. I.e if you only want to take fantastic photos and get a clear view of the city then get a ticket for the observation platform.If you simply want to see the views, have a drink and/or something to eat then get the free drink ticket......this does not allow you on the observation platform!!!!You can obviously still take some good photos from the restaurant areas but they are limited by the deck and it's hand railing in some areas as this area is higher and in the middle of the deck.Lots of areas such as the infinity pool are also only for hotel guests so dont expect to have a swim!"
We watched the NDP Preview at the skypark and it was sooo awesome! Totally worth it. Seeing the Singapore Skyline is also great.
"56 stories up gives you a great view of the city and surrounds. 30 minutes on the roof is plenty, lots of good photo opportunities.We went mid afternoon, no queue but was quite hot. I'm sure at night it would be quite spectacular."
"There's no doubt about it, this has to be one of the most incredible engineering feats in the world. The amazing infinity pool with views that will blow your mind. We found 6 - 7am by far the best time to enjoy the pool and early morning views when it was quiet. During the day it was a no go zone for us as it was absolutely packed. But up to you how you want to enjoy this cool facility."
I love the Skypark though I've been enough times that it isn't quite so special now. You get great views of the city particularly at dusk when the lights come on in the city and on the ships offshore. There's a bar and other drinks available though you no longer have the run of the deck. It beats The Wheel any day.
First thing first. It is not the cheapest but well worth the visit.This is an open deck and there is also a restaurant and small cafe.However almost 360 deg view of Singapore skyline and what a view.You can see the river meandering along Spot the racetrack and Fullerton hotel. Then walk to the other side and see all the cargo ships and looking down you will find gardens by the bay. Absolutely amazing.Well worth the price even though it is still very steep
Nice scenery for some photo shots and have a drink or some bites. It was still pretty busy even though numbers are supposed restricted. We enjoyed and would take more guest next time.
"Well it is certainly an amazing view. But is it worth it ? $26 for the lift to the top. They do take your photo (tourist photo similar to when boarding a cruise ship) , but that's $30. There's a photographer on the Observation deck, but again $$$. Though could be handy if travelling solo. There's a cafÃ©, but no sitting on the observation deck and very little shade and if you have been to Singapore you know how hot it gets. There's a restaurant above the CafÃ©, however it's for hotel guest only. Though the views are amazing, sadly no view of the roof top pool. So that was disappointing."
"One of the boxes which needed ticking on our wish list, but found it an anti climax. Half of the skydeck was being refurbished and was out of bounds, which meant the same amount of people were coralled into a smaller space. Getting a seat at the bar was like a bun fight, we eventually got one and waited to be served, and waited and waited. Included in the admission is a credit amount for nearly as much as the ticket itself, great at least we can have a couple of drinks. WRONG. The drink prices are extortionate, barely covering a drink each and once they then add tax and a service charge, you still end up having to have to pay a few dollars more. The view is ok, having been to the Burj Khalifa this is nothing special, especially as you can only access certain parts of the skydeck. We visited a littel earlier than expected, so had a longer wait for the sun to go down, The extra wait meant buying an extra drink each (59$ or Â£33). Box ticked, but costly"
Unfortunately in that same location there is also that huge Ferris wheel stuff n so tourists r spoilt for choice. This we went up but found it limiting because the boardwalk had nothing else to keep us interested as the actual walk etc is about ten minutes
"And a decent Italian too if you fancy a pizza or a pasta or anything necessary to fill in the required minimum of hundred words in a review, on the 57th floor"
Well we got to see the view in a much reduced space. only a small kiosk serving refreshments. Nowhere to sit but at least we manage to beat the crowds coming from the cruise ships
"Recently visited the Skypark as one of the things you have to do while in Singapore. We visited in the early evening, just before it got dark. Admission on the ground level of MBS was very easy, and the lift to the top only took a couple of minutes. When we reached the top, that's where it all started to unravel. The skypark was rammed, with only a limited amount of tables and chairs, which meant us loitering aroung already seated people ready to pounce if anyone left. We eventually claimed a spot, but the view was nothing more than average, which was really the case wherever you sat.The cost of admission is 26$, for which you also get a voucher for 26$ to spend at the bar. Bargain we thought until you see the bar menu. Prices, even for a beer, use up most of the 26$, but it still seems a better deal then paying 23$ for the observation deck alone. The disappointment was really the view. You are confined to a small area which doesn't give a good view of either the marina nor Gardens by the Bay.After paying an exoberant 25$ for a second beer, we left very disappointed."
"We booked the skypark before leaving the UK as we weren't sure how busy it would be trying to book on the day.We were slightly dissapointed that part of the deck is currently under renovation which we were not informed about until we arrived but you can see get a great view of both the Singapore skyline and the vast number of cargo ships filling the bay then glance left and see the beautiful trees of the Gardens by the bay attraction located behind the hotelPlease be aware you cannot access the rooftop bar from this attraction you must que downstairs in a seperate line if you wish to go for a drink in Marina Bay Sands bar on the roof. There is a small kiosk on the sky deck to get water etc if you need a drink.It was slightly overcast the day we visited and extremely windy but still a great view, the view at night would be as amazing when the light shows are present which unfortunatly had been cancelled at this time due to world issues with the virus. Still a must for travellers of all ages."
"This deck is at the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel...an incredible piece of architecture in itself. It's not cheap to visit the deck, and they will also charge more for the obligatory photograph. Having said that, it is worth it for the incredible views of the city and the harbour. Having been once I would not bother to go again."
Coming from Melbourne Australia where we have the Eureka Sky Deck the Marina Bay Sands Observation Deck was a let down. Yes you see the beautiful city but in comparison it wasn't really worth the time and money spent. It's quite pricey to get up there and once you are up it was super crowded. I would however recommend this to people who are visiting from a country where there is no viewing deck.
Great views in many respects but a little overcrowded and ridiculously priced to buy anything once in there (get told you get pictures and videos included but then get asked for $50 for the photo)...
Go in the early morning or evening when it is cooler. The skypark is only a section of the top; less than one third.The free digital photos are a plus.
"We visited but were disappointed once at the top. We could see the trees and restaurant from the ground. Once you're up you can't get into the restaurant. You have to go down and enter a different way and I suspect, pay again. The viewing area is a small proportion of the total platform. The hotel pool and roof garden look nice but are out of bounds. There is a drinks outlet but nowhere to sit. This means, once you've taken in the view, there's nothing else to do. For 25$ + per person I thought it a bit of a RIP off. Oh, you do get 5 ""free"" staged photos from a green screen set up before you go up. In fairness, the views are stunning. Better explanation of what you get ( and don't get) is needed. Hence average review."
"Whilst you do get to visit the top, you don't have the benefit of seeing the hotel quest area(s). Views are good, especially on a clear day."
This place is great for views. You pay a lot to go up but nothing else to see and do when you up there. The souvenir photos are very expensive but you have an option to download.
"We thoroughly enjoyed the panoramic views but were bitterly disappointed about just how little of the top was available to non guests despite paying $23 each. For that you are allowed unrestricted time to take in the views. However, although you can buy drinks and snacks, there is no seating whatsoever and you are forbidden from sitting on the stairs or the deck. The area of deck available to non guests is just the tip of the deck and meanwhile guests look down on you from the bar and infinity pool above."
"Visited on Jan 5, 2020. Is a tourist trap, disappointing and obscenely overpriced for a very limited access (@ 25%) of the rooftop.they charge SGD 46/person and my be worth no more than SGD 10 / person"
"You could see pretty much entire Singapore.The view was priceless and amazing. However, when it starts rain, there is not many space to avoid. Also, too many people in pool area. It looked like people were swimming in a river, and it didn't not look like sanitized.....(my opinion)"
"The Marina Bay hotel is an iconic building and going to the top was a must. Unfortunately the inflexibility once up there was very disappointing.Initially we were going to purchase tickets for the viewing platform, at a cost of $26 per ticket, however we were informed that there was no seating and no shade. As it was a very hot day, we desperately needed some shade, so we opted for option 2, and that was to visit the bar on another section of the Observation deck. Prior to visiting the bar we had to purchase two drinks vouchers for $23 per drink. Once we were up there, we were told we could not sit inside the air conditioning part as this was for food. We sat outside, thankfully there was shade. We were then told the drink vouchers covered the drinks but not the tax. This cost us an additional $8.The bizarre and most frustrating thing, is we were not allowed to go to the $26 observation deck, even though they were next to each other and separated by fake moveable hedges. We were told if we wanted to visit that section we would need to go back to ground floor and purchase tickets at a cost of $26 a ticket."
"The creator of the Marina Bay Sands Skypark was smart. It was a license to print money. Of course, you're in Singapore, you have to go. But the Singapore skyline is not very impressive. It sure isn't New York, London, Tokyo, Bangkok or many others. It's a pretty small skyline. And as for the lightshow. That's incredibly weak. Not a patch on the one at the Bellagio, Las Vegas, or the one by The Address in Dubai. Singapore really needs to try better."
"One of those things they say you have to do, but wouldn't do it again. Great view, especially at night, but not really worth the fee or the crowd. Getting up was easy but had to wait in line 20mins for an elevator down."
"The view was nice and you could see a big part of singapore and (especially) gardens by the bay area. However, there were many people sitting down right beside the glass viewing ares and sits there for HOURS just to wait for the Supergrove light show at 8pm. Because of this, it is really hard to get a closer view of the city since space taken up by these INCONSIDERATE PEOPLE!. There is a restaurant above as well, however only open to hotel guests. The small beverage stand had very little variety of drinks and serves no food. And charges MIND BENDING prices for Tiger Beer (which is a horrible beer i might add). And in case youre wondering....no the pool is not accessible by non-hotel guests."
Yes - you can see Singapore. Yes - you can get epic pictures. Yes - it is kinda a must thin to do.However maybe plan your trip in a way that you are staying at the hotel instead of just booking a ticket to visit the bar.
The pool is a beautiful location to relax and watch the city through out the day but expect to be interrupted by the regular #tag Face Snap into chatters. Actually its hilarious watching them prepare and pose for their perfect picture and then argue with their family/friends because they didn't get it right.
"We visited the Marina Bay Sands Skypark on the night of the 2nd January and arrived just in time for the light show in the bay, which was pretty. The lights of Singapore and the Harbour are spectacular, as are the lights from Gardens By The Bay but there appeared to be very little else to this. Perhaps I'm reviewing the wrong thing, but there was no access to the pool pictured or anything other than a viewing platform and a cafÃ© which was full to bursting. Whilst I enjoyed the view, this isn't something I'd be bothered doing again."
"As I said in another review, the water is too cold to go into, so the only benefit I can see is to visit one of the sky park restaurants (there are several) overlooking the pool and people watch from the windows.There is also a bar on the upper deck if you drink. For those not living in the hotel there is a perfectly acceptable lookout deck--but with no beverages available."
"I was not a guest at the hotel so was only allowed to go to the viewing desk on the ship. I would suggest doing this attraction instead of the flyer as the views are spectacular! Although very windy so don't take a hat! You can spend as much time up there was you want at there are places to buy fast food and drink, souvenirs. The views are of the city itself and of gardens by the bay. You do get a small view of the swimming pool but the views of the other side of far better! It is rather pricy however what the facilities provided as once you get up there the isn't much to do other than look out... would advise an hour max at this attraction"
"Once we arrived on the top we realised that we were limited to a very small proportion of the deck, about 10%. The remaining 90% is not accessible. So, you can not have a 360Â° view."
"Online observation deck entry includes tea drink for 20% off vs free entry Bar but with minimum charge. It's misleading to think the bar entry is free since both work out to be similar in cost.Both have limited access to the top deck. With the bar, you are also limited by where you get seated. The outermost seats are still behind the observation deck. At the northern end, the observation deck extends at least 20 meters away from where the bar seating ends.YMMV"
Something you must do to say you have done. Views are beautiful and a must see but once you have looked around there is not much else to see. I'm sure you could pay extra to go to the pool area but we didn't. Would be better if you could use your pass all day as would be good to come back at night and see the lights of the city but it is stay as long as you like but only once. Glad I did it but won't go again.
"Visited at cost, with that charge credited toward food and drink, which are expensive.Great views, but hard to get vantage points."
The view is outstanding but the price is too high for a simple glimpse of the city from the 56th floor.
"I get that observation decks provide the most stunning views of city skylines.When I saw the Marina Bay Sands I could not wait to see the view from the top. I thought $23 was a bit steep but hey, I'm only in Singapore for a day.Little did I realize this gets you access to a tiny sliver of the north side of the deck. While the view is nice for a bit, there is little room to explore at all.Oh, and to add insult to injury... they keep the adjacent restaurant sectioned off for guests only. Because you're not really a guest and god forbid you try to spend your poor-person money at their fancy restaurant.This place must make so much money in every facet it's insulting to charge $23 to use an elevator."
I was a little disappointed with this overpriced attraction. I spent less than 30 minutes there perhaps it would be more attractive if you visit in the evening or night.
"My wife and I recently visited Singapore after a cruise from Fremantle. We decided to checkout the Skypark on top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel to get a good perspective and overview of this beautiful city. After purchasing our tickets we took the lift to the skypark and were certainly not disappointed with the views of Singapore's skyline and the harbour. We then decided to have something to eat at the restaurant adjacent to the skypark, but were informed that we could not enter the restaurant from the skydeck and would have to leave the skypark via the lift and return to a different level before entering this restaurant. This seemed a little bit odd considering there was an entrance via a couple of stairs from the skydeck. We were also informed that once we left the skypark we would not be able to return. Apparently the operators of the 'Skypark' and the adjacent restaurant were not prepared to co-operate, hence the ludicrous decision to prevent people on the skydeck entering the restaurant. For a tourist destination this was a little disappointing."
"The most stunning architecture in Singapore and $23 to go up the lift to floor 56 or 57 and what for? We were aware that we wouldn't have access to the pool or hotel areas, but the fact that there wasn't even a decent cafe or bar to enjoy the views from was pretty poor. You could buy a drink in one bar which was basically a counter.The views were amazing and we got some great photos with the zoom at its bests - photos better than the reality"
I have to say I am pretty disappointed with our experience .We bought a ticket for 33 dollars which included a frozen Singapore Sling.On the day we went it rained and we have been made aware by the staff which was nice . We asked then if we can transfer the ticket to another day but this was not possible ( so what's the point of pointing out the rain as it had been raining all day )The view on the top is stunning but there is no rain cover at all and we have been told we have to have our cocktail walking around in the rain. Cocktail was a cheap small class of ready made stuff. Not tasty and not worth 7 dollars . Not quite the experience I was looking for.After making a bit of a fuzz we were aloud to go up the bar and finish our cocktail .Not a 5 star experience
Thought it was a great idea to go to the top for $23 and this included a drink from the bar plus tax - so at the top you can't go to the observation deck ( different price ) only to the bar area - great view and beautiful at night - very busy which is expected but not really with tourists mostly workers at th end of their day.There was one downfall where the bar waitstaff were rude and ignorant and I have never been to a bar where the bar staff use their fingers to put the fruit and ice in to your drink - when I questioned this the manager said 'I have worked here for 5 years and your the first person to ever ask me that ' enough said !Been there now done that ! Great view but that's all it's got going for it !
"This was a little bit disappointing... Yes, you can buy tickets to go up visit the boat and check the view but if you don't live in the hotel you have access only to the front/nose of the boat and can't enjoy the pool or the park."
"Bought a ticket & wen tup in the elevator. Unfortunately, we didn't realise that you needed a separate ticket to enter the bar/restaurant. That ticket had to purchassed at ground floor, an dit was too late by the time we were on the top of the building. Lose a start for that. Too be honest, the gardens were 100 times better."
Very nice view but way too overpriced. I recommend the bar instead that has the same view and you can see the infinity pool too.
Great picturesque place. Better to visit at dusk so u can get a daytime and night time view . It's beautiful when lit up.
Busy busy lobby before you go up in the lift.Nowhere to sit out on the observation deck...obviously want you to pay the money and get down quickly!Yes great views but wouldn't bother again
We paid $20 per person to visit the Skypark and although there is a good view unless you are an hotel guest you are restricted to going to the top. A waste of money.
"In Singapore there is much to see and of course the wonderful Marina Bay Sands Hotel looms majestically and somehow creeps into many photographs while on the ground. We were curious enough to pay the dollars to visit the Skypark but opted instead for the extra floor where we could have a drink and take in the views. It was crowded, drinks a little pricey, but certainly worthwhile for wonderful views though one had to edge around a bit see them. The Skypark deck allows more freedom of movement but then there is no place to sit. Seating only in the bar the next floor up with costs more. While up there I wished I was on the Skypark deck itself as one could move around freely while we were pretty squashed up against crowded tables on the upper level."
"It's a good view, but there are plenty of tall buildings with bars nearby. Personally, I didn't fancy the crowds vying for pictures when the bar is more comfortable and less crowded for the price of a drink."
"Not much to say views where awsome looking over the habour and gardens by the bay. No access to pool area which is reserved for hotel guess. Bit pricey for the view no seatting or shelter from the hot sun and small food stand, with over priced drinks didnt even stay 15 minutes before I was bored and sun was hot. View was worth it but would only recommend if its a short trip last minute option to explore Singapore at its best"
Great view but that was about it. Was not allowed in the bar as only hotel guests. No where to sit and absorb. Went during the day left after 20 mins. Might try later at night to see if any better. A tick off the list though.
"View is nice. When you stand at Skypark observation deck, you can have overall view of Singapore, from Marina Bay, Garden By the Bay, Ferris wheel until Singapore's port. At 9 p.m, standing at Skypark, you can see whole of musical fountain show is performed at Marina Bay. It's very nice. But there is one thing that i feel unhappy at here. Gate pass price is expensive, about 25 SGD for one person but they don't offer any complimentary drink, even one simple and cheap kind of drinks is mineral water. And they don't have any free chair for you can sit. You must sit on the floor if you don't want to stand for a long time. If you want to sit on chair, you must come in the restaurant there and pay for drinks. Price of drinks in this restaurant is more expensive than the price at the ground around Marina Bay Sand Hotel about four times. But you want to have an overall view of Singapore, especially Marina Bay, you should come here."
Got to visit a movie set!Greats views of the city. Bit disappointing that you are only able to see one end as the other end for hotel guests.But worth the visit.Amazing engineering. WOW.The entire building is worth a look
"If you're a tourist looking to do touristy things, this is your place, but for a local it's overpriced and it doesn't really give you an amazing experience. Tried it when I first moved here, wouldn't do it again. (The view from the walkway by the Louis vuitton store is practically the same)"
"It's about $20 US and worth it to catch the best views of Singapore. Can't imagine anyone spending more than about 30 mins up there, as you have no access to restaurant or pool. Good for a quick view and get the layout of city. Would recommend from lobby area just booking a meal to one of the two restaurants, saving the entry fee on Skypark, and use that money to pay for food/drink. If I went back would do it that way instead."
Great view over Gardens by bay and city views. Top deck is ok but no seating apart from wooden deck to sit on. Restaurant & skydeck bar is for residents only. We paid for a frozen Singapore sling (slushy - in a plastic cup. Felt like a second class citizen!
"Of course this is a architectural world wonder, hut you will pay for it. come for drinks and enjoy the view for a few hours."
"The hotel provides is a truly spectacular part of the Singapore skyline. The purchase of tickets to the Skypark is easy and there are concessions available. However, although the views up there are stunning with lots of photo opportunities, the actual space you are allowed to go is very limited. There's a great looking bar up some steps on raised platform but unfortunately you can't access it unless you are a hotel guest. A bit of a tease really. Enjoyed the views, disappointed with the limited access."
"The view was good but it stops there , no seating very very crowded specially at night when the lights come on. Had a bad experience with the ticket satff who were rude. Not worth the cost of the ticket when there are other places worth seeing."
Great view of the city. And quite windy up there. I went upto the 56th floor. There are a few restaurants there. Needless to say they are extremely pricy.
"Glad we did this as we got a great view of the F1 track. Nice to be able to walk through the whole hotel which has the feel of Las Vegas. There are plenty of signs directing you to the Sky Garden. You pay $25 per person or $32 if you want a small Singapore Sling slush puppy. You go up in a lift, get you drink and look out. You can stay as long as you like but there is no seating. You can not use access the proper bar or pool. In fact you can't really see the famous pool. You are only allowed on the viewing platform at the tip of the roof. There is a bar and gift stand you can access. We had hoped to see a light show but it had been cancelled because of the Grand Prix, I think that should have been communicated at the ticket office."
"Possibly a must do if you want views & photos, but a little overpriced, especially if you add the $50 photo, however I'd still recommend it if you don't mind crowds & heights"
"We decided to visit this place, it costs 23 SD per person. The staff were friendly and is reasonably easy to find the entrance which you need to go down the escalator outside the tower.When you buy your ticket you walk round and you have to get your picture taken which you can get later a copy later on before you get in the lift on the way down from the sky deck.You are only allowed around a small part of the deck as the restaurant and pool area are only for hotel guests. The views are great from the deck but there isn't much else to do up there. It is greatly overpriced for the experience and is something like 50 SD just for the photo on its own or 80 SD if you want the key ring and something else. The views are good but don't expect much for your money. There isn't a time limit but with nothing to do other than admire the views and sit on the floor in the shade (which a sign says your not allowed to sit on floor). If you have the money and want to say you have been there then go for it otherwise don't bother as not worth the money"
If you are just paying to go up and have a look you won't see the image of the pool as this is for hotel guests only. You will get a nice view over Singas which will cost you $23 SD for the privilege.
After paying almost $50.00 we were surprised and disappointed to find we were unable to go onto the observation deck. With no acknowledgement from the bar staff after waiting for two minutes we took a couple of pics and left. Having been on the Flyer an hour earlier I would definitely reccomend it over the Marina Bay view. Mich better views and 100 times better service.
"The view is great, the area is ok, the price is too high for what you get. You get locking in on a very limited section of the deck. Very few drink or food options. The line up to leave it just absurd. It is a couple of hundred meters long after sunset. The access to bars and restaurants is completely locked of. It very limiting."
"There are better places to spend your time in Singapore as this is constantly crowded, especially the pool and top floor. The selection of food and shops is not fantastic either. The only draw for me was the fantastic view of the city on the top floor.Bottom line - constantly full of tourists, the food is mediocre and the in my opinion the only reason you should go is to savour the view from the top floor."
"Go for the view, a quick sunset cocktail. Very touristy, mediocre food and weak drinks. You do not get to experience the pool unless a guest."
"Nice, but not as impressive as I expected. There are better places for nice views of the Singapore skyline."
"The views are amazing and was on our bucket this so glad we made it however it is super busy , dated decor and no personalised service."
"My visit to this beautiful place was on my very last day. I would say, it was worth it. If you stay in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel then you should have no problem accessing the sky park or finding it. Getting to it from elsewhere, please make sure you tell the driver that you are visiting the sky park as there is a drop off for both hotel and park although you can get to it from pretty much any entrance, one puts you closer. There are signs to help you navigate to get to it. The lady at the desk/counter where we bought our tickets was very helpful. She even helped us sign up in order to get a percentage off one of our tickets. They also have staff on hand to take your photo so once you are finished with your tour, you have the option of purchasing the photo.If you are afraid of heights, then this is definitely not for you unless you want to face those fears ï¸They are pretty organized so you get up and back pretty orderly and quickly. You can stay for as long as you like. No one rushes you. Once at the top though you will feel like you don't ever want yo go back down. Being at the top for me felt like you are escaping everything, but as they say"" all good things must come to an end""The views at the top are breathtaking and beautiful. So peaceful and quiet. No traffic sounds just the people around you. It's simply gorgeous. The city is so beautiful. I would go here again."
"I thought we will have more fun there. But only going up to skypark isn't as awesome. Maybe others should try sunset-time but in the day we were here, we had clouds.Also I would recommend you to book a bar or restaurant in advance. Then I would say it is much more relaxing to stay on the roof and watch down.To be in the pool is only allowed for hotel guests. Surely exciting, but I would not book this hotel only because of the roof."
"Went up here in the day, the views were stunning, only issue was that it rained and there is no where to shelter up there apart from going back inside."
I wentvthere in the evening so crowded and humid so made me a bitbuncomfortable. Very close to nrt front bay station. Vto go up there you can either walk up the stairs or use lift. Avoid weekend or holidays to have good photos
"Of course it's an absolutely incredible view and very impressive - only if you're in the pool, or have a table reserved at one of the bars (which is of course, very, very expensive).I wouldnt recommend going up just for the sake of it as the tables will be full, and you can't get to the edge to see the views. But it's beautiful for what it is, if you pay the price. I just think it's ridiculously expensive."
"Even with discounts for being a senior and for flying in via Singapore Airlines, it was still $S 17 to get up to the top of the ""boat"" skypark. It is very very open and very very hot up there. While the views all over Singapore are fabulous, it seems rather overpriced. There is nowhere to sit if one is desperate for a very overpriced drink, $S 12 for a beer, $S 15 and up for a cocktail. There is also a $S 80 for a photo, 2 postcard and 2 keyrings of the attraction. Or $S 30 for, in my case, a most awful photo. Was it worth $S 17? Would have liked it more if it was $S 10!"
The Sands complex rooftop has greart views and some nice but expensive opportunities. The developers have tried to cram too much in and whichever outlet you attend may be a bit of a disappointment as they are not connected and prices are steep.
"We paid more than twenty dollars just to take a lift to this roof top. The view is very beautiful but i think this view is too expensive, we only spend less than 10 minutes up there."
"It's a great view but there is nothing else to do up there. At all. Look, take pictures and head down. Quite pricey but it's expected."
"For such an expensive hotel, you'd think the rooms would at least wow you. They did 'wow' me, just not in the positive way.. I was disappointed with the room. It was small, it wasn't decorated in any special way, and it just felt like any other hotel room. The only good thing about this hotel is obviously the infinity pool at the top of MBS, as seen by the numerous tourists on the first floor buying access passes to the skypark (they cannot access the pool though, it is for guests only).The pool was great, but it wasn't like 'OMG!!!!!' great either, but maybe I set my expectations too high to begin with. It did have a nice view and food/drinks were expensive, but unless you're in the adults only pool, you won't get much peace. The other pools are filled with kids with floaties and their parents taking photos of everything.I'd recommend just purchasing the skypark access ticket instead of staying at MBS. There are higher rated infinity pools than MBS."
Not worth the money. We had a better view from our 27th floor room at the Holiday Inn Atrium. Very few facilities were accessible to none residents.
It's A great view but very expensive. I had a Singapore sling and it was great but my wife's prosecco was poor. Even though we paid $44 to get to the bar on the top floor we still had to pay $12 for our drinks (you pay $22 each to get to the bar and get that value in food/drink tokens).
"I'd say this is an overrated activity sold to tourists. Sure, the view is great but the price and waiting time to get up to the 52nd floor then down again just can't compensate for it. The place is crowded and you're just there to take a photo for social media. There are far better places to prove you've been to SG. However, if the cityscape is what you're after, then the skypark is your best bet."
"We visited the top viewing gallery, but was very disappointed with the actual place, looks very faded and jaded, no one served us for ages, views were magnificent, drinks extremely expensive, too many smokers and burger smells. Think this may be a 'pick up' place as lots of dubious women on their own lounging about - but not drinking!"
"We love interesting structures so it was cool to see but the viewing area is limited. If the weather is nasty, there isn't much of a view. We had found a tour on the GPSmyCity app that included this so it was worth a try but I wouldn't say this would be a memorable event.FYI - you can't get to the pool from the observation deck. You'll have to shell out some bucks to stay in the hotel if you want that privelege!"
"Costs $20 (Singapore) per person to go to the top of the tower. The $20 is a credit for the bar at the top. Prices for drinks start at $20, so not cheap at all. Pint of Stella $20 (about Â£14) ,London would be proud of the prices. Visited at night and the views were great, but if you want to walk around the perimeter, it is another $20 each!"
"When we purchase the tickets ....it is only for visiting the top floor that is 56-57 floor of the Hotel Marina Bay Sands. Undoubetly, its a masterpiece of construction.....but majority of what you see on the youtube videos or what you hear about the MBS Skypark is not accessible. The view of Singapore is amazing from here. However, it is definitely NOT WORTH the MONEY charged in this tour.If you are with family including small kids....i dont think the kids will be impressed too much. But if you are only a couple....you can spend an hour talking at those heights.Now i was also advised not to go....but i still went to quench my curiosity with the logic....that i dont want to miss this attraction.....But i can say with confidence....if you have limited Time or Budget.....skip this without any guilt...Its waste of time and money. The place looks better from Fullerton square....attend the Light and Sound Show every evening at 8:00 & 9:00 pm. Its worth it and free. Good photo shop moments."
For whatever reason everyone goes to Marina bay sands and to the roof top. It reads and looks better than the actual experience. External visitors pay a hefty fee to use an escalator and get an inclusive overpriced drink. Its often crowded at the top and the space available to external visitors very limited to explore. Even for hotel guests this tends to be a sleeping factory with a large chinese population. There are so many other excellent roof top viewing spaces in Singapore that far surpase this one. Try one Altitude or a free observation at the Pinnical.
"The marina bay skypark is better looking up at it than looking down from it!Looks higher from below and as it is only 56 floors high when you view from the platform you think, mmmm! The skyline isn't amazing like Shanghai for instance or the view from say, the empire state building in new York so if you've travelled a fair bit and been up some of the world's tall buildings you Mau find yourself as underwhelmed as we were. Also, you pay 23 sgd to go to viewing platform where you can buy a drink from a 'kiosk'. There is no seating area so the 'poor people' have to sit on the floor! If you pay more and queue you can go a few steps up and sit in a bar and look down on the poor people. If you can afford Â£500 per night for a room at the hotel you can be one of those people who feel the need to show that they are even more superior by wandering around in a white pool robe and slippers with your bathing costume on...absolutely ridiculous."
It is made very clear to me when i accessed the observation deck that i was not able to access the bar and restaurant. So the only things other than the view was a little souvenir desk and small snack/ drink counter. So I spent all of 10 minutes up there. The view is good. But the best view in my opinion was over the Gardens by the Bay.I guess it's a must for a visit to Singapore but not convinced it's great value for money.
It would be awesome if the crowd ess could be handled so we as visitors are satisfied and happy in visiting the place.
Given that you can see the Skypark from almost anywhere in Singapore we took the mandatory trip to the rooftop for around S$38 each.We had to wait 45 minutes for the Ce la Vie bar to open only to be told that only hotel guests could enter the air conditioned area. Apparently their custom is more valuable than ours.
"It was a nice view but cost a lot to get in and I was told the cost can go towards a drink, so I thought that is fine, but the drinks ended up costing a lot extra"
"It's a view of a city from high up. Probably stunning at night, but nothing too special during the day.Worth noting that you can only access the observation deck and bar unless you're a hotel guest, don't expect access to the infinity pool.Worth a drink at the bar for the novelty factor, but once in, you can't go back out to the observation deck.Take any photos from the deck on the upper bar level, as the level below has high barriers that will be in the way."
"It is nice to see from distance. You will get a good view of Singapore from the top. Other than the view, nothing very special for this attraction. But it is just walkable distance from Gardens by the bay and hence can visit on the same day."
Great views and so worth the admission price. Wouldn't have a drink in the bar there though as very expensive
"We came here for the view of the light show. While very impressive, there is no doubt, the prices are exorbitantly high, even compared to the rest of the Singapore."
Great views of the city and the harbor.People lined up early along the railing to watch the light show in the garden below.We had access because we were hotel guests. I am not sure we would have gone up there if we had to pay the fee.
U get a nice view around the key marina view but there is an enterance fee. Can consider going to some bars on top where the cost of the enterance to bar can be converted to drinks though u can only see part of the scene but i think largely enough
"The Marina Bay Sands is a huge building - visible for miles it seems. It would seem wrong to visit Singapore without paying a visit to the Skypark.For what you get, it is expensive - approximately $23 (Singapore) for a ride in a lift and a view to three sides - non-hotel guests are (rightly) unable to access the iconic pool area.The view is good. But there is limited explanation of what it is you are looking at and there is no seating. We would have liked some detail about the build etc, but the whole experience seems to be about extracting the maximum amount of money for the minimum amount of effort.Are we glad we did it?Possibly.Would we do it again?Definitely not.(As an aside, we walked through the lobby of the Marina Bay Sands on the way to the Skypark entrance - the experience was akin to walking through the soulless terminal buildings of a large airport. There is no character at all. The, soon to be guests, were queuing within to be granted the privilege of checking in to an overpriced hotel room.This is a spectacular building.Stay elsewhere."
"Maybe my expectations were too high but it literally is a 'no thrills viewing platform'. There's a restaurant/bar at the top but this was closed when we went and I cannot attest to its opening hours.It's worth venturing up to the top for the nice views, and a bonus is it's a short walk from the shopping centre across the road, but adjust your expectations if you're expecting more than a observation deck.Cost was $23 for an adult."
OK by Singapore standards but expensive for what it is. Do not advertise enough that you can pay and go to the top but some does not open till 10am. Expensive and a bit disappointing.
"Was really excited about doing this early evening to see Singapore at night - we queued for about half an hour (which apparently is quick) paid $28 each and got our tickets which included a drink. Once you get up there is is extremely restricted as you are not allowed in the guests areas which includes the best views, the pool and a large section of the bar. We were so disappointed we complained and got a refund and a complimentary ticket to return another time but as we were leaving midday the following day we were unable to use. If you just want to see the view you're better off going to the viewing gallery!!!"
"So we caught the clean and swift lift to the top. No crowds (due to the Covid-19 downturn), and two good ticks in the boxes there.Then you leave the lift to be assailed by pushy salesmen trying to get you to buy photos of you against a view you haven't seen yet. Photos attached to some of the most tasteless tat I have seen photos attached to. The guys cannot take no for an answer....though they had to in the end.Then you get to either of the two platforms. ( I think in ordinary times it is one deck , but a good chunk of the prow is hidden behind tarpaulins, so a third of the attraction and potential views are lost). The deck is just that...a wooden deck. No seats, no signage indicating individual landmarks.There is a concession stand up there selling waht I'd call fairground food, but nowhere to sit and eat it other than the floor. (Ironically there are signs saying don't sit on the floor).Tip: If you are a big party or with kids, sure go up there but take a map with you. If yiu are a couple, book Lavo italian restaurant instead. Great food and a viewing terrace that will live in yiur memory for years.)"
I'm giving this a 2 because I felt they were ripping off the tourists. It's 26 dollars to go up to the skypark . As you go to buy the ticket they point out that only part of it is open due to a refurb on part of it but there's still no reduction in price. The place oozes wealth. Gave me a bad taste in my mouth. Rip off.
Great view but half the deck was closed and no one gave warning beforehand at that price should at least be told. If in a budget avoid otherwise great views of the city.
"The view from the observation deck is magnificent, however the Sands hotel takes full advantage of thier location.1. Entry fee is very expensive $$25 - $$30 per person, for riding up an overcrowded elevator to the 57th floor of the building.2. The high fee does not allow the visitors access to the entire roof, with it's tropical gardend, restaurants, and bars. Only to a small, overcrowded, area of that roof area.3. Too many people are crowding the side of the building, hardly allowing for one to get close to the edge to take photoes.Major disapointment. I'd recomend to stay away from this attraction despite the beautiful views it offers."
It's sounds petty but you can pay the money to go up for 15/20 mins but I was hoping to have a drink watching the sunset ..... but no it's a viewing place only
"Cost was over $100 for 2 Adults & 2 kids, way too much for the view.. we passed, then it rained, so lucky choice for us."
My wife and I paid to go and access the Skypark as we had seen the building on TV from overseas and wanted to check out the views and the overall design.Bit disappointed with the overall attraction. We arrived around 10:30am with not many people around. It looked like there were 2 x cafes on the roof neither of which were open. There was no public seating or any amenities on the roof area around the Skypark.The views were great - can't complain about that but I thought it was very overpriced for what it was. We went to Jewel @ Singapore Airport later in the day and it was fantastic and cost us nothing
"If this is the only skyscraper you have ever visited in order to see a view, you might be impressed. Otherwise, if you have been to any of Empire State Building, Burj Khalifa, The Shard, etc, this is all a bit underwhelming. And the light show is really not worth hanging around for."
"very expensive , you only get to see one part of the roof area. long queue to get in. great view from top."
"Great views all around but minimal facilities including seating and crowded. There are signs for features in the lsndscape but these are minimal and repeated. Expensive access, but everything in Singapore attracts a fee."
"Please do not be deceived by this, know exactly what your going to get. I genuinely thought we was paying to go up to spend several hours taking in the view, relaxing by the bar eating lunch and using the amazing infinity pool. In reality you pay s$33 to go up to a tiny and by tiny I mean the tip of one end of the Skypark to be crammed in to take pictures and use your voucher in a make shift bar for a almost non existent frozen Singapore sling!Please know what your paying for as we didn't!"
"Ok, you have a good view (but note: you are only at the very end of the terrace (corner towards wheel). But you can only have a beer/dring out of a plastic cup. You can't go to the restaurant/bar. That you have to book/pay separately. Also not vice-versa.And honetly the hotel itself isn't worth to stay there (too expensive, too crowded).In other cities like NY you have more to see on such a terrace"
This was limited - to purchase a ticket I had to use the escelator as there was no lift access. Once at the top the view was magnificant but there were no seats for me to rest and I was on crutches. There was very little shade or shelter either.
"Did the must do thing, bought the tickets walked completely through the bottom of the hotel to go to the top to find that you can't go all the way along the booking platform. Views are good but not worth the money."
"Although the views are amazing, the fact that there is no shade, nowhere to sit and limited space we were very disappointed. We understand that you need to encourage people to get through quickly and don't want them hanging around too long it was not worth the money."
The tickets to the observation deck are quite pricey for what you get. You stand in line and take and elevator up. You are in the top corner of the deck. You get some nice sites and can take some pictures but I was done in under ten minutes. And then down and out. I wouldn't do it again.
"The skypark is a very limited walk way at the far end of the MBS rooftop terrace. It has no seats, a very small coffeeshop (no seats!) and good views. But you can get good views anywhere without paying $23 each.I am sure the MBS hotel is great if you can walk in the gardens, visit the pool, have a nice drink, have a seat and enjoy the view. But you can't do that at the skypark, you just walk around a wooden walkway and take a few pictures before descending 20 mins later."
"We visited recently and stayed up there no longer than 5 minutes. The view is beautiful but there is nowhere to sit, very little shade and the sign that points to the restaurant is worthless when the restaurant is for hotel patrons only."
"Okay, if you want a really high view go and do this, but you DON'T get to visit the whole 'skypark', just a small end deck area (the bow of the ship). That's it. simple. $23 each for that and you might be happy. Whatever you do don't turn it into $73 by adding the photo. Seriously - I left after 10 minutes. If I had to pay for my family (4) to go up at that price I would have felt very annoyed once arriving and seeing what little you get to see. Small gift kiosk and a restaurant. And a large empty deck. And an exit."
Great view of the city but limited to where you can go (only one end) and there is nowhere to sit and relax to take in the view or have a coffee etc. Would be nicer if there was a cafe/coffee shop and seating available.
"Overpriced, super crowded, long wait to get an elevator down. A cattle corral experience. The views were nice but you can get just as good visiting one of the taller public housing structures and taking an elevator up to the top (google this, it's a thing!).Also if you get motion sick, at this height the building sways a tad bit and it's not enjoyable.We went at night and watched both the labor light show in the marina and the super tree light show in the Gardens but really wished we'd been on the ground for both of those, it was too high up and far away to get a wow affect from either.Would not spend the money or time on this again. We did not ride the Eye but I think that would have been a better but similar experience."
"Stayed in the hotel twice in the past and just visited to give my family an impression.I would say that any other 5 Star Hotel in Singapore would be a better choice.The lobby is a mess, long queues and the feeling of a provincial airport.No chance to relax by the pool with hordes of tourists walking around taking selfies.The building is nice from a distance, that's about it"
"We paid the $20+ each to go up to the bar at night and it really wasn't worth it. Its very difficult to get a seat, but even if you do manage to get a seat you really still don't get that good a view because the deck is in the way. The very limited view we did get to see was obviously impressive (this is why I gave it a rating of 2 rather than 1, which is probably what it deserves), and it wasn't a complete waste of time, but I would recommend you do something else."
You don't get to see anything but the view which you can see from elsewhere in singapore. Seems the hotel only want extra money
Went to the top of the Marina Bay sky park and thought this was over rated. We went up at nighttime and cost me $66 dollars Singapore. For an extra dollar you get a cocktail that is so full of ice that there is hardly anything to drink. We went up on a Monday night and it was crowded with night clubbers and you can barely get a view v
I am sure the view was nice but we decided in principal not to go up the top as we found the rates being charged outrageous for what was just going to be at a small viewing platform and did not include seeing the pool nor even being able to go to the restaurant. We found SINGAPORE in general to be so overpriced - especially for simple things like a cup of tea. Long gone are the days when Singapore was a place to go to for shopping. MArina Bay Sands is absolute price gauging!
"I paid $30 to go up to the deck to view the city and to get a 'Singapore Sling'. Upon arrival at the top it was boiling hot (I knew this as it was middle of the day). The thing that angered me was the complete lack of shade. It is just a big wooden deck that radiates heat with no where to go to get out of the sun. I found a cubic square metre of shade (literally) by a small souvenir stall. I could see everyone on the deck felt uncomfortable in the heat, trying to find shade. The Singapore Sling was a tiny plastic cup and very overpriced for the $10 price tag.So overpriced and will never go up again.I would recommend to anyone going up to go in the evening when it is cooler."
"We were disappointed by this visit to the Skypark. The architecture of this building is impressive and fun, but it's a tourist trap."
"It was recommended that we go up to the Skypark for the views and one way to do so was to have lunch at Spago. Forget that because there is construction and the view of the city from Spago is currently blocked. If you are staying at the hotel, you can access the pool on the rooftop and that might provide the view we were looking for."
"Not worth the price to go up, you would be better served spending $20 to enter the Skybar near Ce La Vi - you can grab a comfortable seat and look down at the people standing at the skypark platform below trying to take a decent selfie. Plus, your $20 entry at Skybar gives you credits of the same value that can be spent back on drinks and food."
"As a visitor, do not expect to see more than an observation deck with bar and restaurant. The rest of the facilities, such as the swimming pool, are reserved for the hotel guests."
Lot of effort and cost to get to a viewing platform that offers nothing else - not even a coffee or cold drink. A complete waste of time!
I was very disappointed in this venue . Sure the views are fantastic but there is no where to sit and enjoy the view .$80 for a photo package . No thanks . Paid $7 for sling which was a plastic cup with coloured ice . Singapore you can do so much better .
"If you like being surrounded by thousands of people in a great big airport terminal, where you are charged a fortune for everything then this is the place for you!We went up to the restaurant next to the pool and received possibly the worst service ever.Waited for someone to take drinks order, waited 20 mins for drinks to arrive, so ordered another round as they served first one!Eventually they took food order, and to be fair the burger was excellent, hence the two as a score.Â£150for a burger lunch and two beers way over the top, but are you paying for view or famous chefs name over the door?Overall an experience that was very bad."
Having paid 28$ apiece for a trip to the 56th floor. It was not worth the money. Hardly stayed for 20 minutes as there is no seating arrangement. A waste of time and money.
Great views but you are not allowed to walk around the pool or bar area (hotel guests only) so for my money Singapore Flyer is better. Although having a drink in Ce La Vi and enjoying the views was nice.
"Prices had been increased for CNY fireworks (even though we visited at day time) and there was no option for Singapore Airlines discount because of CNY. Therefore it cost $100 SGD for 2 adults and 2 kids to visit the observation deck. Once up there, it is a sparse deck with no seats or shade. Many people sitting on the floor. $10 for 2 soft serve ice cream cones (apparently they'd run out of cups) with no where to sit and eat them so they melted all over kids and floor (and me) within 5 minutes. Then no paper towels in the bathroom to clean up afterwards. View is great, but after 10 minutes, there's nothing left to look at. Can think of much better family entertainment for $100!"
"On the evening (mid January) that we visited the deck we were being told downstairs that there were two options:1. visit to the observation deck2. visit to the bar (also situated on top of the building)On the question whether you would have the same view, we were being told by a staff member that this would be the case. It turned out that this was not true.So if you would like to enjoy the view, I would recommend you to go for option 1. Option 1 is also cheaper and you might be able to see the rooftop pool as we could not."
"It's quite over prized considering the service on top, paid SGD 23. Not saying the place isn't good, the place is nice and one should definitely visit but it is not worth vide observation deck admission. Try exploring through Ce La VI, it's much better and you get the drinks with the money you paid to get on top (caution: knew through other reviews, didn't experience myself)."
"Paid $80 for a family of four to view 57th floor sky deck. Spectacular view of Singapore though only get a glimpse of the infinity pool. Went to have a drink at the CeLaVi bar, service was very disappointing for such a high class place. Waitress not very helpful or friendly. Ordered a Stella beer and it was not full. Then only one sip in and they bring me the bill. Seems like they want to turn over customers quickly. Won't be coming her again."
"We were looking forward to have a few drinks in the sky bar C'est La Vie! To see the views of Singapore and what everyone raved about.However we did not expect to be spoken to in such a rude and abrupt manner and on 2 separate occasions to two different members of our group.Although the views were spectacular, it ruined our experience of it.You don't expect that attitude and manner from a member of staff from that level of hotel. So we were very disappointed!"
"The views are wonderful. But it is crowded, there is only one thing to do, take a swim to the edge and take a selfie. Prob lu just me but I did not enjoy it."
I recently visited this as part of a night city tour and was not impressed to my mind its just three buildings with a viewing platform on as for the water display the least said the better!
We stayed at the Hilton but wanted to see the view from this stunning looking hotel as it had been recommended by friends. To be honest although the views are stunning we found it all pretty disappointing. The service on the top deck was the worst we saw in our whole time in Singapore and it definitely felt like they didn't care as they had our money. It took an age to order drinks and snacks. The drinks took ages to come and the snacks didn't appear. We had finished our drinks and were trying to pay (we gave up on the snacks) and they almost insisted we stay and wait for the snacks ! We needed to leave and they eventually 'boxed' the snacks which took more time and we had an appointment and we just binned the box anyway. Enjoy the view but expect poor service.
"No doubt you get a great view of the city from there, but the area that you can access is very limited. It's all done in 15mins for 23SGD for non-mbs hotel guest! It's a tourist trap!"
"We had actually contemplated staying at Sands during our recent SIngapore stay but over the years, having stayed in Singapore dozens of times, we have developed our favourite hotels and decided to stay with one of them.And we are so pleased that we did, this was an awful experience! We decided that since we had never ventured to the newer parts of Marina Bay we would hop down to Sands and have quiet drink whilst taking in the view. What we found was simply awful.There is a queue for the elevator to go up and you have to pay SGD 20 pp for access. This is then deductible from drinks at the bar. We had 2 glasses of red wine, which came to $80 (that's about USD 50+ for 2 glasses of wine. You also can't access the best views by the edges because all those areas are reserved for hotel guests, as is the pool area; which is actually fair enough because if we had decided to stay here we would have expected nothing less.The place is crowded and touristy and highly reminiscent of the atmosphere in Vegas and the people it seems to attract are also the same type of people you find in Vegas, so if that's what you are looking for, go for it!! It wasn't for us and we won't be back and certainly won't stay in the hotel in favor of our regular quieter, less crowded more personal and intimate hotels, of which there are many in SIngapore. There are also many other places to have a rooftop drink with great views of the Singapore skyline.In our estimation, this place is a fad which will wear off and in the meantine represents a noisy, crowded over-priced tourist attraction.We were so pleased to get back to the peace and comfort of our regular hotel away from the tourist crowds at Sands."
"Pay to get access. Nothing up there but the view (which ok is a good one) but theres a cafe kiosk that made us feel like we were imposing on them, no seating other than a couple of bar stools and nothing else. lacked any effort to create an experience apart from selling you a staged photoPre-book on line to avoid a queue - we just accepted that it was a tick of a box, do it once to say its somewhere we had been, not something we would do again now."
"Did not enjoy our visit - We were told at the ticket desk that it is only the viewing deck that we could visit & although the views were amazing there were only 3 seats there (all occupied) & as my Wife has mobility issues she needed to sit down. We asked the bar person if there was any other seats they could provide only to be met with an abrupt ""NO"". So she sat on the stairs next to the 'do not sit on the stairs' notice!Please put a few more chairs up there !!!"
"Not much info provided where to buy the tickets to go up. Tickets to panorama terrace were 23 sgd, but going to the sky bar which is just 1 level above was 20sgd, fully usable to buy drinks or food up there. Extremely expensive restaurant. Staff are not tge friendliest. Better to see the panorama of Singapore elsewhere."
"To be honest, if you are looking for a bar with a view this place just is not worth it. The service is rubbish, the prices are really high and it is big, crowded and very touristy. We had a much better time at Level 33 in the Standard Charted building."
We took a walk down to the sky park to purchase tickets so we could return later that evening to get a night time view. We walked away without any tickets and didn't return. The lady on the reception kiosk was very abrupt and didn't encourage the purchase but discouraged. She advised that buying the ticket in advance was a waste of time in case the weather changes. I understand her point but given the weather forecast was unlikely to change that evening within a matter of three hours I'm unsure why she wouldn't encourage our purchase. She also went onto explain that unless your a resident you can't access the bar of pool. Only walk up to the front of the sky park. Not worth the expense when you can view the sites from the
"Don't waste $23 per person to go up in a lift, be spoken to like you are a nuisance by the kiosk girl on the deck and asked $80 for your digital photo in a frame or $40 just for a digital photo! RIP off central"
"The price for a non-guest of the hotel to visit the skypark is over-the-top considering it's basically just a viewing deck. Not a good-value experience. Photo op is good (SIngapore skyline), but not worth the price."
"We went up as a large family of about 25 people. It wasn't a great experience, queue management is poor and the payoff at the end wasn't worthwhile for the ticket price of SGD 23 per head.Queues were about 30 minutes to go up (about 6.30 in the evening), and about 15 minutes to get down (about 7.45). Some of us decided to go up later around 9.30pm. There was no queue then.The views were great, but are of a cityscape that could be anywhere in the world. If you know Singapore, it can be interesting, but if you don't, well, you might as well be in Shanghai, Paris or Kuala Lumpur just to name a few places with tall buildings.There's a restaurant or two up there, but you need to book, as they're quite popular. Otherwise it's just selfies, photos and a kiosk selling some cold drinks. You can swim at the Infinity Pool, but you need to be a hotel guest. It's all slightly pointless."
"The only time the entry fee is worth it is after sunset.Save the money, go directly to the Ce La Vi bar, spend it on the expensive drinks there :-)"
As a visitor if you don't book a room here then it is not worth to visit this place. Ticket price is not worth for the visit.
"Compared to other options. You do get a nice view, but not worth the money. Other attractions offer more for a smaller fee / no fee"
The observation deck offers breathtaking views which are worth the outrageous entry price of $23 but the bar is incredibly slow and amazingly expensive but not very good. My advice is enjoy the views but steer clear of the bar.
Views... amazingStaff ... useless. The ticket lady insisted on not buying the tickets because it might rain!! Luckily we didn't listen to her and went ahead
We made mistake by visiting Marina Bay sands sky deck. There's nothing to do after going up to 56 floors. We already visited Singapore flyer in the morning and experienced the view from top. Charges are very high to just go on 56th floor of the hotel. This is the only activity where they charged $ 17 for my 2 year old kid. Rest every where his entry was free. I don't find this place worth money and time.
"I lucked out and the lady at the Skypark told me that if I wanted to see the hotel pool that i could go to the Ce La Vie lounge. The lounge was free, had amazing views of the city (better than the skypark's small area).-- I will note that to go to the Ce La Vie bar there was a dress code; something about smart casual and closed toe shoes for men. After I went to the lounge, I walked over the bar and no one even said anything, but if you indicated you wanted to go to the bar downstairs at the elevator, they looked everyone over. Anyways, I also asked a staff member where I could see the super trees, she showed me that if I went to the right after you get off the elevators on the 57th floor, that there is a little spot to look out right before the hotel guests check in for the pool. It was fabulous! There was one other person there, so I got good pictures and it was FREE. So, don't waste your money on the Skypark."
"1. You don't have access to the whole deck, about twenty percent at best2. Not enough table and chairs3. You pay twenty dollars per ticket which is refundable when you purchase food or drinks, good deal eh? No! Small beer and glass of wine costs over fifty dollars4. You cannot see the light show very well unless have seat by edge. When seated at edge you cannot see the detail of the show or hear the music because of the height.5. The most interesting part of the sky deck should be the cantilever part but this is closed off due to people commuting suicide6. It's like herding cattle to get up there"
"Its just average, and nothing much to see except to say that you were at an iconic place. So be there but just dont spend too much time and more around to other places where you could spend your time valuable while on trip."
"15 mins to get the ticket, 30 mins to reach the Skypark and then 55 mins to get down. The whole excitement of views were killed by the massive lines for the elevators to get down.Three elevators for thousands of visitors. Perhaps our mistake was to go there on a weekend, was quite forgettable."
Not much to do up there except looking at the view. Not sure the price you pay is worth it. I prefer the flyer.
"Instead of the 'skypark' with its limited views, no cover and no drinks - skip this and go to the Spargo Bar. We were very dissapointed. Staff at the Marina Bay hotel say they don;t know about the Spargo (Tower 2) because they want to rip you off with this place."
"Visited the Skygarden while on a trip with my partner. It was so underwhelming.Only the tip of the area is open to public, the rest is for guests of the hotel, which is far enough.Its basically a decked area to enjoy the view. It does that but calling it a garden is a bit much. Not a single plant up there... just decking, expensive food and drink along with... well not a lot else. For me it couod he so much better.There is a restuarant up there but no menu on show, check it out online and wasnt keen.If you want to pay quite a lot for the views then great this is for you. Personally I wasnt that keen."
"Its very confusing trying to find where you can see a view. We went up in a lift and were turned away. We didn't know you had to pay for the viewing platform. We thought you could go to the bar and have a drink if you weren't a guest. Anyway, we ended up in an elevator with a guest who used his key card to access it. This gave us access to the top bar outside. I don't know whether we should have been guests or not but I don't think so. We waited for ages for service and kept hearing people complaining. Yes, the views were amazing but it was very posy and there was thumping Ibiza chill out music going on constantly. We are much more your colonial hotel type e.g. Raffles and Fort Canning Hotel. We wouldn't choose to stay there nor pay for the viewing platform. I would, however rather fancy a dip in the infinity pool and would have happily paid for a day pass for that but they don't do them. Do it if you feel it is a must but we didn't particularly enjoy it."
"Really, this attraction was not anything special. Others better. Children were bored, hot and disliked the walking. The childrens attitude was pretty much ours."
Good view from the top but not good value costing $S20 to go up in the elevator. Cost of two drinks at the bar very expensive and no access to view the infinity pool for a look. Not a place I would revisit when in Singapore again. Staff not very helpful when compared to other venues.
"Beautiful place, nice and clean can spend lots whole day in there. plenty of shops and restaurants, great view of whole Singapore."
"An observation platform with an horrific price. And I had to refuse the photo 3 times before they would let me past them. I was up there for 10 minutes. Lovely views, very little information about what you can see. I didn't eat anything or try the bar."
"View is breath taking but exceptionally high (over 40 SGD) for an elevator ride, go up the super tree instead."
Too much Vegas or Disneyland for me. I like natural beauty not manufactured beauty. I am not a fan of faking nice environments. I feel like this is fake. Singapore is an amazing city. Inserting Vegas into this beautiful place is a mistake in my opinion.
"While the view is good, the space is spartan and there is no where to sit. I was disappointed and didn't feel it was worth the entry fee."
The sands sky park is a long walk from the gardens by the bay. An elevator whisks us to the 55th floor. We can have a good view of the city from the top. There is not much else to pass time.
"When you enter, a staff member took two photos if you before taking the lift up to the sky deck. When we got to the top there is a stand where you can view your pics and if you like them you have the option of purchasing them. The staff there presented them 8n a nice folder and we were shocked when he told us it will be $60.00 Singapore dollars (which for Aussie the exchange rate at the moment is almost 1:1)... When we said no thanks he said the pics only will be $30.00 ... We still think it was too much for 2 doctored photos and walked away, feeling slightly miffed at the inflated tourist prices.The view was breathtaking. Please note that the viewing platform is not covered and if it rains, there is very minimal shelter for visitors on the deck itself. We got rained on but watched spectacular lightning storm cowering in a all corner of the souvenir stand.You might see stairs that lead to a bar... However the bar and infinity pool(7th floor) is only available to hotel guests.All in all, I still think Sydney tower has better views and better value for Money."
"Ok so we came and spend around $400 dlls in drinks and they just take for ever ...! Of course they charge a mandatory service so is super bad, we order French fries and we had to go to ask to the bar what happened with the fries .. and they ignored us .. so in general it would be to go somewhere else to spend your money"
"For the price you pay to go up to the too I wouldn't say it's worth it at all, you get to see the skyline of Singapore for sure but 25 dollars each seems a bit ridiculous."
"Any normal tourist would want the opportunity to visit the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. There is a beautiful view of the Central Business District and Gardens by the Bay.However, there is nothing up there other than decking and a coffee shop with no seats. I've visited tourist attractions as the top of buildings before (N Seoul Korea Tower, Empire State Building, Eiffel Tower and Rockefeller) all were way better designed for tourists and more comfortable for enjoying the insane view.The staff at the ticket desk were also very slow, quite rude/abrupt and not very accommodating - unlike most of the other tourist attractions in Singapore!"
As others have said you do get a good view of the city - but this was the disappointment of our visit to Singapore.After $23 each we waited in line for 15 minutes to ride the lift up to the spartan observation deck. What caught our eye more than the view of the city was the long line of visitors wrapping along the railing waiting for the lift down. After we took in the view it was more than 30 minutes in the sun & heat waiting in the queue for our turn back down.So many great places in Singapore to visit and thing to see. This wasn't one for us.
"You do get a good view. I was very disappointed, as my idea was to sit on the observation deck and have a beer overlooking Singapore. It was very hot the day we went. There is no access for the general public to sit at the bar its only for hotel patrons to use. There is a little shop that sold souvenirs and cold drinks but there is no seating at all on the observation deck."
"Went to the top levelHad a beer and a mock tail, they may not charge to get in but buoy do they make you pay once in the barService goodView spectacularReturn, only if I win the lottery"
Don't waste your money or your time! Spent so much time in queues for tickets and lifts than on the platform which had limited access. Better spending this time and money elsewhere.
"It's worth going up and having a look but it is a rip off. You have to pay $20 to get up there to the bar AND if you want to go on to the viewing platforms, then it's an extra $23! Also, they tell you that you can redeem the $20 for the bar with food or drinks...sounds good...but no, they have you again! You have to still pay tax on your drinks. So even though you get the $20 off, you are still paying something. I feel this is just a tourist trap. It's a nice experience but way over priced."
"Best to visit this place for free if you are staying at MBS hotel,othereise you need to pay just to get the view which you can get from any hotel room with city view. Although it gives you almost 360 degree of city view but thats all you get."
"Go up there, take your photos and begone. One thing i cannot get with singapore is how someone invests millions and then hires little boygirl joe from the house in the green pastures to waiter in the most cool of locations. Great taste in art and flowers but not in running clubs. Mediocre finger food with mefiocre drinks made by 18year olds. I mean common guys respect the money you invested."
Thought the entry price was expensive and there was no place to sit when we got there !You were not able to see the infinity pool unless you were a guest at the hotel. The views were very good but not worth entry fee in my opinion.
"I made every effort to find ticket sales after catching a cab to the venue.i specifically stated I wanted to dine or go to the bar. I was sent out side to bye my tickets at the downstairs sales counter. Once at the 56 th floor , the Sky park we walked around and then asked how to get to the restaurant/ bar. No Madame you can't go there your ticket only gets you to this level. Not one seat to take a rest and my friend who has a disability was expected to stand for 1 hr to wait for the light show. It was unwelcoming and expensive if you can't even sit to enjoy the surroundings. Had we been given the opportunity to buy the correct ticket at a different place we would have been given a discount off our dinner or drinks.The light show was underwhelming I must say."
"For those that wish to surround themselves with pouty lipped individuals taking selfies then this is your Mecca, you will be in good company. Yes, the views are great but for me it was not worth having to deal with the crowds and over priced drinks. Subjective, perhaps, but there are sufficient of us that abhor this type of tourist trap that may find this type of review useful."
"The view is fantastic, but that is it. You only have access to the observation deck, not the Skypark, so it's a lie. The observation deck have no shadow, no benches to sit, just a small kiosk so you don't starve. As there was no benches, many persons sit on the floor. Then every 5 minutes a hotel representative tells everyone to stand up! Very disrespectfull, they obligate you to stand. I did feel like a prisoner. But again, the pictures are great."
tooooo much crowded and only one or two elevators for everyone and then it is not easy to find taxi there. it is the entrance for Garden by the bay.
We decided spend our money on a high end drink and nibbles at Spago instead. The views are pretty much the same and it is more pleasant and cheaper to chill out with a 'Sundowner' Happy Hour cocktail ( 4p.m to 7p.m Mon to Thurs) than pay the price of a ticket to the Skydeck. Staff are very welcoming and the atmosphere in the bar is relaxed. Highly recommend.
"don't pay for this, instead go to ce la vie, and have a drink for a few dollars more while taking in the views"
Feeling amazing to look Singapore panoramic view from here. But for me it was overpriced scenery and they asked $65 for both photos that we took. It was weird when the ticket was only $23 though. I did not have a lot of time to stay. It was raining when I went to the deck.
"Thumbs up: The view really is excellent, particularly around dusk as the city lights up.Thumbs down: Although the view is incredible, I cannot recommend visiting the observation deck as a tourist not staying at the hotel. The price is not cheap and the whole place is designed to herd visitors through like cattle.Top tip: If you are planning to do the observations deck, give yourself a few hours beforehand to visit the Gardens by the Bay and then walk across to Marina Bay.Conclusion: The experience felt like I paid $23 for an elevator ride. It may be said that it is similar to paying to climb the Eiffel Tower of Empire State Building however, having visited both those attractions I can say the experience is just not the same.The city views are nice, just don't expect much more."
You can only see a small part of the skypark. Most of it is blocked off for patrons of marina bay hotel with pool and bar that you can only see from afar.
Visited this hotel as heard so much about it. Did not stay here and do not doubt rooms are fabulous. We decided to have breakfast here and were very disappointed. Very expensive but assumed the quality and variety would match the price.it didn't. Layout of breakfast area clumsy.
"$23 to go up 57 floors only to find no shade, no place to sit and $15 drinks. The pool and the restaurant are for hotel guests only. I am 100% certain that the no shade and no place to sit is by design to keep the crowds turning over. Oh yeah, the view is great for about 15 mins. I'd pass..,."
Great setting. Great barman but very overpriced! Take your credit card!Pick a nice day for great views
Awful ripoff. The viewing area takes up a very small end of the roof so you only see from one side. Then we had to queue for 1.5 hours to catch the elevator back down. An absolute disgrace!
My partner and I paid to go and access the Skypark as we had seen the building on TV from overseas and wanted to check out the views and the overall design.Very very disappointed with the overall attraction.It looked like there were 2 x cafes on the roof of which were open but not able to access them . There was no public seating and you are not able to go anywhere else unless you are staying at the Skypark.The views were great - can't complain about that but I thought it was very overpriced for what it was. Very misleading as I thought it was a sky garden not just boards
"In simple terms there is nothing there except a view.There is no real refreshment stalls and one tacky souvenir shop.There is NO access to the swimming pool, which is actually what the MBS is famous for, it is only for hotel guests, even hotel guests visitors can not access it.Save your money and go on the Singapore Flyer (wheel) which is nearby. You will get a much better view of the city, albeit another $10 or $15 more.So do not waste your money at the Skypark.Incidentally, we live in Singapore and have stayed at the hotel, the pool is not all it is cracked up to be anyway, my wife has also visited the skypark and said it was a waste of money.We take all visitors on the Flyer, this is the best way to get a view of Singapore and pick out places of interest to visit later.Thank you."
"So many people were spending money to go to the skypark when, for much better value, you can go to Ce La Vie bar on level 57! A simple question at reception revealed you can go up to this classy bar with better views for virtually the same price.Go to Tower 1 and the Ce La Vie desk on the ground level and purchase a ticket for Â£11 English pounds. Then go up to level 57 and you use your Â£11 ticket as credit at the bar for drink or food. For an extra Â£2 we all enjoyed a fabulous cocktail with a much better atmosphere and incredible views. For the same price there were people just walking around a plain observation deck!!! They seemed completely crazy to us! Additionally, the bar wraps around so you can wander and get various views as well as going right to the edge of the famous infinity pool.It was an amazing must-do experience in Singapore. Please don't waste your money on the SkyPark - go to Ce La Vie bar instead!"
Visited and stayed at MBS earlier this yearWent to pool for a swimIt was totally packed by parents children and sightseeing publicDid not enter the water as I had concerns about the quality of the water with the amount of people using the facilityOverall the whole area was full of people and it was not a place to relax or stay for too longThe views from the top are indeed excellent but the whole experience was disappointing and I will not be returning
"Firstly it is expensive. Secondly, the view isn't the great and you can only walk around about half of top of Tower 3. The other areas are restricted to hotel guests.Better scenery to just walk around the marina or garden by the bay.Really wish we hadn't gone."
"Visited this hotel to check it out before booking, mainly due to Crazy Rich Asians Movie!!! Thank goodness I did. There is an observation deck and the Ce La Vie bar that is open to anyone for about $22. Unfortunately if you are using the pool you're looked over - like you're in a zoo and the foyers are busy with tourists (yes like me) having a look. For such an expensive room rate I'd preferably choose the Raffles for the heritage or for a better overall experience the Sofitel City Centre Club Room and just visit the Marina Bay to have a look see. Hint : don't pay for the observation deck, pay for the Ce La Vie bar and you get a drink as well!!!!"
I've never left a trip advisor review before but felt the Marina Bay Skypark observation deck was very overpriced at $30. This included a frozen Singapore Sling. Normally $23 without.When you get up to the deck your not allowed in the bar only for people staying in the hotel.The customer service at the shop where you get a frozen drink was dreadful. The person running it could not even be bothered to get off his phone but I also noticed he was rude to the people behind us. There's no seating or shade.
So you get herded up there in a cramped lift. Then when there you can only have a drinkStanding up. They then want to charge 80 dollars for a photo. Staff that I spoke to were unfriendly and should not work in that environment very disappointed and not typical Singapore. Waste of time and money
Waste of money as Skypark Swimming pool is not open for Visitors. Its at the top of building from where you can see entire Singapore. The same experience you can get by taking ride in singapore flyer
"I already knew before going that we wouldn't be able to access the pool, but wanted to be able to get a bite to eat and sit to take in the view. The board with the ticket prices said there was a cafe which sold light bites like sandwiches, so we paid the $23 to go up. We tried to go into the restaurant area but were told only hotel guests could access it. There was a very small stand on the deck itself which only sold drinks, icecream, nuts, and chips, and there were no seats and no shade to eat it in. It felt like a rip-off for $23 - we didn't do the Singapore flyer, but I'd suggest giving that a try instead."
"Attracted by the many positive feedbacks, we decided to visit the Marina Bay rooftop. Unfortunately it was a really disappointing experience. The pool cannot be even seen, the rooftop is very crowded and bad organized: few chairs, people who 'conquers' them holding the chairs for a long time, so that you cannot even take a decent picture of the view. Entrance is expensive (22 dollars), but drinks are even more, starting from 23 + taxes and services.We really could not see anything. We expected more. Very very disappointing. Not recommend."
90% of the space reserved for hotel guests only. Limited views for the paying visitors running the silly green screen photo shoot in the lift queue. We visited on a weekend. Many sad and miserable looking groups parked on the floor against the outside rail blocking access to views. Far from expectations.
"Absolutely disgusting! Â£55 for a family of 4 to get up to the sky deck to find no restaurants or bars that we were allowed in to as we weren't staying at the hotel, deck far too crowded to see very much followed by a ridiculous queue to try to get back down ... massive downer at the end of an otherwise great trip to Singapore!"
"If you want to be one of the sheep, experience poor customer service then this is just for you. A waste of $22. Especially given we had the benefit of going on the Singapore flyer first. Recommend pay the extra and have a premium experience on the flyer instead."
to use the bar or restaurant here you need to spend at least 1000$. Absurd. At that kind of money you probably end up sitting next to kardashians or chinoRussian oligarchs anyway.
"My family visit the skypark in July.Never expected toddler they also charged @ 17 sgd. She is less than 3 years old, doesn't know even ABC.How come they sucks up everything , not acceptable at all."
"a high-speed lift will bring you to the rooftop. no shelter from sun or rain, a simple rooftop which you can literally pass in minutes. explanations of what you are looking at in various languages. small coffee-shop for a limited selection of snacks/drinks (bloody expensive) and thats it. you can not enter the pool or restaurant area (hotel guests only)."
"Small, cramped, and overpriced. Yeah the view is nice, but you really feel like a 2nd class citizen when you squeeze onto the 'skypark' and are literally looked over by the people staying at the Sands. Yeah, the hotel cost 4 billion US to build but you think that they would recoup that from the gamblers not the plebes that want a view."
"Even though it has a nice view over the city, is extremely expensive. We payed 23 dolars per person and you are only allowed to stand in a deck. There are not even chairs, or shadow, or real place to sit for coffee!!! There is a restaurant that can be access only after 6pm. When entering, they take a picture of you which you can after purchase for 80 dolars!!!! Completely ridiculous!!! Use the money for something else."
"Do not pay for this, just go to the Ce La Vie restaurant and pay $22 and haves drink in the bar and your $22 is credited against your bill. The view is better than the Skypark."
"I done this on my holiday, this was due to all the great reviews. This is a costly trip only to go to the observation deck. Beautiful panoramic views but nothing else. No information regarding the amazing build, no shade. We decided to have a cocktail in the bar. I knew we had to give our ticket over but on the understanding this would come of the drinks bill. The women looked us up and down then seated us in the middle of all the smoking area. We asked to move out of the smoking area to be told its this or go down stairs. We ordered cocktails and the bill arrived with the drinks. The waitress wanted payment before tasting. We where charged full amount with a large surcharge. I just paid in cash but she never even gave me the $9 change I was due. So to put it bluntly; it's not worth wasting your money and to be treated in this manor. I was truly embarrassed to be there with my friend's. Disgusting behaviour"
"We went up in the evening to see the city and the super trees lit up. Yep, you can see them through the crowd. Lots of people sitting against the clear barrier made it hard to get a decent view or photo. There's limited access to the 1.2Km top deck. Only guests can visit the infinity pool and only restaurant guests can get to the next level. Public is limited to about 1/4 of the area at one end. At SNG$46 for 2 adults its an expensive way to get a view. You probably should go there but its not worth staying long."
This maybe sounds a little thing but in this '5+star' hotel no.... We came long way and booked two nights to enjoy sunset cocktails at the rooftop pool and service has gone bad... third time here and we ordered cocktails and still water with ice.... weiter just told us to drink our water from nearby tap (wtf) Views are still nice
You have to pay a hefty price to walk round a small observation deck with no seats. Access to the gardens and pool area is not allowed after paying a hefty price ($54 over 65's price) so you are restricted to a view only. This cost gave you a small container of weak frozen Singapore Sling.For us it was not worth the effort.
"Beautiful garden with lots of different types of trees and plants. Flowers are everywhere, and it's great to see the park goers start coming back. It brings back a sense of normalcy, or life before Covid. Orchid Garden is amazing. Thousands of orchids in full bloom. Plus the restaurants there serve decent food, so you can spend the whole day there without worrying about anything at all."
"Botanical Garden is my favourite park in Singapore. I often come here to walk. It is big, well maintained, beautiful and a green santuary in the middle of city.The garden is always buzzed with actiivities during weekend.Although i visit the garden countless times over the years, i always find a new path & it has never stop to amaze me.Please visit if you have not been.RegardsML LEONGSingapore"
One of the best gardens I have ever been to. Lots of paths leading to gardens with different themes. There's a big lake here and an amphitheater where concerts are sometimes held.
"Very good place to walk, take pictures and appreciate nature.There are just too many people walking around with no mask on under the pretext of exercise."
"This UNESCO Heritage site is definitely worth visiting. Situated in the center, not far from the famous Orchard Road by a walk, or easily accesible from bukit timah road (next to Botanic Garden mrt), its refreshing to walk in the gardensIf you are a nature lover, you can walk the various trails incl Learning Forest. Experience the fly-by from various soecies of birds and butterflies. Walk around the calm waters of Eco-lake or visit the National Orcid Garden.You can stop by the restaurants/cafes for a relaxing drink or meal to end your time at the garden"
"I love bringing my kids (2 under 4 years of age) to visit the Botanic Gardens. They love searching for the chickens and roosters that inhabit the area. As well for the kids park , so many things to do with slides, sand pit , water plays area (this is not open yet), and my oldest favourite the flower/plants area (she loves the shy plant)."
I love the garden and go there for regular walks to get out of the city. Its quietness is perfect for a stroll with a Baby or Toddler. Just be aware of mosquitoes around waters. Mostly the trees offer shade but there are paths with a lot of sun so bring protection!
"Our first run and breakfast together in 2021, under wet and cool conditions.At 21 deg C in Singapore, it is so much easier and relaxing to chill in bed and snooze . Nonetheless, must try to remain disciplined and motivated.I have never seen this Cluny food hall in Botanic Gardens so empty before. Everyone was likely still hibernating before the first week of 2021 commences.Happy 2021 ahead.#choowai2021 #wongchoowai #wongchoowairuns #clunyfoodhall #botanicalgardens #botanicgardensingapore #run #running #newyear2021 #newyear #breakfastideas #botanicgardens"
"Despite my repeated visits, I am always in wow of new flowers that bloomed and learning the names of some trees out of the many.I was pleased to see the renovated toilet facilities which occupy the Burkill Hall Outhouse. It is user-friendly towards mothers with children and babies.The orchids are flowering in the Orchid Gardens which is free to enter.One of the trees around the Swan Lake has an apt name ""fairy petticoats"" as the flowers look like it. Beside the common red stem fig, I saw the Dinner Plate Fig as the leaves are like the size of dinner plates.Despite walking past the Ginger garden many times, this time I noticed that the wall mural outside the Halia restaurant shows all the different species of the Ginger family.At the Learning Forest near to the toilets are some flowering Ashoka trees with its gorgeous bright flowers. After the wooden bridge, I also noticed the RISING Tree which was planted by PM Lee Hsien Loong and the President of the Republic of Indonesia, His Excellency Joko Widodo."
"Energised by an excellent Hertage tour delivered most competently by a very experienced guide, I decided to spend more time at SBG by heading to the Orchid section. and was abruptly halted by a Hitler-esque , bouncer like individual who demanded yet another check in . I m totally surprised as I had already done the necessary earlier with all details given and even have a sticker to announce tht official entry logistics has been done . Strange and illogical that the orchid garden ,sited clearly within the SBG behaves as it if its NOT part of the Garden .. There is no entrnce fee , so the staff at this entrance are clearly extranous and really shd be deployed elsewhere. The brutish bouncer character would be most suited for entrances where outside contractors need to be processed before they enter high security areas . Sadly , it has been only a year since the former director who had hailed fr Kew Gardens has retired and the grace and charm of some of the gardens personnel have already deteriorated ."
Great place for photo shooting for major occasions like wedding etc. Surrounding swan lake with real big white swans are also spectacular view. You can take close photo shot of them. Nearby is the orchid garden with hundreds of breed of vibrant singapore orchids. And there is this famous Halia restaurant with its truffle fries good enough for two. Basking in nature and sipping a cup of hot tea during the weekend morning is so relaxing.
a very pleasant and nice environment for walks and exercise.clean amenities . excellent greenery.great place for outings.
A nice place to enjoy nature with your families or friends. Escape from the bustle city. Feel relax and comfortable.
"Lovely to walk through the greenery, spot a different bird, a special flower or a creepy crawlie, and recently many adopted trees with Christmas decorations."
"There is so much to see here, it never gets old. Now that it is Christmas season, there are plenty of lovely Christmas trees and decorations from one end of botanic Gardens to another. Also, got to see a black Swan at the start of the route. A black Swan event indeed!"
"One of my to go place, lovely parks where you see semi wildlife animals, good to go for a jog and explore the place"
"Since I was young, I always like this garden. Till today, I still prefer this garden so much.The greenery is nice and the garden is maintaining well and thanks to the NPB for their hard work."
"I'm a frequent visitor to the Botanical Gardens. A UNESCO World Heritage site and so well deserved.You can see so much. If your visiting from overseas maybe you want to see it all, but if your local - just do it section by section.A few days ago I spent the whole morning at Symphony Lake - overlooked by a statue of Chopin. I saw Malayan Water Lizards having a territorial dispute. Beautiful birds, dragonflies insects, turtles ..... this is the most amazing and special place to just sit and look at nature display itself before you.Prepare to be amazed. Never hurry - take it all in and it's sure to impress."
Great place for a family picnic. Sit by the little pond watching the swans and enjoy your food. Plenty of restaurants around inside while a couple of cafes at the entrances serve good food.
"This was one of the best places we went in town as the gardens are both exotic and meticulously maintained. Lots of unusual plants to look at, and it is all just gorgeous. Can be hot and steamy."
The best place in today world to run away from the big city smell some fresh air and let your kids run wild. Just wish could. Circle there
"Explore all the special areas like the Healing Gardens, Swan lake, the Orchid garden. great cafes and supermarket inside on the way. Accessible by public transport.."
"Singapore's first and only UNESCO Heritage site. A beautiful, huge park that's an easy walk given its mostly flat grounds and many trees providing good shade along the way.Saw many families picnicking on the grass patches too. There are also mini museums and themed exhibits within the Gardens (a good escape from the heat for some aircon)."
This is like lungs of Singapore .... and every time I go there I discover something new ... centrally located and full of things which every age group of people can enjoyMust visit place
I enjoyed a sunny day by checking out the botanic gardens in Singapore. The place is spacious and there are a lot of fun things we can do. Even reading the sign boards is a past time.
"The ground is very well-kept. It is perfect place to do the exercise and enjoying the greenery at the same time. The orchid garden is also worth visiting, too."
It's a excellent place It's a nice place to jogging and walkingThe place is very clean and nice and Good The place is very good And clean And Val maintain Clean air Everyone should go there
"Underwhelming, a bit underwhelming is my view of this place. I was surprised to see so many locals stunned by their own local fauna."
"Orchids Garden, free entrance during Convi-19, happy to visit over weekday, less crowd and can enjoy the beautiful nature."
I can highly recommend a visit to this beautiful garden! Lots to see and experience with all these different plants and flowers. One can easily spend a couple of hours there.
My favorite park in Singapore. Lovely morning walks and runs when its cooler and less crowded.A must visit if you are new to Singapore
"If you are Irish (white and pastey) the Singapore sun might not assist you. So take my advice and take an umbrella. It helped keep us shade in the shade and stopped us from being sunburnt, but also protected us doing the downpours."
"My wife and I were exercising this morning at SBG, walking and sometimes jogging...it's a beautiful and big park, with many things to see and enjoy, suitable for almost everyone.We can also do group exercise here, but must apply permit in advance for it. For individual exercising & activities no permit is required, and no entrance fee as well.Worth to visit while you're in Singapore."
We visited the Botanic Gardens on our last day as we hadnt pre planned anything so decided to go to the Gardens and we were just glad we did its just magical loved seeing the squirrels and the beautiful swans on the lake id highly recommend anyone going here
"Nice and beautiful place for family outing, enjoy the natural floral and nice food restaurant over there."
"Contrast to the hustle and bustle of the city next door. A UNESCO heritage site, the garden is a welcome change to the concrete jungle fringing the garden. It boast different varieties of flora and some resident swans, monitor lizards and chickens. They are gracious host and allow visitors to take a leisurely stroll, jog or those who are more energetic training for the olympics....not literally. Many small groups of young and old dispersed across the open spaces exercising from the slow and deliberate tai chi to the quick and driven serious sportsmen and women high impact workouts. Contrasting these movements are the monitor lizards stamping their authority on the footpaths, posing for the curious passers-by taking a selfie or wefie with it. The occasional rustle from beneath the majestic trees where a flock of chickens or clutch of chicks foraging thr earth for their favorite delicacy of worms. Those who seek serious knowledge of horticulture, there are also paying visits to the specialty flora sections like the Orchid Garden for a small fee. Otherwise, novice horticulturist can benefit from the free information parked in front of different plant species. Good for family visits or a great getaway for some me time too."
"Just love our Unesco listed Botanical Gardens so accessible now with the MRT circle line ending at the Bukit Timah Entrance. We arranged to meet at 10am but because the rain got heavier took refuge at the Bees'Knees for coffee until it became a mere drizzle. The cafe was crowded and short-staffed so some customers got impatient but it served a very good croissant and Cappuccino for $7 and $5.50 or $6 respectively.Then we went to our favourite stretches of the Symphony Lake with its statues of Chopin etc, enjoyed the huge lily pads, the one beautiful white swan, the Herconium Garden, bamboo groves, trellis pathway, unusual trees like the Brazilian cannonball and aged banyan. The write-ups were most informative and it was a delight to sight birds like plover, sunbird as well as catch glimpses of salamanders crawling along pathways and staircases.Meanwhile a profusion of bougainvillea, frangipani and other blooms delight your senses while kampong fowl make their way on the grasses,crowing occasionally.We had lunch at The Halia which is now halal with local dishes and international selections like pizza and salad but do make a reservation as space is limited with social distancing requirements now.The food is good though a trifle expensive and they sell bottled jam and sauces.The Orchid enclosure is open to seniors at $1 per pax and there is a small waterfall, spice garden and numerous benches for lounging as well as clean toilets and a water fountain at Cafe Verde."
I love greens and long walks! So I will come over often!We used to do a picnic over there every month! but we stopped for awhile!Its big wonderful and cheering place ! A bit far from the center but it has a mrt just in front of the entrance!enjoy your day!
I've always recommended tourists or my clients here for wedding or family photoshoots cause the place is huge and the greenery is amazing. Bandstand is one of the most iconic place in Botanic Gardens. Remember to take some photos there!
"Overall, the weather was hot & humid. It was difficult to cover all the places in botanic garden. There are barely shops/vending machines for you to get any drinks/snacks. Please be prepared for this."
"I figured nothing could suit what I saw after I went to Singapore's Gardens By the Bay. Yet I realized that it was difficult to select one over the other when visiting the Singapore Botanic Gardens. With the most amazingly large, old trees, the gardens are immensely vast ... every tree has been labeled ... What loving labor! The entire region is available to those who give families such a blessing. It has just a ticked entrance to the Orchid Garden.The entrance has a magnificent clock tower, decorated in color and kind by tastefully picked orchid plants. There are small pergolas laden with orchids, small enclosures of delicious landscaped trees , rocks, swimming pools and cascades, from which the rich colors of the orchid rises and leave the beauty without expression. There's a popular garden with orchids named after famous men and women and an orchid displaying the famous botanists' orchid. You will appreciate your care to maintain the ""run"" of the floral orchid plants and the ""back-up"" fields awaiting their turn. The entire idea is something to be respected and I am grateful for seeing the natural glory!"
"Amazing landscape and lake view !Location: 4/5Environment :5/5Facilities: a lot of pavilion and kwan area for all sort of sportsCondition: 5/5Wild life: wild chicken, lizard, birds around the park"
"Most beautiful garden in Singapore. Full with life, history, well organised, a great place for a decent long walk and exercise with pet dogs."
One of the best-reserved places in Singapore. It's very well maintained and one can spend hours roaming around or just relaxing. The place is vast and probably will take you more than half a day to fully explore it. I always enjoy going here for morning runs and then treating myself to a good full-filling breakfast in one of the many award-winning restaurants located inside the garden. Recommended full time .
One of the best place for both local and tourist if you like nature. I always get lovely surprises during my visit...
"These are excellent botanic gardens. There are also ample spaces to have a picnic or hang out with friends in the open grassy areas. There are numerous trails and plenty of wildlife to see including monkeys, lizards, and swans (at the swan lake). I went during phase 2, and people seemed to be social distancing. Of course you have to scan the SafeEntry QR code when you enter the gardens. The entrance is very conveniently located right outside the Botanic Gardens MRT, which is on the circle and downtown lines. I would recommend going on a cloudy day because Singapore is so hot and you will sweat walking around if it is not cloudy."
"Such a beautiful and relaxing place, event if you've been to Gardens by the bay - one doesn't exclude the other. You can spend all day there. Easily accessible by subway."
"everyone knows what a botanic garden is.but this garden is unique in the many exercise groups scattered all over the garden, that allows anyone to join in the exercises any time you prefer. You dont even have to acknowledge the leaders leading the exercises"
"The gardens need repeat visits. Each time there's something new to discover.Explore all the nooks, the special areas like the Healing Gardens, Swan lake, the Orchid garden.Take plenty of water. It can get hot.The Cluny Road exit has some cafes and a supermarket.Accessible by public transport, close to Orchard Road"
"If you haven't done it before, whether you live here or are visiting, do yourself a favour and go to the Botanic Gardens one morning between sunrise and 8am and have a beautiful, tranquil start to your day. Guaranteed to make you feel better than you did!"
"Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, this is a beautiful and peaceful haven to recharge the batteries at. Accessible by one of the hop on-hop off buses or local bus. Well worth a visit."
"Lovely gardens to walk around, see the wonderful trees and plants. You should see Monitor Lizards as well."
"To satisfy my travel yearnings, I decided to exercise and sightsee our very own and only World Heritage Site-SBG with a dfference. I included an activity ( quite like a treasure hunt). I hope to introduce this walk cum activity to my friends or anyone who is interested. Beside the exercise, the thrill of discovery and knowledge gained contribute to a really great walk.There are about 13 theme gardens and I usually start from the Bukit Timah Gate and exit from the Tanglin Gate. SBG is not very large compared to the other World Heritage Garden (Kew Gardens) but it is much larger than the World Heritage Garden at Padua. SBGis the most visited botanic gardens in the world- a must for any tourists or locals alike."
"During the Circuit Breaker that I had to stay for 100 days in Singapore, this was the place to do my evening walks every other day."
"This is a huge area of parkland and gardens. As you stroll through, you come across different areas with groupings of specific plants for the displays being created. Eg there is a ""prehistoric"" cave/rocks and fern area, as well as many others.Make sure you take plenty of water to see you through, until you get to one of the eatery places, near the shop, which is well positioned within the gardens.It is easily reached from the MRT, with the station at the entrance to the park.The Orchid centre can be found within the park as well, so two things to tick off your to do list for Singapore!Lots of wildlife around too, including lizards and colourful birds, so keep your eyes peeled."
A must visit in Singapore. Easily accessible from the MRT. The Orchid Gardens are a must see whilst in the Botanical Gardens. There was an offer for free students whilst I visited - which was much appreciated.
"I went for a slightly longer walk on one of the days during the lockdown, eventually ending up at the Botanic Gardens. Surprisingly busy despite it being a very hot day. But still just as attractive as ever. Remains well worth a visit."
"i look forward to walking the lush grounds where the grand heritage properties Inverturret & Atbara stand. i The Gallop Extension of Botanic Gdns is beautiful, set against a ridge & untouched rainforest.Exit the main Botanic Gdns @ Tyersall Gate or get in via Tyersall Rd, this little extension is a neat breakaway from the usual crowd.Quiet - u find lots of birds, butterflies & even bees!"
"Always a pleasant place to spend the day in Singapore. Brimming with animals (otters, monkeys, chickens, squirrels, turtles, swans, and other birds), flowers and butterflies, its hard not to enjoy a trip here.Some cafes and restaurants as well if you need to escape the heat or wait out a storm."
The highlight of the park is the Orchid Garden. It has to be one of the best in the world! Visit the seed bank to learn how species are preserved. This is a huge place. As soon as possible get a map.
"Make sure you have some good walking shoes on because there is so much to see you'll be walking for a while. It's hard to believe you're in a busy city as it's a tranquil, peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle.This place is gorgeous, it was particularly humid day and it was quite difficult for my partner to walk (permanently on crutches) so the very helpful staff lent us a wheelchair making the whole experience much easier. It was only mildly hilly so the pushing of a wheelchair / trolley wouldn't be an issue.I would allow a good half a day to full day here and the best part? Free entry! It's a must see on your Singapore visit."
"This is the first place I've been to when I step my foot in SG!Nice scenery, very relaxing place and you would for sure will come back!"
"One of the world's great botanic gardens. The emphasis, of course, is on the tropical, so it does not have the breadth of, say, Kew. But it is stunning and well-presented nonetheless. Get there as early as you can to avoid the mid-day heat."
Been there with my boyfriend and we really like this beautiful garden.It is so huge that we spent hours there.Seen many families having picnic there and also relaxing themselves.
Really like this place to relax and buying time to see some of the most beautiful unique orchids and gardens.
If you like to think you can go to this place to think what you want .Also this place good for wedding photoshoot and picnic as well.
"the place is huge and you can explore around. u can walk ur dogs there, you can have picnics , you can even held some small gatherings there( Only after CB is lifted. hahaha)"
Good place to relax with family. Has a wide variety of rare orchids and flowers. Well maintained. Quiet place.
We really Love this place so peaceful to walk round beautiful flowers and plants a must visit for all.
"Make sure to bring an umbrella or hat, water bottle and sunblock! insect repellent would also be good.. Overall a great place for picnics and family hangouts."
A real treat to wander around the botanic gardens. they are massive and feature all sorts of treats. The plants and the wildlife are stunning. My companion was surprised to see Banans growing here. But this is one of the most inclusive gardens in the world
This is a wonderful place to visit for a calm couple of hours in the city. There is a stop here for the hop on hop off. Great place to take the kids as well.
We were dropped off by a taxi but got lost when we tried to exit at the same spot. This is a large garden with big beautiful trees and a lake with interesting swans and ducks. We walked through enjoying the gardens as we headed to the National Orchid Garden. There were a few gardeners picking up stray leaves and keeping everything looking perfect.
"It took me a while to think of what is Singapore's signature and not until I returned did the answer come, Gardens and Botany. Raffels knew it when he created the first botanical garden as he first set up the city. On Tripadvisor, 5 of the top 10 attractions are gardens.This is the most historic and traditional of those gardens. However, this is not one garden but rather a series of gardens that would be the rival of any community on their own. Their is an orchid garden, ginger garden, healing garden, children's garden, bonzai garden, palm valley, rain forest and several of the most beautiful lakes.My wife and I had a couple of hours on the morning of my 50th birthday and this was the perfect place to spend it. We took a cab to the main entrance off Orchard. We then meandered our way through the various gardens to the complete other end where you can catch the rapid transit. This is the best way to see it all but the healing garden as we went on a Tuesday when that garden is closed. I was simply blown away as I had never seen a garden so diverse and yet so complete as this. I know my tripadvisor profile says I have only seen 13% of the world but this is World's Best.I don't care if you say gardens and botany are not your thing. If you come all the way to Singapore, you can not skip something this World Class when you are there. For Singapore, this is an absolute MUST SEE. The best part is you can see all of this for free (except the Orchids, small price). This is an unbelievable community asset and a true highlight of our trip."
"Just had a lovely time visiting this beautiful garden space with a large variety of well manicured lawns, hedges and trees..would suggest for anyone visiting Singapore..just managed to fit this in before the crisis.!!"
"This was really great, a prefect place for a long walk on a day when we didn't want to be in the city. Even though the garden technically is right in the city it doesn't feel like it at all. Really beautiful variety of trees, flowers and every kind of plant. We also ate in one of the restaurants, and the food was really good if a bit expensive. The gardens are free to enter, but the National Orchid garden costs S$5 per person, totally worth it though in my opinion (huge orchid fan)."
"amazing, beautiful, well maintained and lots of different walks possiblerelax in the Singapore botanical garden - nice to walk especially early morning when there are not so many people and tourists.interesting parts of the park like rainforest, evolution garden, orchid garden etc. - lot to learn about nature and evolution of the earth.enough places for refreshments and food availableseveral entrance gates reachable either by car, metro or busthe entrance is free"
The botanical gardens are well established and very well maintained and provide a variety of different well paved walking areas to stroll around and completely enjoy the environment
"Tranquil and serene, a great place to immerse oneself in the forest in the morning, enjoy a little sunshine and many breaths of fresh air."
"Very nice place to rest and relax. Big territory, a lot of paths to walk and enjoy different plants and creatures."
Well worth a visit. Caught a taxi to get there as fares are cheap. We viewed the Orchid gardens and then went to the Forest trail where there was an abundance of cute squirrels. The gardens are big and we didn't have enough time to visit everything.
Spent a day wandering around the gardens and constantly stopping to admire the breadth of plants and orchids in particular on display - great location - easy access from city centre and good venues for refreshments and drinks.Well worth a visit when in Singapore
"If you are in Singapore, this is worth a visit. The gardens stretch for quite some distance with pathways taking you around the amazing displays of orchirds, shrubs and trees. It is spotlessly clean and a total delight to all the senses."
wonderful gardens probably the best we've visited .Allow three hours at least with the odd sit down to admire the skill gard work and design of the gardens
"Took a trip on our first day in Singapore, was not disappointed. They are out of town, so took the mass rapid transport, Metro. Took about 5 hours to walk around. Orchid gardens are well worth a visit. The gardens are mature and well laid out, with a few cafes and ice cream sellers. Its a pleasant place to walk around, and even better if you have an interest in plants. Allow 3 or 4 hours for a basic visit, longer if you have time."
"Beautifully laid out and maintained, perfect for a leisurely stroll. You need to be conscious of the heat and humidity so take it slowly."
"I stopped off at the botanical gardens whilst doing the hop on/off city bus tour and I am so glad I took the time out to visit. There is no entry charge to the gardens themselves.The gardens are absolutely beautiful with waters falls, a large lake and a huge variety of flora and fauna. I visited on a very hot and humid day but there are plenty of shaded areas to walk through to give you a chances to call off. As you walk through the garden you will come across The National Orchid Garden, I didn't go in as it was there was a cost, but there are enough orchids display outside for you to take in their beauty.I stopped for breakfast whilst in the gardens at a little place called Pepperoni, well worth a visit and a great place to watch the world go by."
A must do for flower lovers. It was a lovely place to relax and smell the flowers in a big city. Its huge with a wide variety of beautifully landscaped tropical gardens and flowers. I would go back in a heartbeat!
"Going for a stroll after work, cooling, windy, shady and nice colors combination of plants, trees, shrubs. Nice green field with small little lake and bridges."
"This place is close to how I would paint heaven. I run here at least a few times a week and this place is fantastic, well manicured park with tropical plants and lakes. Well done Singapore National Parks"
An interesting day walking some of the gardens here. Some great plants and trees to be seen here. The otter display at the start was good especially when they started walking through the park. Great place to visit.
"As you might expect, only 90 miles from the Equator, everything grows here. A profusion of tropical trees, shrubs and exuberant outbursts of colour. The gardens were almost empty when we went early morning before the heat of the day. Well worth a visit"
Came to the gardens at the end of a week long business trip and it was nice to have something so tranquil and peaceful to do after a busy week. The monitor lizards were a bonus. Clearly worth a visit!
"These are not your average Gardens. They are so creatively presented with clever use of plants, walkways, themes, refreshment facilities and superb maintenance. There is so much to enjoy that we used two half days using the 'morning cool' to advantage. The Orchid section is great. Start at the top of the Botanic Gardens and work your way down."
"Excellent site for a walk-one of the best places to spend a relaxing Saturday/Sunday. You can easily spend the whole day. Family/kids friendly, pets friendly, there are a couple of restaurants, cafes and gift shops and several hills, lakes and gardens to explore. Must visit for sure!"
"To have set aside this huge piece of greenery in the city centre takes will, guts and consistent determination.As with most venues in the point city, go early. Weather is cooling and sun glow is warm.Several breakfast is available at park enterence."
"These large botanic gardens are quite diverse in their offerings. Orchids, bonsai, an arboretum, a swan lake, frangipani, a jungle - just some of the offerings. And it's free to visit although there is a very small charge to visit the orchid garden.Restaurants, toilets, garden shops - they're all there as well.There is lots of shade in most areas because of the trees but it can get quite humid. We're in Singapore, after all.Well worth a visit especially cr garden enthusiasts."
Absolutely wonderful gardens with monitors walking around the lawns & a fantastic Orchid garden area.
"After having been to Singapore's Gardens By The Bay I thought nothing could equal what I saw. But when we visited the Singapore Botanic Gardens I knew that it was impossible to choose between one or the other. The gardens are immensely vast with the most astonishingly tall, old trees...every tree is labeled...what a labour of love! The entire area is open to access by all which is such a blessing for families. Only the Orchid Garden has a ticketed entrance.The entrance has a spectacular clock tower covered all over by tastefully selected orchid plants, matched and contrasted in colour and kind. There are little pergolas laden with hanging orchids, small enclosures with tastefully landscaped trees, rocks, pools, and waterfalls, from which the richness of orchid colours burst forth, leaving one speechless at their beauty. There is a celebrity garden featuring orchids named after famous men and women, and another which displays the orchids created by famous botanists. One can appreciate the meticulous care taken to maintain the ""display"" and the ""back up"" fields of flowering orchid plants awaiting their turn. The whole concept is to be greatly admired and I feel grateful for the opportunity of seeing so much natural splendour!"
Absolutely stunning garden. Anyone that goes to Singapore it is a must see. We suggest staying for night as the lights are beautiful.
Feel the fresh air and enjoy the unique properties while you 'exercise' walks around city forest. Take your camera and shot the beatiful scenery.
Nice and cozy scenery. A place to relax with lots of different plants. Orchard nursery a must see site. There is also a pond with Swan swimming around. Catch the right timing and you might be able to see performances on stage. No entrance fee except for the orchard nursery.
"We went by a metro line to the northern side of the Botanic Gardens and strolled down to its opposite side. It was a very nice and calm walk through the green flora, majestic trees and variety of flowers. We were surprised by a few rainfalls - typical for Singapore - but could hide in a few shelters that were located in the clean and well tended gardens. I can recommend to visit these places and perceive a different perspective of the modern city of Singapore."
Interesting and nice place in the city. As with all Singapore the walkways and cemented making it feel like a human rather than nature experience. Huge area and different gardens show different plants. Was very busy so you will not be alone.
This place is so beautiful. Well kept and taken care off. It's worth the visit. Great place to take pictures. I simply loved it.
"My friends and I look forward to enjoying relaxing morning walks around this garden which is so centrally located. This morning, we walked from the Napier Gate towards the lakes near the MRT station side. The round walk was 8000 steps and we loved the Begonia section, the many exercise groups, the serene white swans, the orchestra area, the ginger heliconia garden, the band stand, and the beautiful majestic old trees there. We were greeted by the crowing of cockrels, and many butterflies flirting around the flowers. Truly a delightful walk in the park!"
"This Garden suits people of All Ages! People come here for exercises and even wedding photo shoots. Can reach by bus or MRT trains due to the different gate locations. A day is not enough for you to enjoy the vast greenery, which makes you want to come back again. Is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
Try and pick a not so humid day to visit. Or perhaps a time when it is less likely to thunder storm. We had both which made the visit slightly more tricky. But we loved it.
"Really good decoration and peaceful: from fish feeding at the pond to swan lake, from Orchid Garden to Rain Forest we found every place to be immaculate and detailed.Would recommend to anyone who want to find plants attractive, enjoy moments of silence amidst nature refreshing."
"Beautiful Botanic Gardens despite the heat in Singapore. We only managed to visit half the gardens, as we spent so much time in the Orchid Garden. Will need to do the other half next time we are in Singapore!"
Beautiful and clean garden. With beautiful flowers species and the environment is great for Picnic. Great place to relax.
"We visit this garden without high expectation, but proven we're wrong.The garden are well kept and clean, the wild animals there are not afraid of human, we can see wild chicken, bird, turtles, even big lizard.Great encounter experience for young children."
A great place to relax and enjoy a leisurely stroll among the trees and pathway. Good for a family outing.
"Orchids, greenery, freshness and humidity is here; lovely place for a few hours walking and enjoying."
"If you are doing the rounds in Singapore on the hop on bus you must hop off here. Just a real joy to walk around as long as it is not too hot and humid. Don't forget the water. The Orchids are amazing and just so many colours. But there is plenty more to see and a great place to see lots of relaxed folk and of course all the different plants. Loved to see all the different tourists enjoyng the outing and also lots of information and helpful staff. Whether you are a fan of gardens or not, this is just the place to be."
This is a lovely oasis just outside the bustling Singapore and visits on a hop on hop off bus. We strolled around a bit but it's too hot generally for strolling so we paid the $5 each and went into the Orchid GardenThis garden is fabulous with every orchid o display. In addition they even have hybrid orchids for famous or important people so plenty to seeNice stuff in the gift shop too
You have to pay a small amount to access the Orchid Garden but otherwise the Botanic Gardens are free and provide an oasis of calm in the City. A lovely way to while away a few hours. The Gardens are one of the numerous stops on the Hop on/Hop off Bus Tours.
"We spent a couple of hours meandering around the stunning gardens, such a relaxing way to spend some time. There's plenty to see and so many exotic flowers and plants. We also had a lovely lunch in one of the restaurants."
Wow! The last time I went to the Botanic Gardens was 20 over years ago! How things has changed...! Back then it wasn't a UNESCO World Heritage Site yet... My friend and I hiked for over 3 hours and we enjoyed every minute of it! A must see!
"Perhaps the biggest botanical gardens we have visited thus far on our travels; it took about 2 hours to walk from one side to the other, with stops for photos along the way; this can be difficult especially on hot days.The gardens are free to enter and maintained immaculately. We entered from the north at the 'Botanic Gardens Station' bus stop. There are free, detailed maps to use available here.There is a huge array of flowers and wildlife, like the lake in the northern section which housed black swans and turtles. We also visited the Orchid Gardens which is a paid attraction, however we got in free with student cards (I'm not sure how as I thought there was still a charge for students). This was also enjoyable and at least worth a couple of SGD to see. We left the gardens via the south gate to 'Singapore Botanic Gardens' bus stop.In summary, the variety of plants and the information available makes this attraction stand out, and makes it worthy of recommendation."
beautiful gardens to stroll around and great place to take lots of pictures and I like the photo signs for taking the best shots. Singapore has done well in the upkeep of the gardens
It is nice place to visit if you are in Singapore and have time but Would recommend the cloud forest and garden by the bay first and then this.
"This is a beautiful garden. Would have been even better enjoyable, if not for hot & humid singapore weather (90+ F and humidity)"
"These gardens are vast with a huge variety of plants, trees and open spaces where events even take place. Take a hike up into the rainforest or visit the beautiful orchid gardens. The choice is yours. A tip, take a sunshade or umbrella to stave off the fierce sun and be prepared for the debilitating humidity. There are watering holes though. From the cafe serving a life saving lime drink or appetising pizza to full blown restaurants. The choice is yours. You'll need at least a couple of hours. Taxis are very reasonable and on leaving go to the taxi rank, ring the bell on the board and a passing taxi will see the lit sign on the main road and come to your aid. Another tip, it's illegal for taxis to overcharge, same rate day, night even NYE early hours. And ask for a receipt so that if you accidentally leave something in the taxi it can immediately be traced."
Walk around this fabulous garden. Take water and enjoy the different zones. Clean toilets. Places to sit and rest. Look out for performances that might be on. Ask for assistance if you need it some golf trolley type of vehicles they drive. Less razzle dazzle than gardens by the bay. Great plants beautiful setting. Great for garden lovers but space for kids to run. Education zone.
it is kind of an archaeological site with huge trees . a very vast expanse of land to see .lots of greenery and need to do a lot of walking
Must see when in Singapore. It can be challenging in humid conditions but definitely worth the effort.
"Also known as Kebun Bunga Singapura and city's first UNESCO World Heritage site. Great place for a walk especially not weekends coz it's less crowd/people so you can enjoy more the place and less noise. You'll definitely will see interesting plants or trees and flowers around including animals. No entrance fee, most recommended to bring your own food and drinks and the shops there can be very expensive. Bring some extra clothes to change incase you get wet due to the hot weather and umbrella/raincoats incase it rains."
This is a good place to go for an evening jog or for a walk or just to see and smell the scent of the various types of flowers. Definitely this is a place for people from all walks of life.
"Lot of nature and free entry. Be aware that Google map might not show you the best way there, so double check."
"Most beautiful orchids I have seen; thanks to the climate. Great walking and jobbing paths. Also, great for picnics if you can manage the humidity."
"We spent a few hours wondering around the gardens and loved spotting the wildlife, very nice relaxing time"
"Visited the latest attraction at Singapore Botanic Gardens Gallop Extension. Though only partially open, the free 1-hour guided tour of the place was really educational and insightful. I learned the importance of plants in our eco-system and details of trees used as timber to build houses and furniture. Worth visiting as a local or tourist"
It is easy to spend half a day walking around the garden and enjoying the views. It is very beautiful botanic garden. Do not forget comfortable shoes and water.
"A great place to bring young children to learn more about preserving our heritage and natural environment ... my grandchildren were totally awed by the vast greenery (after all, what they see most of time are concrete buildings); fascinated by the variety of orchid species, the beautiful swans swimming in the lake & just enjoying picnic-ing on the ground ï¸"
"Every major city of rank also has a grand park of great importance; London has its Hyde Park, New York's Central Park .. and Singapore has its Botanical Garden, which is very large, lush, well-kept and exciting, as it contains so many different parts - from real jungle to botanically planted garden in English style. Here I was able to empty my big city lungs and get a lot of peace of mind - fantastic scenery to photograph and miles with lovely walkways to explore. Well worth a (long) visit!"
"Singapore can be very proud of their Botanical gardens. They are huge in area but easy to walk through. The gardens have hundreds of flowers and plants that are laid out in areas of type and origin. It is so relaxing to walk through the gardens finding birds, squirrels. monitors, swans and turtles. The National Orchid house is also a must see. For a small entrance fee, in our case $1.00 for seniors, you'll find an amazing array of orchids of all size, shape and colours. These gardens were so good we went back for a second look."
"Well laid out gardens with plenty of shade from the sun but be prepared for the long walks in the humid conditions. Signposting is a bit confusing at times and could be better. Check out the National Orchid centre located in the gardens, lots of different Orchids on display."
I came early in the morning and it was already sweltering outside. This put a damper on my desire to see more of the Gardens. But well worth a visit if it's a little cooler outside.
We are frequent visitors to botanical gardens all over the world and had read a lot fantastic reviews about this one. So expectations were high and therefore we were a bitsurprised about the absence of brghtly coloured flowers. It is all very lush and green though but more of a rainforest than a garden. The orchid garden is very well done but a bit to over manicured for our taste (photo spots all over the place to make selfies)
These gardens are an amazing place to walk around. Plenty of shade. We started at North entrance by the Botanic Gardens MRT station and walked across the park to exit at Tanglin Gate to catch a bus back to the city. Plenty of variety to see with different themes.
"A very beautiful place to visit, allow at least half a day (or more) as there is plenty to see. The MRT is very convenient, and National Orchid garden and the ginger garden were great. There are a number of cafes and restaurants to choose from."
"very near the MRT station so easy to get there.very big park, bring your drink bottle and hat or umbrella. you can go picnic there under the shades of trees or just relax on benches all around the park. lots of great corner to relax. there are restaurants inside the botanical.. so if you want to have breakfast or lunch you can be early because its kinda full, but not that full.lots of mini lakes ... pathways.. and some art installation depend on the occation"
Orchid Garden is absolutely a paradise for flowers lovers.The ticket price is cheap and worth to pay.My most favorite spot is the House of VIPs Orchids.
Don't miss the bonsai garden! You can walk from one side of gardens and get a taxi on the other side.
"Frankly, I am not a gardener, but I am still stunned by all the beautiful orchids everywhere. Subtle differences as well as contrasts made a visual feast. Unfortunately, we only had limited time as this was a stop over on a group tour. Perhaps, can come again next time."
The Gardens are beautiful and well maintained. We spent a short time here as it was part of the half day city tour. Make a point of visiting especially if you love orchids!
It's a very pleasant place to walk. The best environment n very green. I have been there several times. Definitely will go whenever I have the chance to do it. A very refreshing place.
The 160-year-old Singapore Botanic Gardens is a star visitor attraction for the sophisticated traveller and the v world and is a unique example of the informal English Landscape Movement's style in an equatorial climate.
"Perfect place to relax, long walk and at the same time learning about vegetation. Especially if you have kids, The collection of orchid are amazing."
"An amazing UNESCO world heritage site this place is,absolutely amazing there is an entry fee to the garden. The garden also has an orchid garden free to seniors and locals"
"Well placed at the end of orchard road.Really worth a visit , beautiful flowers and plants in a wonderful garden, $5 to get in to this wonder."
"Nice place to cruise around, well-maintained garden, cool wildlife around the ponds and garden. Not I would specifically make a trip specifically to go there, but its not far from Orchard Rd and worth seeing if youre around."
Huge and beautiful gardens. We spent half a day here and were exhausted at the end. Took star off for rather limited information about various plants.
Explore the new extension. The Forest walk very refreshing but only partial ready. Overall the Botanical Garden is tranquil and good place to walk and feel the greenery around.
"After a long journey and midnight arrival into Singapore, this was just the recover I needed. Only 15 minutes walk from the Hilton Singapore, it is a massive expanse of gardens, lakes, secluded walks, and scenery. A great way to stretch the legs. Several restaurants and visitor centers are also there."
"Singapore botanic garden is huge! You can spend hours here and it's super beautiful. If you want to go inside National orchid garden, they open at 8.30am and the ticket is 5$"
"Wide variety of plants to be found here. Flowering and non-flowering. Ponds, learning forests, birds, musical performances at the right time. High end eating places within the garden itself. A favourite for people who enjoy early morning exercises, be it walking or jogging. Good for picnics too. Definitely a great place for a family romp in the park."
"This is a big area in which you can get lost. There are no bike riders allows in the gardens, which is a shame as distances stretch out and it seems almost to far to see it all by foot. Used to do Yoga at Eco Lake and we had turtles and chickens crossing our yoga mats at the rare occasion. To my disappointment the air conditioned orchid house is closed as this was the major attraction. You still have to pay $5 the get into the orchid garden though just to be outdoors. There are also restaurants and snackbars for refreshments. Make sure to wear mozzy protective spray and a hat or umbrella as most areas are uncovered."
The Gardens have a significant place among such Gardens in the World. A surprisingly open and varied display of plants and featuring the Far East obviously in particular
Really nice place to spend a couple of hours wandering around the gardens enjoying the sights. It's a no charge attraction which is amazing and would recommend for anyone wanting to recharge and breath fresh air for a day. Suitable for wheelchair users too. Great attraction.
"Orchid house a highlight, flowers beautifully done. Our children would probably been a little bored as the gardens themselves was very much like any other city & used for jogging, events, whatever. We parents enjoyed a stroll through though."
This place is to us way bigger than expected - but beautiful and nice with unbelievable number of different gardens and by that different impressions. Clearly worth a visit......and don't forget to visit also the amazing orchid garden....WAOW
"Was a lovely morning stroll through the garden, not a lot of colour but very green. It was nice to see some older ladies exercising.The National Orchid Garden was what I really came for, $5 admission, it was well worth it with so much colour, amazing.We didn't see all of the Botanical Gardens because it's just so big and my tired aching feet just wouldn't allow it lol."
"The area is very large for just half day to discover. Orchid Garden is very colorful, but i think they should increase more kinds of wild orchid for more rich and varied scenery. It's worth to come and enjoy. Ticket for this is only 5SGD"
My husband and I spent the morning walking around the Botanic Gardens and were pleasantly surprised the entry was free with an option to make an online donation. There are some mosquitos so wear insect repellent to avoid getting bitten.
"We explored all over the Singapore Botanic Gardens .. 160-year-old tropical garden located at the fringe of Orchard Road .. bordered by Holland Road & Napier Road to the south, Cluny Road to the east, Tyersall Avenue, Cluny Park Road to the west & Bukit Timah Road to the north. .... a world-class botanic gdn, honoured as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ...There is a beautiful & serene lake tt sits strategically in the midst of the tropical rainforest .. We also got a glimpse into some of the inhabitants tt has made this natural 82 hectares green playgrd their home ..In 2013, it was ranked as Asia's top park attraction .."
This is really an experience I would advise not to miss and specially dont miss the orchid gardens.Its so beautiful. Walking around makes you so at easy and tranquil ypu will forgetvtime.The flowers they grow are magnificent. The park is beautiful kept.
My husband and i are nature lovers. The more plants and flowers the better. So we enjoyed our trip to botanic gardens. Orkideh garden was beautiful but we enjoyed other part much more. Specially the waterfall.
We reached the gardens by the ho-ho bus. They were really lovely and definitely worth the visit. The orchid garden was probably the highlight of our visit.
We really enjoyed a Sunday strolling through the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The highlights were the National Orchid Garden and the refreshing mint lemonade at the Bees Knees Cafe.
.I especially loved the crystal amethyst geodes and stalagmitesOr more in the surrounding parks if you choose. The garden is big and beautiful with lots of floral and fauna
"The Botanic Gardens covers an expansive area, almost impossible to walk through completely in one go, great weekend picnic spot, free of charge!!"
"We spent a nice afternoon walking around the Botanic gardens, which are extremely huge and have a variety of mini gardens on offer to look at. Whilst you have to pay to get into the special Orchid Garden, the main Botanic Garden is free for all.Visitors may want to see if there will be any performance on stage in the middle of the Garden, as it is a great atmosphere and worthwhile to stay. We had the pleasure to listen to Singapore Uni's orchestra perform free of charge for us.The only downside is that additionally to the humid and hot climate of Singapore, the trees and the mini lakes add an extra humidity to the air, which makes it quite exhausting to walk around. Have plenty of water with you - but don't worry there's plenty of shops located inside should you run out. It's also easy to find, as it is directly outside the station 'Botanical Gardens'.The only thing that I would have wished for was a bit more colours and ease to find your way, but maybe that's just me :)"
"Lovely, well tended gardens. Opportunity to see uncommon species of trees: plants etc. Easy to navigate, not too big, nice restaurant."
It's really worth it but it's so big. You need at list 5 hours to go around. You restaurant s if you are hungry. We loved it.
"We took the MRT tothe gardens, which means ou enter at the opposite end to the Orchid garden giving you a chance to walk through a large part of the grounds. This takes you past various groves of plants and a couple of lakes. It's not the most spectacular gardens I've visited but we saw some wildlife including a few large monitor lizards and lots of butterflies. Our primary aim was the Orchid Garden, so we didn't deviate far off the main path there.The Orchid Gardens however are amazing and well worth the effort. You pay to enter, unlike the main gardens, which are free. There are various eateries within the park and smaller outlets for drinks which is useful in the hot climate. People were also picnicing."
"Didn't spend a lot of time in the actual Botanic Gardens but spent most of the day in the National Orchid Gardens which are spectacularly beautiful. Would definitely recommend the Orchid Garden, loved the colours & shapes, the whole lay-out of the place & the way the orchids are displayed. A great idea that they have 'photo spots' where they recommend visitors taking photos of themselves with the orchid displays as a backdrop. It's wonderful, well worth a visit."
One of the best place to have a walk and relax in the busy city of singapore. There are events held at different times of the year and mostly are free. Great to just go for a picnic when the sun is setting.
"Absolutely lovely, you can take a picnic and sit amongst the beautiful gardens. You can spend the whole day here if you wish."
"Nice way to spend a few hoursWe cycled here, and found out when we arrived that no bikes are allowed in the park.There were plenty of spaces allocated for bike parking though.There was a small section where sellers were selling plants, a small gift shop and a cafe near the entrance.You can also see Stamford Raffles original residence and also the Corner house, named after Charles Corner the botanist who used to curate the gardensThere is an open air auditorium that seems to host a number of events, so if visiting Singapore it could be worthwhile checking their schedule, we noted that we missed out on Beethoven the night before.Gardens are well kept, and established, with a good amount of information about each area posted, and there are also enough shady paths to keep you out of the direct heatWell worth the visit, a quick escape to peace and quiet."
"We caught the MRT to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. The station was right at one of the entrances to the gardens. We walked past beautiful and colourful bougainvilleas, where seats allowed us to relax and take in the beautiful space. There was a foliage and trellis garden nearby. As the season had been dry the central lake did not have a lot of water in it.It was 1km or so to the many other popular parts of the gardens but as it was hot and humid and our time was short, we decided to do visit those areas at another date. Maps and brochures with walking trails were available and recycling these maps was actively encouraged."
"We were excited about the opportunity to see the gardens. Things started out very well as we explored the ginger garden, orchid garden, and amphitheater area. But then we spent 30 minutes trying to locate the other areas like the healing garden and the fragrant garden. We tried following the maps and posted signage and we are actually very good at following maps and directions. The posted signage is either inadequate or misleading and the printed map was not helpful. We did try asking employees for directions and were misdirected twice. So we just gave up and left. We really did enjoy what we saw of the gardens, but left frustrated."
"It is a very big botanical garden, in fact too big for 1 day tourist visit.Nice to see, many impressions.Long distances !No inside transport witnessed.Take your time and rest at Halia restaurant, good menu options"
good place to visit for photos.if bringing pets please leash pets or fines will be imposed by NPARKS
"Amazing area to go for a walk, whether this be Morning, Afternoon or Night!People need to add this to their to do list in Singapore!"
We decided to check out the Botanic Gardens because we could. They are really lovely and we found that they are used a lot by the locals for picnics etc on the weekend. There are lots of little spots to set up in for the day beside little man made creeks etc and under shade. We enjoyed our walk through here. There are also the Orchard Gardens to see as well.
"Came here for a picnic with my friends. Location is public and green. However, not the best for wet weather."
"This is a beautiful garden, no doubt about it. Lots of paths, well laid out. Wonderful collection, such variety. The National Orchid Garden inside the botanic garden is stupendous. There are marked paths for wheelchair accessibility. This place is huge. Yet, there are no wheelchairs and no mobility scooters for rent. No golf carts to help the less able but not wheelchair bound to get to the highlights or to the orchid garden. No little train. Nothing. If you arrive by MRT Botanic Garden it is nearly a mile to the orchids and not that much shorter from MRT Napier. If you have walking issues, arrive by taxi to the orchid garden car park to make it a much shorter walk to the orchids and know that you will miss the rest of this place because there is no assistance."
"If you're desperately looking for something green, but can't get to the treetop walk, this is it. The gardens are nice, and I'm sure if you walk the whole thing, pretty big and varied. But it's hot and the 'smell garden' consisted of like 5 things. The museum part is interesting, but again short and not much there. The surrounding area is, shocking, lots of malls and restaurants not open for lunch."
"The gardens are lovely but do not follow the map that is available. It is not arranged well. I tried to follow the map to see everything but was walking in circles and missed some areas. The gardens are large, a gift shop is available near the ginger garden and a second one near an exit."
Nice visit but can be very hot between 12 and 3. Make sure to use insect repellant. Directions within the botanics gardens could be improved and sometimes it seems you are being directed via the longest route. Restaurants are ok in the garden. On Sunday there are usually free concerts.
"I'd recommend going on a weekday if you want a quieter time. It's a lovely place but at times it felt just as rushed as city life. I enjoyed my time at Gardens by the Bay much more.If you do visit the Botanic Gardens, check out the Evolution Garden. That was my favorite section."
"I live right by the botanic garden, and I go there on a weekly basis to walk etc, and to be honest, it's a beautiful and serene place, but all the best places like the orchid gardens require an entrance fee, and many times season changes effect the flora. Getting around is another hassle, and the bugs and mosquitoes are the worst here, especially by the lakes/ponds. It's great during the spring and summer months, not so much during the winter."
Stage was set with good emcees and musicians who were serious to share their music. Conductor attempted to get crowd to participate but perhaps physical distance from stage to audience was too far to coordinate.
"If you are looking for a Botanic Garden, go to the Gardens by the Bay (free for the extensive outside gardens). The indoor gardens are outstanding but not free."
The big difference between many botanical gardens you may visit is the multitude of orchid species you can see.Recommend you visit it of you are interested in orchids
"We'd saved the botanic gardens for our last day in Singapore, but ended up leaving after 30 minutes. It was just too hot to walk around and enjoy them. A shame!"
"The gardens are massive, so make sure to grab a map. It's hard to spend a lot of time here because of the heat. Some water fountains are available. All the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. It's nice that the gardens are free to the public. As a Student Pass holder I thought the Orchid Garden would cost $1, but I got in for free! It's worth a visit if you have spare time in Singapore."
"Singapore Botanic Gardens:- Place to relax- Nothing special to see- Pay 6 SGD to visit Orchid Garden, free for children under 12 years of age- Very large"
If you going by MRT or Bus better prepare for minerals water. I walk over then 5km to going there. But excited when I arrive.
"I think the garden is nice, especially orchid garden and the rain forest. However, if you are short on time I will definitely recommend that you go to gardens by the bay instead!"
"There are some fantastic parts like chickens living there. They simply just walk around and are super friendly. Ponds and lakes had massive numbers of turtles and otter sightings were common for us. But when it came to the gardens I was expecting more. Don't get me wrong, the gardens were lush and green and super enjoyable to walk around through but there weren't many flowers and plants with more interesting features. There were heaps of facilities like grass areas, gazebos, cute undercover house type things, toilets, a restaurant and a kids section but something was missing. The kids area (that we did wander around in) made me feel like kids wouldn't enjoy it. I mean, there's a playground and fun little ponds but I can't imagine kids being interested in anything but those few facilities. That's just my opinion but the whole vibe is awesome and personally I thought it was average but definitely cool in its own way."
If you are up for a good walk in nature then this would be the place for you. But please ensure the weather is in your favour before heading there.
Dropped by for an evening stroll. Unfortunately singapore's weather is too humid still in the evening to be pleasant. And too dark to see much. There's a new section called the keppel discovery wetlands with a skybridge
Lots of great walking here in a beautiful setting. Huge place worth spending time. Recommend 2hrs + to walk through- could spend more time.
Good for one time and first time visitors not for people who have already seen such gardens else where especially in Europe and USA
"Nice place to visit. Lots of variety of plants, trees, shrub and many many more. Visiting here is perfectly fine in humid hot weather."
The Gardens were ok.It was easy to get to with the MRT just go Botanic Gardens stop and it takes you to the park enterance. Sadley not a lot of food choices around the gardens. I went near lunch time and hoped there be shops in the street at the enterance there weren't many.Theres a $5 entry fee for Orchard Gardens which I refused to pay.The Garden's were nice and there were different areas with different themes.With the humidity and heat and the amount of walking more water taps would have been beneficial. There are maps and customer service people around the park. Other wise well maintained gardens worth the visit.
Kindly visit only if you plan or interested in some research and just roaming in the gardens. Nothing much to see.
"Now a UNESCO Worlpd Heritage Site, SBG was set up in 1859 by Lawrence Niven, an Englishman. The Garden thus bears the style signature of an English garden.Over the years SBG has grown in different directions and continued to be a Regional Center for Plant Science Research & Conservation in SE Asia. It's an excellent piece of Urban Jungle.With over 4 million footfalls every year, SBG is one of the most popular Botanical Gardens in the World."
"It is definitely one of the oldest garden Singapore have created. The running track is mix of hills, slopes and flat surface.Rich with many beautiful trees and plants that has been maintain well by town council. For avid Yoga or TRX practitioner, you have few concrete gazebo overlooking beautiful scenery for you to do these activities.The only dampener, is after sunset, this whole garden is quite poorly lit and the signage in and out of the garden can be confusing.I'm giving 3 star, because they have a beautiful small pond at the edge of this garden but quite poorly maintained. That's the only negative point. Rest are perfect for city folks after office hour or business travelers in the area to sweat out and have fun.Foreign guests would be pleasantly surprised on how Singapore maintains such a dense and lush garden at the start of famous Orchard Belt."
"Unless necessary, I probably would not go again. Just a huge ass garden for people to have picnic at, chill and play with their kids. Well, it can be suitable for photoshoot as well. Just remember to bring you own food or grab your meal at the cafes/eateries nearby (Very limited selection). Nothing much to see there if you are looking for interesting/fun things."
Enjoyed the ride to get to the botanical gardens but once of the figeler the walking is mostly hill climbing or down hill but the trees and all carefully named amazing agapathanis and yucca in full bloom and other plants now play ground for children is so wonderful .It is the heat and humidity that is a problem . Best to choose the correct time of day to explore the gardens .
There are not many sheltered areas away from the sun here and unless you are combining this visit with a trip to the Orchid Gardens there is not a great deal of things to interest most people.
Great for gardeners who would like to grow these tropical plants. Orchid garden slightly disappointing and as they were magnificent but grown in clumps among the greenery I had expected more colourful plants but it was still worth $2 per couple!!
I underestimated this place for its size. Ik took me and my friend about 2 hours to get from the MRT station to the other side woth a lake. O recommend this place of you have a lot of time and you like nature.
We tried to make it here to capture some photos. Was very disappointed because half was closed for renovations but we still had to pay the full price. It was a very uninspiring garden with hardly any color. Also the garden workers couldn't stop staring at my girlfriend. They were all looking at her and watching her without any self control. I know she pretty but is super unprofessional!
Nice small botanical garden. This is a well designed garden to spend your free time with friends and family. This garden not a big one as compared to other places I have been.
My family resides in Singapore and found this place is indeed a good place to visit as it is full of nicely keep flora and fiona....
On the places to see in Singapore is the gardens a great display of many plant varieties from all over the World on show in all their glory. It is truly amazing what has been done by the Management and Staff you will not be disappointed with what you see.
"This was a beautiful attraction and had many varieties of vegetation.However, like many attractions in Singapore, there is a lot of walking required, and some of the paths are a bit steep, the later the day the more uncomfortable this becomes.Several sections of the garden last are pretty much just a park and not very note worthy."
"I have visited a few botanical garden before namely Penang Botanical Garden, Melbourne botanical garden and Perth Botanical Garden. Comparing the SG botanical garden with the rest of the botanical garden I visited before, the size is as big as the one in Melbourne. However, the trees and the flowers are quite distant apart from each others as compared to the one in Melbourne. That's also mean that some areas in the garden don't have any plants that worth to see. There is a lake inside the garden with a swan in it. There are plenty of picnic area in the garden as compared to other botanical gardens."
Free to enter. It'll take for more than hour to look around all area. Large garden. Rain forest area and frogs & snakes area were interesting. There weren't enough places to avoid heavy sudden rain.
i was not too impressed by this botanical gardens. gardens of the bay was much better than this. and not much staff around for guidance
We spent a couple of hours wandering around the gardens on a hot Monday Morning- killing time before our flight back to London .We just went with the flow and ended up at the lovely Orchid Garden - which had a small entrance fee of 5 dollars.We've been to Singapore on many occasions but never visited the gardens as to be honest it was pretty low on our list of things to do - however we are glad to have now experienced it .Would recommend- but there are other attractions much more interesting - Gardens by the Bay !Do if you have a spare couple of hours and go with low expectations - it's not Kew Gardens .
"This was the one place friends recommended. Although nice and pleasant to walk round was disappointed by poor (and in the main) labelling of plants and trees.most labelling that did exist was rather old and often just the Latin name. The Evolution garden particularly disappointing. We went in at the wrong end, which could have been avoided with better signage. There's a general timeline at the entrance plus a couple of descriptive boards later, but that's it. Definitely not a description of how the evolutionary process worked, could have been so much better.Good if you like Orchids but again a but more description of how the grew in their natural habitat would have added to the experience"
"Seen one botanical garden yourve seen the all, there are lots of runners and yapping dogs when we walked around so it wasn't pleasant, the gardens are nice but not much else to see or do, so of the flowers were nice PS watch where you step"
"We visited as it was close by to our hotel and it is a world heritage sight. We decided to walk around in the heat of the day, maximum humidity but the gardens are lovely, lots of places to walk and lots of things to see if you like parks. I was uncomfortable with the heat/ humidity but on a cooler day, it would have been a lovely place to walk and chillax. Well worth a visit."
very boring place.Do not recommend to come here if you are a tourist.Instead go to East coast park which has more things to do such as renting a bicycle/seeing ships being docked/good hawker food
Nice place to visit. Went as part of resort/ cruise. Spent 3 days in Singapore and then cruise to Thailand and Malaysia returned 7 days later. Quite hectic but worth it
Visited the gardens. Was expecting something spectacular and it wasn't. Just like a park with more exotic plants and trees. Lots of walking. Great for a picnic.
"Just an ordinary pretty park where people come to relax on weekends, where some pre-wedding photoshoots are taken. Won't give you a new experience as it is just a park! can skip if you r short on time!"
"I must admit, I was a bit disappointed with the Botanic Gardens. Having read that it was one of the must visit places in Singapore, my wife and made sure it was on our list of places to visit. It was nice to walk around the park, but I was expecting it to be more spectacular. The Orchid Gardens was very pretty, but I would not rush to visit again."
"Not many flowers to see. But Nice for strolls and jogs though. Anytime, a good place to rest eyes on greenery."
"We had a nice walk through the gardens, but really it didn't seem that special. A lot of the gardens are in an open area. The Orchid Gardens were very good, and I've left a separate review for them."
Drop by to botanical garden after breakfast in the area.Very convenient with the SMRT station just outside the garden entrance.It is a very popular location and was very crowded.The plants and tree are well labelled and well placed. The park is also well organised with signage showing the locations of key exhibit and amenities.There are some renovation and upgrade on-going currently
"It's a really pretty,easy, clean place it's a good half day or a few hours trip. You roam around the gardens and see all these amazing flowers and fruits, after enjoy a soft drink from 'ginger garden' very cool , safe place."
"Gardens are nice but disappointing after going to gardens by the bay as they were amazing, so maybe visit botanic gardens first"
Try to avoid during weekends n also too humid. Nothing compare to Hyde park in London and visitors tend to be very 'rushing' & uncaring
Take a look around this garden if you are around orchard area. Mins walk to this garden.But prepare bug repellent spray.
Nice visit in this huge park...We were very impressed by the orchids...if you pay attention you can see some birds of prey flying and carps in the ponds.
To get relief from these high rise buildings one should visit botanic gardens which is located in city centre but maintaining nature harmony.
Great place to visit. Require one day to explore. Very good informative on tree. Well maintained. Very good connectivity through metro rail to whole Singapore.
"After walking around garden by the bay, i was totally exhausted. So it may not be fair to give a review for this garden. But parts of pay gardens(Sï¼5) was closed & the orchid garden that i was so keen to see was not as impressive as i thought it would be. Wear a hat, sunglasses and sunscreen. There are cafes & benches. Give yourself time to rest a lot."
visiting to this place overall experienced was ok however when watching the concert at amphitheater was pretty warm. having a cooler environment would be a plus.
"The Botanic Gardens have been around for decades and over time there have been new additions to facilities so the facilities are in good condition.However the landscaping and maintenance could do with some improvement, and enhancements to its natural beauty could be added. After all, the plants are the reason why we go there!"
"It's well maintained, very pretty. We Australians have been spoiled by all the nature wonders and great beaches, so this is nothing new to us."
"I came here and was quite annoyed by fact that in the flower dome, there were very little flowers! My visit was during Chinese New Year, so the place was covered with decorations for Chinese New Year. Which was understandable but if it's a flower dome shouldn't there be lots of flowers?Rest of the trip was berg pleasant and nice.If you haven't visited the place, I wont spoil the experience for you. This place is a must-see if you come to Singapore."
It was easy to find and a very peaceful experience with lots to see and do. Go on a nice day weather wise and you will enjoy it.
It's one of those things to put on your itinerary if you want to avoid expensive attractions. It's definitely not world class but somewhere to go for exercise.
Though it's free there is not really much there of major interest. Lovely setting and immaculate as usual for SG but I was in and out in 20 mins as it was so hot and humid.
In my opinion the Botanic Garden it self is not that exciting. There are mainly green/ brown plants and not very much flowers. The best part of the Botanic Garden is the Orchid Garden.
"Some advice, go really early, or on a cool day.Really lush, expansive grounds. Really nice for those into botany. I'm not so was kind of wasted on me. But even I could appreciate how huge and beautiful this place is!"
We had a really interesting time here. It was reasonably easy to walk around and lots to see. I think that if you're not too interested in plants etc it could be a wasted trip...do something else. Very hot and humid though as is all of Singapore.
"My biggest recommendation would be to visit this first THEN visit Gardens by the Bay. I came here after and found it underwhelming, which I really didn't think I would.The Botanical Gardens is much quieter than Gardens by the Bay which is flooded with tourist.I caught the MRT and explored for around an hour on the side closest to MRT, I didn't get to see the other side so maybe there is more to explore over there. I would have loved to have been able to see the Healing Gardens but it was quite a distance from the MRT station.Wear good walking shoes as there is a good distance to cover.Had breakfast at the Bees Knees Garage - awesome."
"While it is amazing that this place has quite alot of species (esp trees and plants , not so much of spices n herbs)in this Rainforest including the hard to spot - Monkey Pot, Sapucaia-nut trees, it has not much of other wow factorsU must set aside 1-2hours to explore the various areas of this gardens, from the cactus to the area on ginger (so good to explore from one gate to the other gate/exit)YOU have to be a nature lover or someone into gardening in order to appreciate this place and it is quiet and peaceful (good for books reading or simple picnic)It houses the National Orchid Garden which is worth a visit (pls see my review separately) and I noticed that travellors rate this gardens high due to the good scoring given to the Orchid Garden instead"
"Nice gardens, but not too interesting for kids. Our 8-year old liked the swanlake and the swinging benches, but she couldn't reallly appreciate the plants and trees. However, we would recommend this for people who visit without kids."
"I visited the Botanic Gardens as one half of the Marina Bay Gardens tour. It was incredible to be inside and be surrounded by so such a beautiful array of plant life, and so neatly organized at that! However, since I do not know much about flowers, I'm sure I didn't appreciate it as much as I could have. Definitely worth the visit though!"
"I'm fact, in my opinion, there is not do much to do and see. I would say whole city is touristic trap.So ""half a loaf is better thank no bread"".Do you can visit if you have too much time.Futuristic trees are nice. I liked idea. They aren't so big as you can think lookin' on Photoshop."
Last time I was here it was summer and the Botanic Garden was a riot of color. In February only the orchids are in bloom. The orchids are great but a little color elsewhere would have livened up the hot and humid 1 mile walk from the metro to the orchid garden.
"I got down from the MRT station and headed straight into the gardens. The orchid garden is reached after a 2kmwalk through the 'usual' garden.The sun was scorching which ruined half the fun. Nevertheless, we bought a ticket for the orchid garden. Some parts of it were under maintenance and since I'm not a fan of gardens, I didn't enjoy walking through the heat.So skip this if you aren't interested in different types of Flora. But if you DO go, try choosing a relatively cooler day."
"It is a heritage site. In the day, you can walk around the park and consider looking out for any free performances at the theatre. At night, the lighting makes some parts of the park look slightly mystical... it is otherwise free..."
"The entrance to the Botanical Garden is very near to the MRT Station. Unfortunately, we cannot finish all the places in the Garden as it is too big. We came around 9 am also, so the weather is quite hot. Overall, this place is relaxing and free."
We had a nice afternoon wandering around this garden but it lacked serendipity. It is a nicely designed garden but it didn't really have any special features or anything that made you go wow. It needs more colour and more creativity and thought in the design.
The gardens are free to enter but on a rainy day in January we were just sloshing along waterlogged paths looking at nothing very much - sadly there are no plant identification markers. The best bit is undoubtedly the orchid house for which there is an admission fee.
I took the free Saturday walking tour of the Medicinal garden. It had promise to be educational but the guide ended up reading the signs not sharing other information. There's a good food court near the Medicinal garden for refreshments. I visit alot of botanical gardens thus the average rating.
"The only heritage site in Singapore is the Botanic Gardens, it is easily accessible by either bus or MRT. The entrance to this place is free and the place is very big and divided into different section. We had a bad experience whereby we booked a valentine day dinner with Halia but due to night time we couldn't find the way and took us a while to find. I am not really a person that appreciate the plants and trees though, but during the day the place is very beautiful."
"These gardens are beautiful, well laid out and well maintained. However they are very extensive so staff travel around on golf buggy type vehicles and small commercial carts. They fly around, so keep your wits about you.If you are thinking of going into the Orchid Gardens note that several areas are closed pending development, including two houses (both) and the Bromeliad enclosure. There was no apparent warning of this before you bought your tickets and it was obviously a source of frustration for some visitors."
"As it was free entry to the orchid garden for Singaporean during the school holidays, my sister and I brought my mom to the botanic garden. We took bus and alighted at Gleneagles Hospital and walked in. We got to walk through the garden then reached the orchid garden. The orchids are really beautiful and gorgeous, my mom loves it. As some areas were having work in progress, we didn't get to see more as before. It will be very tiring to walk the whole garden, so it will be good to decide where you want to go."
Relaxing environment in a garden setting. Lush greenery. Big place so best to view map online on the many exits in this garden.
You can take a stroll here I wouldn't say it's a must see but if you have time it's a nice place to chill. You can see monitor lizards and feed fish in the pond
"This is not a flower garden. But you would find herbs and plants and trees some over 150 years old. Pales in comparison to Gardens by the Bay which is a recent attraction. However, a number of plants and trees are markers of a time when colonial powers rules Singapore and the British love of discovery and collectionnof plants. Most would just see this as a park and yes there are mosquitoes and wasps. If old llants and herbs are not your thing, give this place a miss."
"I had heard rave reviews about this and after other gardens in Singapore I had high expectations. It did not deliver. Was nice to walk through. Some steep inclines, still manageable if in mobility assist. Would be great for a family, couple, group to pack picnic and relax on the groups. Fair distance walk to transport (and at x1 point we did get lost trying to get out - signage didn't help) carparks a distance away as well. Put your walking shoes on and get active!"
Could skip it if on a tight schedule. Good place for nature lovers to please and revive their senses. A very good Souvenir collection.
"If you are a nature lover, this would be a great place to be.. there is a an Orchid Garden section, where one could see 1000s of hybrid species. Its a great way to spread nature awareness to general public. Its covers a big area, so take your time to go through the entire area."
"If this is your type of thing and you want to see all the different type of orchids, then this is worth a visit. There is a bit of walking and we went on a hot and humid day.We were tired, hot amd just wanted to get out of there."
"Nice park if you want to have a quiet place to visit and even a small picnic with the kids. This place is free to visit but you need to pay for orchid garden entrance. Worth a visit if you are orchid lover.There is an orchestra stadium in the middle of the garden, usually they have good orchestra at around 2pm or 5pm-6pm, depending on schedule. Feel free to check their website or google for schedules.Good place to relax with family. Watching the kids running around while sitting on grass and listening to orchestra symphony. Watch the weather too if you are going. Not a good place to go if it's raining."
A lot of walking with no transport options or supply of filtered water. Would like to see some advancements in moving around easier as walking up hills in humid conditions is not always part of a relaxing holiday.
"Hot and humid and sunny visit, it was crowded too on a Sunday.Didn't see the No Cycling sign either and was stopped by two unfriendly officers on a golf buggy - begged them for several minutes before they let me off with a stern warning.Otherwise nice free attraction to visit."
Great park for local resident. I would not call this an attraction for visitors. Only if you have too much time come spent a day picnic in the park.
"Disappointing. Really nothing special to see here, I have been to many different botanical gardens and this is one is average. Should be the last thing on your list of things to do in Singapore. At least it's free, except for orchids garden, which is 5$."
"A total waste of time for tourists.there nothing there except a huge garden.trees are are hardly visible ,not suitable for the hotn humid climate.ideal for localites who want to spend some open space(jogging etc)Nothing extra ordiniary,just walking & tiring yourself for nothing"
"UNESCO probably needed to designate a place in Singapore and chose this place but if you have travel to places in Central and South America, do not waste your time here, the only good thing is that it was free."
I have seen LOTS of botanic gardens. They are generally lush and packed with vegetation. This place sparce by comparison. Its a big park. It was so hot we couldn't reach the orchid thing. We had to turn back and go inside the subway to cool off.
"Good for walking and jogging,Not so recommended for kidsMust bring food if you are vegetarian and avoid rainy season"
The botanic gardens are a must see in Singapore. Easy to reach by MRT.There is a 5$fee to the orchid displays which were a highlight. Only 1$ for seniors.You could spend hours here just enjoying the gardens.Recommend going early to avoid the heat.Had a lovely pastry and coffee in their cafe.Lovely gift shop but pricey.
"If you are from an urban locale, sure visit. If you are Singaporean or here for an extended stay and have plenty of time to experience the city, sure visit. Otherwise, it just wasn't that special."
Nothing really spectacular in this garden but maybe it is because I am not a big fan of plants...I did learn few things like the tree on the 5 dollars note but that is about it.Maybe a good place for picnics but my son and I came back with rashes.Not sure I would go back...
Perhaps the botanic gardens were slightly disappointing because they have been so dramatically upstaged by the Gardens on the Bay. It was also disappointing to discover that there was a charge for entry to the orchid section.
It was nice. I can appreciate the effort they put in to the gardens. But they are not anything I can really write about. I would definitely go to gardens by the bay over this. I have been to beautiful botanical gardens over Australia and they are 10 times more exciting then the Singapore botanic gardens.
"It's just a botanic garden, nothing special about it. If something notable, it's its mediocrity. A waste of space in Singapore and a waste of my time. Came in the morning and left swiftly. Just out of my memory, the Flowers Garden in Shiraz, Iran, is far nicer than this huge but sterile space. It has a good thing: it's for free!"
Just went in to check but came out as I can't see anything impressive. Probably this is good for children.
It is an average place just about good enough for a lazy afternoon. Definitely not a must see if you are a tourist. This is more for residents who have seen all the other awesome things Singapore has to offer.
"I have seen many botanical gardens or nice parks around the world.And this is not the best one as many review said.It is surprising why this can be nominated as World Heritage while there is no real true historic nature and beauty on the site but artificial ones.I hope Singapore people visit other parks around the world to learn how to make such level of gardens.As many other parks, locals are really not good to maintain the site.Children's park items are constantly broken and man made pond/lake are smelly.Most of maintenance workers are not likely Singaporeans and cheap foreign labors which I do not feel good about it. If you proud of your garden, it should be taken full of care by locals...Still, lot of lawn spaces so it can be good place to gather big groups and do some picnic. However, Singapore park has BITING ANTS which really Bite your skin to the level it really hurts and make you jump. So, you have to be very very careful where you sit or touch. Other way, you end up with pains and crying children."
"We went to the Botanic Gardens in the hope to see a large variety of flora and fauna in a city that seemed to place pride in showcasing it's green-fingered nature.As a walk, it's pleasant enough and on a hot day, provided some nice scenery.Hoqever, there was not much to see and the orchid garden, for which there was a small fee, was very underwhelming.If you fancy a walk and have the time for it, then it might provide some benefit to you, otherwise worth skipping, especially the orchid garden!"
"Being a tourist in Singapoe, felt going to this botanic garden was waste and time consuming as it was just like another big botanic garden. This may be good for family picnic but not for a foreign tourist as there are many other good places in Singapore than this."
"Singapore Botanic Garden is a green and refreshing place in the city center, but too crowded on weekends."
I liked but it's not worth visiting compared to other sites in Singapore. The weather was very hot and couldn't enjoy walking
It might have something to do with the timing of when I went. It wasn't the most beautiful botanical garden that I have visited. It was very nature like but just not what I expected it to be.
"Although the park is big, I think there's nothing much inside. Just grass, trees, some benches.. Gardens by the bay is way much more nicer than this place."
"I really don't understand all of the great reviews on this place. If you grew up in a city where there are no green areas I can understand. But this place I would not classify as a botanical garden. It's really just a very nice park. And as for the Orchid Garden, I saw more orchids at Changi Airport than I saw in this ""garden."" And I'm not exaggerating. Just look at the Visitor Photos posted. You know what you see very little of? Flowers! Lots of green, and a few orchids. To me, this was a complete waste of time. Save some time and go to the Gardens by the Bay. Those were spectacular."
We accessed the botanical gardens using the city explorer. We walked through the gardens which were free and then paid a small charge to go into the orchid gardens.The orchid gardens had some beautiful examples of orchids and was a pleasent environment to stroll around in the sunshine.
My friends and I went there to get some fresh air. But unfortunately it was hot and no wind at all. The garden is beautiful and big. The path and the gazebo are great and well maintained.
"Very disappointed with this, Sure they are free but the signs and the map DO NOT match, it is very confusing to try and walk around. Many of the plants do not have labels and a couple of staff we asked had no idea . Food and water was EXTREMELY expensive at the central food 'stalls/restaurants' the items in the gift shops were very expensive and not value for money.The orchid garden there is no where except the at entrance that says it cost money to enter."
It's an old style garden with nothing great to see else the entry to orchid garden is through this only.
"Standard garden, explore some place not found interesting view, hot in the afternoon. You could try orchid garden but not free, will need you too pay."
"Its a huge garden , good for evening walk, but not a tourist attraction i would say. Reaching here is very easy, as there is an MRT station with the name of the garden and has exit right outside the entrance of the garden."
"we enjoyed our visit to Botanic gardens at Singapore. lush green , soothing to eyes and very pleasant to walk through to garden. Traveler to Singapore must plan a visit to garden."
"Botanic Gardens are a large area of lovely greens. The area needs a few hours to go through. Gardens are full of small roads you can walk on. But the distances are long and the air is so humid and hot (at least for a person coming from northern Europe)...Easy enough to visit with a stroller.Be sure to bring a cold bottle of water with you and shades, preferably also an umbrella. You can find shade her and there by the threes but still you will sweat a lot if you want to see the whole gardens.There are a few small ponds you can look at and some birds and even some statues to see but nothing special. Locals use this garden as a picnic place but to my taste (and my 1 year 2 months old kids taste) it was too much. In the restaurants also no air conditioning. But we saw a monkey (wuhuu said the kid!) and enjoyed a nice snack. Restrooms were ok.For me the highlight was the orchid gardens. Wonderful and I highly recommend it. Amazingly beautiful flowers in so many colours. Interestingly there were many orchids named after celebrities."
"While the gardens are huge and well maintained, I personally found them really boring. If you are someone who enjoys looking at plants this might be good for you. Paying to see the Orchid Garden was a complete waste"
"There is nothing special of tourist interest there, just average park. U can cross it in 15 mins. There are places to eat as anywhere in SG"
In my opinion this place is so peaceful and I really don't like it. The garden is so big. Ok for nature lovers. Not must go place for me. After all everybody has his/her own opinion.
"Since my first visit and last are more than 17 Years. Yes its now a place for People how need Sports activities. With the rest of the past, it's over. Sorry"
"Remember Singapore is sunny and hot. The Gardens do not provide much shade. And it is a long walk to the Orchid Garden from the underground station entrance. On the whole, the visit could turn out to be very tiring and uncomfortable. Not recommended for the weak and those who do not like heat. The Gardens should consider providing some form of internal transport. Unless you are really interested in plants and treat this as an educational rather than leisure visit, it is probably not worth the effort.Since it would be another long walk to the underground station entrance after visiting the Orchid Garden, the visitor will likely leave by the exit at the other end. There is no underground station there. You have to rely on buses or taxi but the latter is never easy to find on the road."
"We literally got lost in these gigantic gardens even with a map. The maps look inaccurate, the paths are poorly signposted and confusing. If you plan to visit, stick to the side that is near the orchid garden and stay on the crowded paths. If you dare to venture off to the further away areas, bring a hat, plenty of water and if you have one a GPS map. I've attached a photo of what to expect with the signs, notice the confusing information. The maps are useless, they don't match the grounds. Beautiful place but those free maps needs to be looked at."
Well worth a visit and very accessible by public transport (MRT). Not expensive admission.There are activities including the water park at the Jacob Ballas Children's Garden. But the real highlight is the National Orchid Garden which is world class and also of interest to kids. Don't miss the Celebrity Orchid Garden section. The Gardens are large and it's a tall order to see all of the Botanic Gardens in one day. There are very good picnic opportunities at this part of the gardens and better chances of a breeze. The gardens are very wheelchair accessible.
"I don't get what all the hype is about, and let me tell you... I LOVE FLOWERS AND TREES. Like, I love them.Its a nice park space with trails and interesting trees yes, but a stop for tourists, no. I wouldn't go back."
"I don't know why everyone says this is a must see (including Lonely Planet and the New York Times). It's a park, plain and simple. And a hot and humid one at that. I suppose if you've never been to a botanic garden before, you might be remotely impressed but I found it to be a waste of time and energy."
"A dry February has resulted in the gardens being decimated. Brown, hot and uninviting surrounded by dead and dying exhibits and all lakes drained. Confusing sign posts become increasingly annoying."
"I took a solo trip to the botanic gardens early on a Saturday morning. I arrived at 8am via bus from my apartment, ready to explore, get some exercise, and rest the mind.I entered to park to find screaming children on scooters, a family with a crying toddler that somehow managed to follow me (despite a quick pace) to, and around the rain forest trail, followed by an extremely rude local who i saw yelling at a random man to ""get out of his [insert expletive] country."" I captured the man on video and ended up having to share it with security.I want to give this place the benefit of the doubt but i really cannot. Entertaining sure? But not in the way I had hoped. Unless there is some secluded garden I'm unaware of, save yourself the frustration."
Big and hugeDisorganizedNot very attractive as compared to other places in Singaporerecommended for a skip for travelers who have limited time and lot of things to cover.No internal source of travel
"Reading all the reviews that have been written before me, I wonder if there is something wrong with me!On a rare day off, I walked around the Gardens, which seemed rather sterile and bland. Yes there were the usual trees/ lakes/ lawns but maybe I am bespoiled by trees that are 150 years old or more in Ootacamund India, or the Cycas that was planted in the late 1770's at the Kew in London!It had no character and was utterly devoid of charm.But, yes, it is green, it is free and since there are only a handful of attractions in Singapore, this becomes one that you have to add to the list!"
"Not as expected a garden, but more like a park in the city. Was hoping to see more tropical plants but a bit disappointed."
"We went here because of the high rating it has on tripadvisor. Although it seemed a place the locals enjoyed for walking dogs and going for a run in with good paths and a lot of greenery, if you only have a limited time in Singapore I wouldn't recommend this as there wasn't much to see for the amount of effort in the heat"
"Seriously, the only reason you'd be amazed by this place is if you'd lived in a concrete jungle your whole life and never seen grass. It's all manicured lawns and bog standard trees and you could be in any park in any city on the planet. Don't bother."
"There has been a lot of money spent in the gardens and enclosed hot houses. If you are a local there is a cheaper price which makes tourists feel like second class citizens. We paid the money to go into the two covered gardens, it was not worth it. It is obvious that the whole garden is still in the early stages of growth with lots of Garden bed and infrastructure still showing through. If you are a local with kids go for a look if you are a tourist come back in a couple of years when the plants are established."
"There is little to either see or do here, but the park is huge so you will find yourself walking for ages and getting nowhere."
nothing was improved since 1998. it is sad to say. but it is actually a very nice place to hang out with family. But nothing is new at botanic gardens. I believe many things can be offer at that garden.
"These gardens are beautiful but if you are pushing a wheelchair and want to visit the orchid garden, just forget it.We followed the disabled signs painted on the ground and they led to steep stairs every time! I was so upset because we had to get my son out of his chair and get him down the stairs, and then come back for the chair. It was a nightmare. This happened 3 times with 3 different signs.Also, there is a reduced fee for pensioners, for which I am grateful, but nothing for disabled people. This was also disappointing.Somebody needs to sort out those signs so that no one else has the same problem that we had today."
This would have been great on a cooler day. It was so hot I thought I was melting. Lots of people picnicking and very lush.
"Whether you are visiting Singapore or you live here, the Botanic Gardens are not to be missed. The gardens are a perfectly manicured masterpiece of tropical plants, trees and flowers. They have meandering paths throughout the gardens and plenty of shade to stay cool on a hot summer day. Though I haven't been yet, apparently the Orchid Garden is well worth seeing. We went with some friends and their kids to the SPH Walk of Giants and were pleasantly surprised by this fun little 'playground' for kids and adults. We've also done a lot of running around the gardens and love taking all of the meandering paths. Take a morning or afternoon and just wander around the park and then end up at the Botanic Gardens MRT Station where you can find some cool restaurants to quench your thirst and rest your weary legs."
"Heard so much about it that the family decided to go for a picnic in a week day. The kids, 14 & 9 started playing badminton for fun on the grass with a shuttlecock and rackets (no net) and nobody around. We could see old pensioners spying on them (apparently there are lots of them in the park working as spy's to report to the park security force). Sure enough a buggy of park state troopers arrived and told us to get off the grass as playing was not allowed. Back's up Singapore as being a ""no"" land: no playing, no going on the grass, no having fun.Kinds of defeats part of the object of going to the park!"
"Firstly we are locals and this is one of our favourite places to relax and wander around in Singapore. Definitely recommend a visit, especially in the evenings when it's cooler. Nature never disappoints, it's usually the few humans in it that do.We were there at around 10pm - 1030pm one evening. We came across a wide wooden foot bridge across a little pond. We decided to lie down, at the edge of the bridge to enjoy the moonlight.Only about 7 people passed us whilst we were there for about an hour and a half.Firstly, we would like to point out that this bridge is more than wide enough for one to two 4-seater golf carts to drive through.2 staff members drives up in their cart, telling us that we were not allowed to lie down on that bridge. We were completely dumb-founded.It was near the middle of the night, there was no one about by then, we were not blocking anyone, we were not yelling loudly, we were not fishing, just 2 friends, (fully dressed by the way) lying quietly enjoying the nite. Frankly speaking, we do not see what the problem was. We were not causing any inconvenience to anyone, or any plant at the moment.For a place that is suppose to offer relaxation and calm, it is far from that in this instance. Very sad that this type of blinkered attutude and lack of discretion as to when to enforce ""Rules and Reguations"" appropriately is not taken into consideration.But of course, we are in a society that bans the sale of Rum and Raisin ice-cream after 1030pm just because there is an alcohol ban in general. What more can we expect?Other than that, great garden ~ relax and enjoy if you can but you better check where you can or cannot lie down, whilst you are at it, maybe even check on where you are allowed to stand or sit."
"Our Cable Car Ride to and fro Mount Faber Sentosa was an enjoyable one. Blessed with good weather, we could enjoy beautiful, breath taking views. Our family of 4, enjoyed tremendously. Highly recommend and do remember to get souvenirs!!"
"Young family with 2 kids, love that we can put the stroller inside the car. The kids love looking down , so much fun we got the year membership.I am impressed with the safety and costumer service of the cable cars."
"Nice and scenic ride . Came during non peak period , so no queue , which is great . Took both the Mt Faber and Sentosa Lines and both views were great ."
"I have traveled to many places till now however this was my solo trip to Singapore. I went to Sentosa Island by the Singapore cable car. This was a wonderful experience. You can see the whole Sentosa Island from the Top, especially Universal Studios (one of the attractions of Sentosa Island). I just love the ride. It is of around 5-7 minutes ride but it's amazing. I would highly recommend the visit once at least. Whenever you get a chance to visit Singapore you must visit there."
"Amazing life time experience, It was the first time traveling in a cable car and it came out to be a enjoyable ride."
"It's often difficult to find something in Singpore that children will enjoy, but the Cable Car will please the whole family. The cable car runs from Mount Faber to Sentosa Island, you get a good view of the Keppel Harbour. The gondolas take in the Mount Faber Line and the Sentosa Line. I have done this trip sevreal times, it's fun.."
The cable car experience was really great. We could see the city from the top and view of Sentosa island upon nearing Imbiah lookout.
"We had to get a taxi to the top of Mount Faber to the cable car station, it was a little busy but in hardly any time we had purchased our tickets and ascended to the platform to hop aboard.My partner is GREAT with heights so had a bit of a panic when aboard the car. It was very entertaining to watch and we laugh about it now but if you or anyone you're travelling with has a fear of heights I would give these a miss.The journey was smooth and we got spectacular views of the harbour and a completely different view to the city.At the half way point some more people got onto our car but there was plenty of room and it didn't feel intrusive.In total it lasted about 10-15 minutes from the starting point of Mount Faber to our destination of Sentosa Island"
"For our last day, I had planned to visit Sentosa. While there are a couple of way to get there the best is the cable car. It is easy to get to using the subway, you simply take a short walk way that connects the buildings. However, don't forget to take a full ride and go to Mt. Faber as well. While both Sentosa and Mt. Faber are great attractions on their own but taking the cable car is a great attraction as well. One way you get great views of the Southern Ridges of Singapore. The other way you have an amazing view of Sentosa and the open water. Both ways you get an incredible look at the cruise port and downtown Singapore."
This was a great experience and because you can ride it over and over you can arrange for it to provide a sunset experience traveling between the farthest points. Well worth the added cost to include Faber park.
Great day doing this to Sentosa Island to go to aquarium and then return trip to Mt Faber for lunch. Fantastic views from the cable car and highly recommend this trip.
I recommend especially if you have just a little time in Singapore. Was nice to see the city this way.
"A ride across to Santosa island via the cable car helps put every thing in perspective. You are able to take some amazing aerial photos. It's not expensive and well worth it and when on the island also do the island cable 3 as well.The days went were very quiet (coronavirus) effect. No ques and no waiting, absolutely wonderful. The Singapore govt as very informative and proactive in reassurance of their actions to counter any instances of infection. We spent 14 days in Singapore three of us 52, 65, 80 and we did every attraction and point of interest recommended and at all times we felt safe from any possible infection."
"We took a taxi from the Sangria-La Hotel to the main entrance for the cable cars so we could go to the island and the mountain (it mountain is really the highest point in Singapore, not much of a true mountain).The island was a good place to see the beach and attractions, primarily catering to families with children.On the way to the island we passed over the cruise ship Azamara Quest (which we had sailed on the year before, just a coincidence)The view of Singapore from the 'mountain' is worth taking the cable car trip.The restaurant close to the cable car was a welcome resting location to take in the sights, (good service for a tourist type of restaurant)So when the air clears (Coronavirus has ran its course), be certain to add the cable car trip to your Singapore excursion list!Wear something that you want your picture taken in since a professional photographer will take your pictures as you depart."
"We took the cable car from the main land over to the Island on our last day in Singapore.The cable car is a great way to see and get to the island, it wasn't expensive and staff were friendly and helpful."
"We took an excursion on the cable car,great scenery ,very interesting,well maintained and kept very clean,lots to see if you disembark at Sentosa island but it was very hot in the middle of the day so we opted to return to the Mnt Faber loop ,very interesting but a bit difficult to get to if you are not in a taxi."
"We have 3 year kid , first we doubted that he might fear as the height is large, but he enjoyed a lot. That much safety they are providing , and its like an car ride and the view of sentosa from cable car is breathtaking view."
Great way to be back from Sentosa. You could see entire Sentosa. Highly recommended if you are not afraid of height.
The view from the car is incredible as you cross the bay and take the side route over silosa beach. Fear of heights made this a little more exciting for my wife.
With my two kids we were 4 but the cable car authority and the operators allowed us a full car which we found a full of family privacy and comfortable journey to Santosa .Thank you so much people for your nice support . Also they offered low cost ticket and package which we found very helpful .
What an awesome experience!! It was such a beautiful view of Singapore by night. I would recommend this to others who visit Singapore.
great time was had. small easy walk from the cable car to the look out at Mt Faber. great view of the city
Whilst visiting Singapore we decided to take the cable car and visit Sentosa Island. Very comfortable ride with tremendous views along the way.
"The iconic cable car of Singapore. The cable car connects inland Singapore and Sentosa Island, also inside Sentosa Island. Though there are others means of transportation but the cable car is the only one that gave amazing scenic experience. It's a must visit for all Sentosa Island tourist."
"There are two lines of cable car, one from the mainland to Sentosa Island and one which takes you around the Island. We boarded from The Harbour front shopping Centre and first travelled up to Mount faber to enjoy the views of both Singapore itself and the harbour and then the passage to Sentosa. We were somewhat alarmed as on arriving at Mount Faber it began to thunder and lighten, however we were told that it was perfectly safe and the weather made for some dramatic photos.Once on the island we explored the various attractions on offer including the Universal Studios park and the Madame Toussauds exhibition. We did not go in but continued our cable car tour around the island, again with stunning views of both the islands attractions and the Singapore harbour.One interesting feature of the cable car is that you can book a dinner on it. A unique treat fro a special occasion"
"We really enjoyed the cable car, a novel experience for our little children and a great way to take in the vastness of Singapore and Sentosa."
"The first and only cable car in Singapore, it was a novel experience to ride on it when I was younger. Brought my family out there yesterday and we thoroughly enjoyed the upgraded system with cleaner larger cabins. Views were fantastic as always."
"Have to enjoy heights to travel on this ride to Sentosa. This is the best way to see Singapore, out to sea and Sentosa all in one."
We visited Sentosa and caught the cable car while there. There are two cable car runs - one to various spots within Sentosa Island and the other running from Sentosa to Mt Faber. The views are great and allows for a greater perspective of the area.
"The view is amazing, specially if you do not afraid of heights. I do...but still the view is amazing... Try it, check it yourself!"
"This is great value, but it is very high in places, so if someone does not like heights then maybe think again!Well organised and clean the views are amazing, we did not pre book it just did it on the day, worth it for the amazing views."
We used the Cable car to access Universal studios & pre bought our return ticket through Klook. Downfall we didn't realise Mt Faber had now transport available after 6pm - no issue we circled back to the middle stop & used a 'Grab' private cab.
Used the cable cars to get to the historical site at Fort Siloso where you get an insight into the daily life of the British soldiers who occupied Singapore before ww2. A pleasant ride across the water and on up to the walkway to the fort.
It was really nice and a smooth ride. The panoramic views were spectacular. You will take many good pictures!
"For our first visit to Sentosa island we decided to get the cable cars across and we weren't disappointed. The views are amazing and as we had our own cabin it felt very peaceful and relaxing. On our next visit to Sentosa we got the monorail back which in comparison was very cramped and stressful so if you are debating between the two, cable cars are the way to go!"
"This was our first time in Sentosa.Our taxi dropped us at the cable car station. We had to go up in a lift and we did not have to wait to get into a cable car. They are on a continuous loop so we had the car to ourselves.The views were amazing as we soared over the water and across to Sentosa.We flew over the water park and eventually came to a stop.It's a wonderful experience, and one we'd love to do again. It's so quiet and peaceful."
"Went to Sentosa island by the cable car, you pay for the cable car rides and any other attractions that you wish to visit at the ticket office, we just decided to add the aquarium to the cable car. Great views over Singapore from the cable car, after visiting the aquarium we boarded another cable car and went to fort Siloso well worth a visit as there's a ww2 exhibit there. You probably could spend all day on Sentosa depends on what attractions you are visiting."
"Sentosa is very expensive as you can't do anything without being charged, however the Cable Car is well worth the SGD$35 round trip. Make sure that you get off at each stop and walk around."
The views are gorgeous and it goes over the Dolphins you really get a great look at all the sea animals. We thought our 7 year old granddaughter would be alarmed because it is quite high but l think she loved it more than anyone. Because of the costs we tended to use the Mono Rail. But this is a must.
A great way to make your way to Sentosa Island. Beautiful views along the way. Th cable car was very clean and you dont have to wait for very long. Highly recommend as long as you are not afraid of heights.
Really a nice way to get to Sentosa. This was the starting point of our fun filled day. The view is so nice and relaxing. Another check on my bucket list.
"In short, views, views, views. From Faber Peak to Sentosa, you get a sore neck checking out all the great sights."
We were skeptical if the decision to choose Skydining on Cable Car for our anniversary would be worth but it was fabulous. The staff agreed to serve Indian 4-course dinner (booked just 2 days before) and the experience of seeing great views of sunset & popular attractions is amazing. The process of laying out each course during each round is unique and we felt like celebrities!! Food taste is authentic with sufficient time to finish each course.
"Ride this as a round trip, and skip the interim destination. It is extremely touristy (Universal Studios, shark tanks, etc) and not worth the time. However, the trip over on the cable car is awesome. The views are amazing and it is the longest cable car over water in the world."
When in Singapore do a visit to Santosa by cable car. Pick a week day less people going to the beach. It truly is a great way to get an overall view of the island.
With the two routes available and a variety of interesting landscapes to take in - the Singapore Cable Car offers impressive views as well as ease of transport to and around Sentosa Island.
"Great way to get to the island , 2 cable cars , one that takes you to the island and another that goes the length of the island .You can get some great pictures when on the cable car of the bay and the island ."
"This Cable Car Journey can be accessed while going to Sentosa Islands, Amazing and Breathtaking View."
We did the forest trail to the top of Mt. Faber. This is the start of the cable car to the harbor and on to Sentosa Island. Once on Sentosa there is another cable car that takes you across the island. All is included in the round trip price. A peaceful way to float over to the island and give you a wonderful perspective of the fun below.
"extremely nice experience in Singapore when you go to Senthosa, if you are visiting Singapore this is must do thing, Highly recommend to travellers"
"Loved the return ride to Sentosa with family. Only glitch, watch who you book with as it took three times at Mt Faber counter, a phonecall & new email to get the right barcode entrance ticket we had paid for. A little stressful but they did help."
"From Cable car, you can see miles n miles of beautiful Singapore..... You get 2-3 stops wherein you can get down and join the cable care again...Awesome view from the top"
We book the dining experience on the cable car. Not knowing what to expect. Well we weren't disappointed. The food was delicious and a very high standard the staff were amazing. Yes it's pricey but everything is in Singapore. My partner and Step son and his wife throughly enjoyed ourselves.
Cable car a must go to Sentosa Island ~make sure you buy the Santosa cable connection too~Faber Peak is a great opportunity to see and walk around the highest peak of Singapore ~get of this station walk to the look out stations ~see the happy bell~ happy starirs ~I cought the sunset got real lucky was the best experiance happy I made the choice ~
"The Singapore Cable Car links the main island of Singapore, from Mt Faber, to Sentosa. When it was opened in 1974, Sentosa was rather barren, now it's an entertainment centre. The cable car is good fun, it's something childen will like. By the way, a fatal accident in 1983 damaged the Cable Car's reputation. Current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Long led the rescue team. These days, the Cable Car one of Singapore's most popular family attractions."
"If you're looking for a great way to see amazing views of Singapore, then the cable car round trip is the way to do it. You can get off at Sentosa and at the other end too (sorry, can't remember the name of the stop) - but just being that high up and seeing most of the city, the bay, its infamous docks/shipping area and experience the skyline of Singapore is enough! It's so cheap to go for the round trip and well worth taking if you want those once in a lifetime holiday snaps."
Excellent way to see the island. fun and safe. Kids would love it. You get to go on three cable cars for the price of one.
"Wow, beautiful view, smooth and steady ride. We got off at Mount Faber and had calamari and drinks at Dusk, super views, great staff. Ended at Vivo City. Definitely do this."
"The access to the cable was easy , the view was fantastic and you could see for miles on a clear day.You get an overview of sentosa island and the shipping harbour well worth the cost"
I stayed in Singapore for my job. I had the cable car experience in Singapore during my stay there. The experience was just awesome as you would have the ride over the Sea in Singapore with an enchanting natural beauty. I recommend this cable car experience as must in Singapore
"We had booked for the 4 course private dining but when we arrived they had no details of our booking. This had been a birthday present for my husband so I was getting upset thinking it may not happen but Pierette was amazing and got us onto the cable car and made sure our experience was special, thank you Pieretrte, we had a great time x"
"Whilst in singapore this is a must do attractionThe cable cars are relatively inexpensive, we did the day pass giving us the full use in all directions.Views are spectacular"
This method of transport to get to both Mt Faber and the island is a hair raising ride. The views are amazing once you get over the height you then have 5.40mins to enjoy the ride. The windows in the cars are large and offer a great view to the harbor and across to the mainland. Excellent value
"There are many ways to get over to Sentosa Island, but for those of you who love an aerial view, I highly recommend taking the cable cars.I'm slightly kicking myself for not taking them during the day. But, it's not all bad, as I had the chance to literally watch the sun set over a nation. As you can see, the photos captured were reward enough!I believe that I made it to Harbour Front station at approximately 6pm. I was given a discounted rate at the ticket office due to riding at an 'off-peak' or later time. I will say that the entrance to the ticket office and lifts to the cars from Harbour Front Tower 2 are quite confusing if you don't know where to go and are dependent on following the signs/ Google Maps. I did quite a bit of walking around for approximately 20 minutes before I arrived, but perhaps that's because I kept getting lost!I took the full roundtrip from Harbour Front to Sentosa, Sentosa to Faber Peak, and Faber Peak back down to Harbour Front to experience the full journey. However, you can also purchase one-way and single itinerary tickets if you so desire."
"The cable cars offer a different view of SingaporeOn a clear day you can see great distances,giving an overall view of SigaporeWorth the trip"
"what a nice facilities, first time to try this cable car, fantastic experience, a spot that you can't miss when you travel to singapore. highly recommended"
"Leave it to Singapore to make cable cars integral to the country's transportation system (primarily on Sentosa Island). There are two lines with several stops where you can get off and explore. The cars themselves and the stations are clean, safe and reliable. Yes, you're in Singapore for sure!"
"The botanical gardens are well presented, neat, and readily accessible. Well worth the time.I highly recommend a visit."
"- Cheerful and helpful staff; my family got lost/confused when we were about to go home and rode the wrong cable line (instead of going back to harbor front we went near Sentosa Beach , a nice, young fellow help us to be back on track)- Our toddler was in awe of the view from above during daytime and nighttime. We are lucky that it was not that hot since the cars don't have AC. Tip: Do not ride the cable cars during summer or sunny day.- The price is right if it means that they get to maintain it, pay there crew right and keep everyone safe and happy. I feel that they were able to do that. For discounts, try looking for package deals- It is indeed a great way to get to Sentosa."
"The Singapore cable car takes you over to Centosa Island, it was a really unique way of having an aerial view of Singapore and the busy harbour. The cable car is well worth a visit."
"The Cable cars is one of the ways to get into the Sentosa Islands. there are three stops where you can get down and again get into the cable car. A very unique experience, if you haven't experienced it...go for it."
"Very safe, comfortable & pleasant way to explore! Also reasonably priced, easy to get to & helpful friendly staff at each stop. Did get very busy at Mt Faber station but otherwise not much of a wait to get on. Loved it!"
"Went here with my family and a 4 year old. Got my ticket online in advance which will give you a good discount. We were going to go to universal and decided to go there via cable car. We went early around 8:45am which basically is the first trip. Started at harbourfront then went to mt. Faber first (went for a few mins of sightseeing and pictures) then headed out to sentosa station where we boarded the sentosa line to soliloso point (went out a few mins) then boarded back to merloin station. Went to universal from the station then in the afternoon boarded the cable car to sentosa station then back to harbourfront. Basically, we covered the entire cable stations. Nice experience specially if you have kids on board"
This was by far the best way to travel to Sentosa island ! The service was very efficient and so friendly -we also took the second cable car to Sentosa beaches which should not be missed !
Went from Mt Faber to Sentosa. Price approx. 36 sg dollars each and for 3 dollars extra each multiple station stops so worth it. Could do with a few more fans at certain points to keep you cool while queuing to board cable cars. 30 min wait to board. However have to say views were stunning. Went to Merlion and to solisa point. Passed away 3 hours. Bring camera great pics. Bring hat and walking shoes can get quite hot. Amazing lack of atms around such touristy spots so bring cash. Harbour front best place to get off for taxi back to city. Really enjoyed same highly recommended.
Whilst in Singapore you must visit the Cable cars with exceptional views of both Singapore and Sentosa Island. A great way to be transported to explore Sentosa Island and Universal Studios. We took a day pass so managed to have wonderful views at night as well after returning from Universal Studios Sentosa Island.
"Riding the cable car is a wonderful experience, looking Singapore, as well as Sentosa Island from above. The views were awesome and enjoy all the beautiful scenic moments. It's one of the best ways to go to Sentosa island and a must recommend if you are in Singapore. Tickets price is reasonable."
The cable car was agreta experience. The views were amazing and the operation a was smooth and the staff were polite. Worth the ride.
happy to travel by Cable Car. nice city view and relaxing.good price for raveling... I went with my friend and we will travel again..
very well managed and nice service. Visited Sentosa by taking cable care.Sentosa is a tiny island and it's very beautiful.
"One word for this experience in cable car is Amazing. Must visit if you are in SingaporeYou get a full view of City.Well organized, mantained and managed.Will be a good experience for kids"
The cable car ride from Sentosa to mainland island Singapore is beautiful. We did both cable car rides - one short one in Sentosa and the longer one to mainland Singapore. It is a must.
"Ride is fantastic, wow, it gives amazing view of sentosa. Equivalent to the ride the cabin is clean & neatly designed. You should be informed well before taking the ride - to depart @ which station."
"This was such a cool experience. Taking a cable car to a man made island paradise is something you definitely can't do most places. It was run very efficiently, I had no wait. When you arrive on Sentosa (island) there's a surprisingly cool gift shop - reasonably priced unique trinkets. The way back is a little more complicated as you take two cars and that confused me - but to be fair I had spent the day at Universal, Hard Rock etc and I was exhausted and not 100% sober. The signage isn't unclear, it's just a longer walk than I thought."
"I'm terrified of heights but loved the cable car. It was daytime when we were on it & never much of a line up.We got off at each of the stops between Sentosa Island & Faber Mountain, also did the cable car that goes across Sentosa Island to get a good view of everything there."
The cable car offers a good way to get into Sentosa Island and offers good views as well. Buy tickets for both sets of cable cars
"Pre-booked tickets. Staff very happy and helful. We did the round trip. Got the wrist stamped and were called ""power rangers"". A bit of fun was good."
We got on the Cable car at the HarbourFront tower and got off at Sentosa Island where we spent the day. It was a great relaxing ride across with some awesome views of Singapore.
"I am so glad we decided to take the Cable Car across to Sentosa Island. A smooth, comfortable ride and the views are amazing"
Aerial link between mount Faber and Sentosa resort. Enjoy the Faber peak and Sentosa with cable car sky network
I read a blog prior which recommended catching the cable car from the harbour front up to mount Faber to have a look around and then go across to Sentosa Island. This worked really well so would definitely recommend this route.Don't miss Faber peak views and the toilet with one of the best views in the world (in the cable car building). Once on Sentosa there is a further set of cable cars included in the ticket price. These give great views over the island.
"Cable car goes from Harbour front to Faber park to Santosa and back. It is a wonderful experience to aerially view and cover this entire area, Faber park, Harbour front and Santosa. Maintained very well. I liked it very much and recommend to the traveller to Singapore."
A fantastic way to see Singapore from above. The pods are spacious and well ventilated. We really enjoyed the trip.
"I went from the beach to Mount Farber in 40 min.There are two tracks for the cable cars. I took both. It is a good and fast way to get the the big southern island. It is common to see the locals use it as well. Te full day trip price is 35SGD, but for just 4 extra dollars, you can get a year round pass. It is just super hard to get that pass. Great views of southern Singapore.To get the pass, you have to go back to the station that you bought your ticket from, then tell them you want to pay for a year pass. They will instruct you to go to a website then you have to wait two weeks for confirmation and I stopped there.You can get a family pass as well."
"Get an all day pass and explore all the routes... yes there are several. You can pop into the themed area of Sentosa, catch the monorail to the beach (included in ticket) and head to Imbiah Lookout. Travel all day to your hearts content... but know that if you travel early (9am) you have a chance of missing the crowds. Take your swimmers. Disappointed to see that Sentosa is now a fully functioning theme park with Universal Studios and many more attractions. Kids paradise!"
We enjoyed travelling from Mt Faber to Sentosa on the cable car. Offers a lovely view of the Harbour.
"One of the best cable card visited so far, was with my friends and enjoyed the ride a lot got scenic views of the island and the city altogether a must visit for everyone visiting Singapore."
"The views from the cable car ride were spectacular. My husband is scared of heights but managed this ride. You feel safe inside the large cars and they run smoothly. We alighted from Faber Peak and enjoyed the ride right through to Sentosa Island. We travelled over the top of two cruise ships last time and you get a birds eye view of some of the activities happening on Sentosa Island. There was no waiting to buy tickets and a small line to get on which moved quickly. If you return to Faber Peak, cab drivers dont wait there you will have to organise pick up, or just return to the Harbourfront centre."
"Mount Faber is a good starting point. Then you can buy tickets and link up all 3 rides.Stop off at any and explore. Great for photograph buffs both on and off the cable ride.As usual, lots of gift & souvenir shops, Coffee bars and food shops.Can be a lovely half days entertainment."
"After many visits/stop-overs in Singapore over the years, we finally undertook the Cable Car ride - once during the day up to Mt Faber and then across to Sentosa Island - and a nightime return jouney from the Island. Absolutely fabulous. Well organised and great views. Will made the efoort on our next visit to do the wonderful Singapore Cable Car again (and again!)"
"Mount Faber starting point is beautiful. I took a taxi and fell in love with the area.The booking office was really helpful, explaining you can get off at a stop, and also encouraged me to go to Santosa to extend my cable car journey. So glad that I did!Even from the ladies washroom, the scene is magnificent and gave me more courage to see more. I went mid-morning when it was quiet and had a cable car to myself. When I first set off, I held onto the side of the chair, and then let go and looked beneath me and all around to such beauty. I stoped off at Santosa, got another cable car to the end of the line, and spent the afternoon at the beach, and had a lovely meal. Then go the connection back. Tips. get off at the Harbour so that you can get a taxi as taxis at Mount Faber are very infrequent."
Fantastic views and given panorama. Definitely worth the extra dollars. Make sure you do the Mt Faber link as well.
"Take te Cable car across to the island and discover it is bigger than it looks there are three sections of the cable car and your ticket covers all three, do not miss any and if you are polite and ask you will be able to go round again if it is not to busy."
Had a wonderful trip on the Singapore Cable Car/ make sure you go to Faber Mountain to catch the cable car from: superb views. Then head to Siloso Beach in the cable car and enjoy lunch on the beach! Wonderful day.
An amazing experience. You can get beautiful aerial views of the city and Sentosa Island. If you time it well you can get both day and night views. You can also go to Mount Faber Park to get good city views from the heights. I took a one day sky pass which allows you to board and get down at each station on both the lines once. To get city views travel on Mt.Faber line. To get views of Sentosa and its beaches travel on Sentosa line. I would suggest to travel on both since both cable cars and the views you get are different.
"This is by far the most convenient way to get to Sentosa plus you'll get awesome views of Singapore. We opted to take the ride around late afternoon so we can get the view of the sunset and a bit of night lights. I also advise to go around this time as the cable car can get a bit hot inside during the day since it's not air conditioned. If you are a group of just 2 or 3, you may get to be joined into another group since I think it has a capacity of up to 6-8 people? Anyhow, I enjoyed our experience here."
This is a great way to travel fun for any age and the views are amazing. Definitely a must do. Enjoy
"Well planned and executed cable car system, greatly organised as with all other attractions in Singapore."
This is fantastic and such good value for money. The pass we bought enabled us to use the cable cars around Sentosa also. Great views and the restaurant at Faber Peak also has the best views over a beer.
"This should not be missed during a Singapore visit - and must be done from Mount Faber to Sentosa. Beautiful, scenic, systematic and safe. A truly fantastic experience. Best to take it around noon to reach Sentosa and return at night to enjoy both daylight & night time views."
"I went on the cable car as part of a visit to Sentosa Island with my family. It is a great way to get there. The cars are spotless and comfortable enough for the fifteen minute ride.The view is absolutely outstanding and I would think you might spend most of the trip taking pictures.The terminal on Sentosa Island gives you further travel options to get around the island, making it easy to do so.One thing to remember is on the return journey, if you are going to catch a taxi to proceed further, it is better to get off at the Harbour Front station and not the Mount Faber. This is because Harbour Front has access to a taxi rank and an MRT station, whereas if you get off at Mt Faber, you will have to call your own taxi as there is no cab rank there.All in all a great experience."
"Awesome experience when we ride the cable car to and fro from sentosa to faber moutain ,its reach at such high level that you would be able to see almost whole singapore from there ,you feel like you are flying in the air."
"We bought the pass for all lines, you can get off at each stop and have a look around or just stay on board for the round trip.The views were amazing, definitely take a camera.There were no queues for every time we had a car to ourselves.A bit expensive but definitely worth it"
Bought my ticket at klook at almost half the price for both lines. Enjoyable and scary when the wind rocks the cable car.
We chose to go by Cable Car to Sentosa Island and although I don't have a head for heights (and this was HIGH) the views were spectacular and I am very glad I did it!
"A great place for traveling You shoule try some fun activities on Sentosa island, especially Universal Studio, Wing of times ,..."
Beautiful view of Sentosa and Singapore.... well worth it . You can get there from the city by MRT and the trip out there is a great day!!
I have a real thing about cable cars so this was a must do. Really enjoyed it and went mid week so had cable cars to myself. Fabulous views and scenery. Loved it.
We had a good time in the cable ride. The cable started smoothly and die to rain and thunder lightning it was stopping in between. It was a lovely and adventurous ride for me and my family.
"From Sentosa, you can see a wide range of Wonderful and Amazing facts, surrounding the area. from variety of Amusement, Restaurants, to the very nice view of the sea and bayfronts around the Lion City."
"We did this 10 years ago and it was a good ride, very high above the ground in some area's especially over the port, where you go over the cruise ships.While in Singapore this time we went as a family from Sentosa, as we were staying there.The ride is an enjoyable one with amazing views, although I did get a little scared when the ride stopped and the cable cars bounced around twice! Above the port!.Overall it was a great experience and seeing the changes to the port area from 10 years ago was also interesting."
"I checked in cable car at Mount Faber at 10.30am and I was a bit nervous initially because of the height. As the journey begun I started to love it. The best part was when we were crossing the sea (above the harbour). I could see a huge ship underneath and it was the first time I had seen a ship in aerial view. As I pass the see, I could see a wave pool and i could hear the people screaming for fun. Then i had to get down in next station and board onto another cable in a different station few hundred metres away. It took me almost another 10 minutes to reach my destination and I was able to witness alot of mind blowing scenarios in between."
This is a must for families. We headed to Sentosa for a swim and to try the iFly parachuting. The cable car carriage was a little hot - but this is Singapore after all! Not for those with vertigo. You can look for discounted tickets online through agencies that
"We traveled within Sentosa in cable car, and it was a great experience with friendly and helpful staff"
Do this on your first day in Singapore as you get a birds eye view and a great perspective of Singapore
Unfortunately I was petrified as i'm not good with heights but was determined to try it. The views were spectacular and the cable car was sooooo high we had to change midway. Everyone loved it.
"We caught the MRT to Harbourfront and then got on the MT Faber Line. It's a fabulous way to travel, and to sit above and watch one of the busiest ports in the world. We bought the tickets to do the Sentosa Cable Car too. Lots of photo opportunities."
This cable car provides the best view of the city as well as Sentosa Island. The trip is about 15 to 20 minutes. You cannot take any better pictures without getting on one of these unless you are on a helicopter.
"We went on the cable car when visiting Singapore. It was awesome, scary but well worth the price. We took the full journey to santosa island and return. Very clean and awesome views. Oh and you can take a beer to calm the nerves."
We always include as the entrance point to Sentosa Island as it provides great views. Can be used to return to the mid station at the end of the day to the access cabs or the MRT.
Used it to go to Sentosa. Very convenient and no hassle at all. The kids enjoyed it too. Must try when in Singapore.
Check out the options and the where to get on and off. Not cheap but worth the effort to experience this attraction.
"I used the Weekend Go Where app to book discounted tickets for the Sentosa and Mount Faber Lines, which I collected at Harbourfront, Tower 2. The views from the cars were fantastic. An excellent way to cover the island of Sentosa, and more enjoyable than taking the Sentosa Express from Harbourfront.* If the queues are long at any of the cable car stations you may not get a car to yourself. We started our journey at Harbourfront. The queue was long and our group of 4 had to share with another group of 4. Not as enjoyable when you don't have the car to yourself.*"
Definitely worth trying. I went for the package deal with entrance to Sea aquarium. I thought it was quite expensive as it cost me 71SGD or 40GBP. It's unlimited rides with the cable car. This takes you to mount Faber and also Sentosa. There are great views and good pics that can be taken while on the cable car. I was lucky and twice had an empty car to myself. So didn't have to make people feel uncomfortable with my pics.The cable cars are quite frequent and you don't have to wait for long.Definitely recommend
"very safe and convenient ride to Santosa or Universal. If you are traveling with kids, please do take this. it will be a memorable visit. highly recommended."
The ticketing was quite confusing and we ended up buying two add on attraction tickets which even though are dirt cheap i don't recommend you do! The attraction/ buffet was poor. The cable car was great and we enjoyed it. I saw the meals going in the cars for the night events and they didn't look impressive .
WOW it was so much fun we travelled on this cable car to universal studios and the aquarium the cable car had to be the best part of the day definitely a must do
"I have never been on such an amazing cable car, the views are awesome over Sentosa Island and around the bay where thousands of ships come and go. This is a must do in Singapore."
"The Cable car is an exciting ride with magnificent views. The ride is in sections which take you up the mountain, then back across the harbour to Sentosa Island. Views include the harbour and surrounds and great views of Sentosa Island."
The Mt Faber to Santosa Island cable car is a fun way to kick off a day at Santosa Island. The cable car views are pretty good and it is safe and clean also.
"Took the cable car from Mount Faber to Sentosa, Arrived there by taxi. Stopover was in world trade center. After the Sentosa visit I returned, fortunately I was warned by a colleague, to leave the cable car in the WTC, as it is difficult to enter a taxi on Mount Faber, as this is a ""lonely"" place. Good advice."
There are two cable cars which connects inside Sentosa island. The view is mesmerizing. There is hardly any waiting. The entry point for taking cable is bit tricky. From Harbour front MRT station its quite far and not directly connected although its walking distance. Sentosa train station is near MRT station but cable car starting point is few buildings away. Its recommended.
"Six destinations(Harborfront, MountFabor, Santosa and another 3). You can start the journey from any place. Ususlly people start from HarbourFront. You can go to each station and get down and stay as much as you want, then get on to another car and goto the next station. You can go to each station only ones.$35 for adults and $25 for kids. Super and extraordinary view. Mind-blowing. The time between each station in cable car will be 10mins roughly."
we managed to travel on all the cable cars with such great views really nice to see parts of singapore from above
Must take the two-way ride when visiting Sentosa. It is fun and you can get down at any stop and board from any.
I don't like heights but I am so glad I went. The views were amazing. Sentoza Island has a free monorail to take you from place to place. The beaches are perfect- white sand and palm trees and beach bars!
We booked tickets to cover the whole route available and had a great time looking down on all the amazing buildings and leisure spaces. Well worth doing.
Hi booked with klook we got to the cable car in Singapore I ad my booking paperwork but when we got tgeir I adnt opened it so they cudnt access so they said cud I get my email on my phone but after several attempts cudnt the staff came over asked for my email and after several attempts and over a hour did it on their phones got my email opened it and then we ad our meal and ride so thank you so much to the staff
"The service is efficient, frequent and excellent. Every aspect of the service is fast, and we'd recommend a day ticket to gain maximum benefit from use of both lines. The individual cable cars are in excellent condition, so visibility (and photography) is not impaired by dirty or scratched glass. The views ""aloft"" are comparable to the Singapore Flyer, and there is plenty of opportunity to get some spectacular (and memorable) images, both still and video. A ""must consider"" if visiting Singapore!"
Sentosa is a paradise and with many things to do; It is a beautiful tropical island you most go. Must see.
The Singapore cable car is one of the probably best ways to travel between Faber Peak and Sentosa Island. It was established way back in 1974. It is Singapore's first and only cableway. The cable car ride is one of the highlights for any tourist coming to Singapor. There are more than 100 cabins spanning across 5 kms on the Mount Faber Line and the Sentosa Line. A joyride on the Cable Car offers one of the best 360 degrees aerial view of the entire Sentosa island and the resort. It operates from 8.45am to 10pm. Strongly recommend atleast one ride on the cable car for the overall view and experience !
Really a great experience. The view from the cable car is really breathtaking. A must do activity if you are heading towards Sentosa.
We visited Sentosa island via the cable car system and it was a great choice. Built in 2014 all of the cable cars are in great condition and for most of the time my wife and I had our own cable car. The staff were very friendly and assisted with every requirement we had. My tip book over booking dot com and receive discounts (we paid only 49 Singapore Dollars for two people)
"If u love heights this is a must try, from above u could see the beautiful singapore, truly exciting, used cable car to maount faber to sentosa"
"Having walked to Mount Faber park (gorgeous walk but a little hot and sticky from humidity) this was the perfect way to see more of the city and take us over to Sentosa.Easy and simple to use, well worth getting the full trip ticket as you can hop off at each stop if you want or simply continue on round.Stunning views on a clear day."
"One ticket covers quite a lot, so taking a few trips back and forth in the cable car, is a good investment!you can buy a cheap ticket on klook.com, they answer all emails too. :)"
"This cable car system was the first in the world to be constructed to span a harbour, which simply makes it a must see item. It was well worth the trip and it allows you to incorporate a visit to Sentosa island, where you have the opportunity to travel on another cable car line as well as the many other activities the island has to offer. Its a clean, well run service that I highly recommend."
Excellent view from the cable car.Must have experience. You can explore Sentosa using the cable car. It is well organized and the service was good
It was an unique thrilling experience of riding by a cable car. We bought round tickets which helped us to explore many stations on ground including Sentosa island. There are many attractions at each of the stations including restaurants and tourists' facilities. Beautiful picturesque surroundings and one can take lot of photos for remembrance. We thoroughly enjoyed the cable car ride.
"A really different idea! We went at six for a glass of bubbles and had a quirky, romantic, delicious meal whilst we were watching the sunset from our private cable car. Magical!"
a nice mean of commuting to santosa island. Loved the ride and the panoramic views one can enjoy throughout traveling from one phase to another.
We chose the harbourfront then Mount Faber back to harbourfront then Sentosa Line cause ive read somewhere it has the most scenic view. And yes they were right. We alight at Sentosa then headed to Universal Studios.
Although expensive at Sâ¬30 for the round trip from Sentosa to Mt Faber the experience should not be missed and provides some great photo opportunities.
After south Africa I enjoyed cable car in Singapore. The one round trip we saw total Singapore. My son 13 year old and daughter 10 year old. For us this is first time they enjoyed lot. My wife Daily talk about this Amazing Trip.
"if you have a short stay, still you want to enjoy the city then, cable care is one of the best ways to see and enjoy the city. you see the whole city from heights. everyone should try the cable car for sure if you are in Singapore for the first time."
Great way to see Sentosa it cost $35 dollars per person the gondolas are air conditioned views amazing.
"This is the best way to get into and out of Sentosa Island, the view is just magnificent. Good for kids"
"a great view over Singapore and lots of happy memories. I proposed to my wife in the cable car and she said yes. We've been in the cable car multiple times after, we still enjoy it"
"A different way to view Singapore, ride to the top and disembark, or stay in the comfortable gondola for the return trip. Spectacular views."
"Love the cable car, very comfortable to sit and enjoy the views as you get across to Sentosa.A must do when in Singapore, you can take some beautiful photos from up there."
You can take car to sentosa but this is more fantastic. The wiev is wonderful in cable car. There is some stops on it. You should lesrn where you go in sentosa before tou take cable car.
Never miss this opportunity when in Singapore.. my family and i rode this initially during the day and on our return trip at night.. see the wonderful scenery
A great way to get to Sentosa. Great views! doesn't feel like you up in the air. The cable car ride is smooth.
"A lovely end to the first day of our honeymoon. We booked this a couple months in advance. You're greeted by friendly staff, who explain how the evening will work. Then you are offered a drink to start off with, we went for champagne. You have a car to yourself and start off with the first 2 courses. We opted for the non-vegetarian option. Our starters were mushroom soup and slices of duck. Each circle of the loop is 30mins. When you get back to the beginning, the waiters are waiting with the next course and your choice of wine. We had beef and vegetables. The beef was melt-in-the mouth tender and the vegetables crunchy. To my liking anyway. The meal was delivered hot. The last course, i have no idea what it was but boy it was enjoyable. The whole experience takes 90mins. Three loops in all. Highly recommend this dinner. The food is very enjoyable and the staff very friendly. You are given an evaluation form to fill in. That easy to do and my only comment was on how to improve the experience. That was to start the trip at 6.30pm, so you could have the last loop seeing the sites in the dark. It was lovely to see the sun going down. The views were great but not the best of Singapore. I do highly recommend this experience for an early night out."
The views of Singapore and Sentosa from cable car are absolutely breathtaking! You can see everything! The water is so clear and the trip is a MUST for those going to the aquarium or universal studios! You won't regret it!
A very romantic and a leisure ride to reach Sentosa. Has all the elements of travelling to the island of fun .
During our stay in Singapore we went on the Cable Car which took us to Mount Faber and especially Santosa Island.We purchased the $55 dollar special deal. This gave us unlimited rides and entry to two Attractions. In the cable car you had the best views of this area you would want to see.Just breathtaking views and overall a photographers delight. I know i took over 100 photos and some videos.There is even a massive waterpak as one of the attractions.There are far too many to list.We went to the Butterfly Exhibit and this was wonderful. Highly Recommended. They even have bugs from giant rhino bugs right down to deadly spiders alive and on display. The scorpions made me look twice. All sizes and shapes.The second exhibit was the Massive Merlion. A three minute video on his history than in and up you go in the lift to the 10th floor gives you access to the lookout on his head and the lookout in his mouth. Stunning views and photo opportunities from both lookouts.This is Highly Recommended.The entry tickets also allow you to ride the Mono Rail between different locations.Overall this RIDE IS A MUST DO AND HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
this goes to santosa island with loads to do and see great day out great for kids especially with water parks too on hot days .
Excellent way to travel high up with fab views and allows access to the walking paths from Mount Faber which is a steep climb up otherwise. The greenery and bird song on the walk is wonderfil
"We were staying on Sentosa so we took the free Bus B to Siloso beach and went to the cable car.I had looked online and booked the tickets in advance using a different booking site and got the tickets significantly cheaper than buying them at the cable car entrance.The views of Singapore were great travelling over to the Mainland and back.We walked around Mount Faber, which is well worth doing, and the views are superb.Worth the money for the views alone"
"I took the cable car at Mount Faber until Setong Island. There was no lines, so I could go on a car on my own. Nice trip, takes approximately 20 minutes from Mount Faber to Setong."
To ride on the cable car was our main reason for visiting Sentosa Island. It didn't disappoint. We did also visit the Aquarium which was wonderful.
We taken the ride from Faber and interchange at santosa and return back. It was so wonderful trip. We seen almost entire Singapore flying over it. It was fabulous trip. One must visit this when visiting SingaporeWe bought tkt on klook.com at cheap rate.
I took this ride to Sentosa island and was an excellent experience. I recommend this to be clubbed with the cable car witihn Sentosa island which is even better with views below. Definitely a must do in Singapore
"My friends told me I had to visit the bathrooms at the Mt Faber end of the cable cars. And I did.I am not going to spoil it for you by telling you what I saw. Just go. They are on the ground floor in the building where you buy your tickets.I'm sure everyone else who writes reviews about this cable experience will tell you it's terrific, because it is.Go to the bathrooms!!!."
We made the most of our pass for the day and also went on the other gondola on Santosa Island. Allocate enough time to see as much as you can and recommend returning back at night to see the amazing view with the night light.
"The ride on the cable car in Singapore is really excellent, smooth and enjoyable. The views of Singapore from the cable car are fantastic."
"Singapore cable car has its terminal at Harbourfront , accessible using MRT. The cable car has 2 routes. One connecting Mount Faber with Sentosa and the other line is on the Sentosa Island resort spanning across 3 stations. The 2 lines are connected at Imbiah Lookout station.The cable cars have comfortable seating and good viewing arrangement. Considering its high-rise route, wonderful views are on offer, especially of the bay area. Tickets can be purchased on date of travel or online advance booking.It is advisable to go for the one day unlimited ride ticket option which covers both lines , allowing hop on hop off. The cable car is a great way to access and explore locations and attractions on Sentosa."
If you go to Sentosa island you may as well enter like a Rock star. This is it. Its a great way to see the island from the Mountain down!
"The nice views one can get from this cable car will last in our memories. You have to go to Sentosa, climb to its highest peak and then enjoy! For those who enjoy Starbucks thereÂ´s one very close."
The Cable car rides give the visitor a birds eye panoramic view of the city and coast line. Getting to the cable car tram is very easy via the efficient Metro MRT.
We booked the dining experience. 90 minutes or three rotations saw us demolish a lovely 4 course meal whilst enjoying the view.
Sentosa Island is a very beautiful place & the view from cable car is adding extra attraction. It provides brief introduction of Sentosa Island from top.
"Whilst enjoying a day at Sentosa Island we jumped on the Cable car and enjoyed a great lunch with a few cool Tigers at Mt Faber. The Singapore Cable Cars gives you a completely different view of parts of Singapore overlooking the harbor. The staff and service at Mt Faber was outstanding and i recommend the ""Bangers & Mash"" which was outstanding."
"took the cable car to go to Sentosa island. Its not a cheap ride and you cannot do one way,only round trip fare and the cable car closes by 9:30pm . Make sure you return or have to take the train back."
wonderful ride from the moutain top to Santosa...stunning views of the the city and Santosa Island..
"Awesome views, good ride so much to see. Great value for money and a ride to remember. Very clean and secure."
My Husband and I experienced the most fabulous ride with the Singapor Cable Car. We were served a multi-course dinner with wine and the food and ambience was wonderful from the beginning to the end. It was so beautiful to to see the sunset and travel across Singapore! A must to do!
"We are cable car junkies to some degree. The cable car ride to Sentosa island ride did not disappoint. The facilities to and from as with the cars themselves were very clean and efficient. You get 2 round-trip rides with one ticket - one going over the water with an excellent view of the freight harbor and docks in distance, and one across the Sentosa island at about 20 feet above palm tree tops level. It is different than the Swiss Alps type of scenery, and the glass bottom ones of HK Lantau Island going to the Big Buddha ( a bit more thrilling due to the 100% glass. Our grandchildren got the biggest buzz and joy out of it."
"We took the cable car from Mount Faber till Sentosa. I was with my children aged 4 and 8yrs and they absolutely loved the experience. right from sitting in a moving cable car to seeing a whole lot of Singapore and the Sea to getting off at Sentosa, the ride was awesome."
Must do. Mount faber peak is beautiful. Amazing view of singapore harbor. Mount faber peak is beautiful for taking some amazing picture.
"You absolutely must take this! The views are amazing. The city will look like a toy city and particularly fun for kids. To get into Sentosa, take this instead of the train. Thank me later."
Offer unrivalled views from Mt Fabsr down to Sentosa - superb photos can be taken. You get great views as you approach the island. If you buy the full ticket you can also use the other cable car on the island & ride the monorail.
We used the Rope way to reach Sentosa Island and it was a great experience. Very fascinating scenery as you go down the Hill and reach Sentosa Island. View of the Island and various Water Parks below was quite mesmerizing.
There are many other medium to reach Sentosa Island but the beautiful aerial view makes it the best. I recommend to travel by this cable car.
I personally love this journey because of the breathtaking views and the safety. You will be able to see the main island from the sea side.
"This is the best way to get to Sentosa. Amazing views. There are two places to get on, we went from Mt Fabour to get the full trip. Unfortunately they only sell return tickets. It would be good to go one way and then taxi back from Sentosa"
"Very well run, scenic and impressive. Not cheap though. I found it easy and no queues despite being quite a busy holiday period"
Singapore Santosa cable car has two routes cable car which provides all of scenery of Singapore near seaside. Nearly every visitor take the rides of this cable car and enjoy photography.
It is definitely a thrilling way to transport to Sentosa Island by cable car. The cable car moves off to high above the harbor and it was frightening at first because the sea level was so far away from me. I was having mixed emotions of feeling scared yet the view is spectacular and feeling better after the cable car is declining. The trip was quite a short one that lasts me about 10-20 mins. I will come back again.Tips for your reference: It can be cheaper to get the tickets from a third-party website.
"awesome views, special moment for me and my wife. would recommend for couples for a romantic sight seeing of singapore"
Sentosa island can be reached by road but the cable cars are definately the way to go. You get sweeping views of the city and can use your passes when on the island too. excellent
The Singapore Cable Car is a thrilling way to reach Sentosa Island. The cable car runs high above the harbor and at one point actually goes through the middle of a tall building.
This cable car is definitely a must try option. A wide view of Singapore along with Sentosa Island and port view also
We had a fine dinning evening where we had a three course meal and wine travailing in the cable car. after each complete circuit we were had a starter +Dinner + Dessert and in the back round a thunder storm . A great night out
"The views are fantastic we went over to Fort Silosa, a day I will never forget, Beautifully preserved Lest we Forget."
"Great views to be had and worth every cent. Took off from Harbour front to Mount Faber. Had time to spend at Mount Faber first, then took another back again to Sentosa via Harbour Front. Good thing was they gave each group/family their own cable car. Great touch but could be because it was a weekday!! At Sentosa, tranferred to the Sentosa Line and went to Merlion Station and then spent time at Adventure Cove. Evening took cable car back to Imbi via Siloso. Did not get out at Siloso as it looked like a storm was approaching. At Imbi transferred back to the Mount Faber line to get back to Harbour Front."
"This was a highlight as the view is terrific and you can see the whole island. The island its self is a giant theme park and the only interesting part i found was the history of the old forts, apart from that i couldn't wait to get off it, however if you have kids this place would be great for them"
"We decided to end our Christmas Day with a ride on the cable car, it was beautiful at night. We went late afternoon to the shopping centre which was so busy we could hardly move then went to the top of the mountain and back to Sentosa by cable car. A wonderful experience for all three generations of our family"
"Last here in 1983 an amazing changing landscape was to be expected, however I could not have imagined the transformation. The whole harbour area transformed from a dry dock to soaring apartment blocks overlooking a swimming pool. No better way to see it all than by the very comfortable cable car offering 360 degree views. Fantastic"
"A wonderful way to get a different view of Singapore. Treat yourself to doing this if you are heading to Sentosa. Well priced and well organised. Frequent crossings mean you don't have long to wait,"
"Travel across the harbour, across the river, across thew freeway to Sentosa island, this magnificent sky-way experience is worth the trouble of getting there. Just make sure you are facing forward not backwards because you'll get a sore neck."
My family loved our ride in the Cable Car. We traveled from Sentosa Island to the mall for lunch. It was a great afternoon with spectacular views.
Great view of the city and an excellent perspective of Sentosa. Fantastic to see the sharks in the water park from above!
"I took the hike up to Mt. Faber (easy hike). Cable car is really worth doing once. If you want to go by yourself, just tell attendant. They are very accommodating."
"If heights are not your thing then avoid this one...the first time you go out of the tower into the void is amazing ,but the views soon dispell any fear.Next time try the dinner flights!!"
"This is a must if your visiting Singapore, so well organised and amazing views we had a ticket that gave us the option to hop on and hop off whenever we wanted to, the trip to Sentosa island is fantastic, such a beautiful place beaches are stunning and then you have universal studios, what a great day out no matter what age"
It is a charming option to reach Santosa. Both interesting and educational if you have a map with you. Great for families or a business traveler relaxing.
The views give you an appreciation of this small but busy place. Staff were friendly - ride was smooth and cameras are a must to capture the sites
Absolutely beautiful views. A must do. Buy your ticket on Trip Advisor it's 1/2 the price as buying at the ticket counter and better price than the combos. Just buy a few hours before you go. The ride is comfortable and breathtaking. I recommend everyone do it. Relaxing.
An amazing view of Sentosa and well maintained with nice staff. Definitely a must-do if you're into sightseeing.
You can catch a bus or cab to the cable car. Great photos and takes approximately 30 min. You can see the lay out of Santos. I would recommend a full day pass so you are able to move between the cable car's once you are there.
Beautiful place and well maintained. We visited Santosa Island.. Exceptional good. Must visit place in Singapore
This is a great little ride taking you across to Santosa. You can spend a few hours there in the gardens and the Merlion
What a wonderful way to get to Sentosa Island. Going through the building is interesting. If you want to catch a cab back to your hotel you need to get off at Faber Peak. Great fun.
The cable car is a great way to get around some of the best tourist spots in Singapore.You have great views over the island to the South and the cost is very reasonable.
"While visiting the Universal Studio you have several options at Vivo City . Monorail, Broadwalk or cable car . The last one is the best . The charges are 30$ but it is actually priceless as you travel in that glass covered car and travel from the highest pick and have a wonderful view of the undersea and few ships , also you can see the dolphins and sharks in their parks from that top view, changing the cable car several times as it is unlilimited till 9PM."
"We had a Quick down to Sentosa island. Nice scenic view of port, the greenery below and the top view of Sentosa island. The shop also has miniature Cable car and Monorail models."
It was a nice ride to Santosa island in a cable car with lovely City and the sea view.But you have to wait in the Que patiently for some time till you get your cable car.It was a very nice experience and the staff at the loading point and the drop off point are very friendly and caring about you.
Did this as part of a Sentosa Island tour and it was fabulous....great views of areas you would not normally see...and a different perspective of the island and surrounds.
We decided on taking a late afternoon trip so we could take dinner on Sentosa Island and then catch the Cable Car back for the night lights. Well worth the visit though food on Sentosa left much to be desired!
The cable car is a great way to see part of Singapore harbour on your way to Sentosa island friendly staff although things are a little on the expensive side...
Amazing experience 360 degrees super views great night view superb overviews green country side lovely memories
I am terrified of heights but I got on this. After getting over my fear the view was amazing!!! I recommend it!
This is a great way of seeing the whole of Singapore. We were unlucky to get a group on with us called the swingers. Mostly young people who take cable cars everywhere in the world moving quickly side to side make the car swing. It wasn't long before the father of young children who by now were crying got up and stopped it. No argument from them they had had they're fun. It's a long trip and great fun
We were visiting on a cloudy/rainy day. Even so the high-ride is a great experience with beautiful views of this part of Singapore. I can just imagine how it looks on a sunny or partly cloudy day! There are also great views on some of the attractions in the Santosa Island. We purchesed the unlimited rides tiket and went few times with the second local cable-car waiting for some sunshine to get out. Anyway going up to Faber Hill supposed to lead us to that trail with the famous bridge - but it was too rainy to hike so we took the cable-car back to base.
The best way to get to Sentosa Island. The view of the many ships in the bay was great. There are friendly staff to assist you entering and exiting the cable cabs.
I love the view. But it could be very hot and long queue during daytime on holidays. Go for it before sunset is recommended.
"We ventured overt o Sentosa via cable car and it was easy, cable cars were clean and easy to get on and off"
"We were on the way to Santosa, it was getting bit darker and look at the sunset from the cable car, we love it."
"An great way to both get around Sentosa island and see the sights of Mount Faber. Trust me, get the all day pass when visiting Sentosa as you will find yourself using it again and again."
"Used the cable car to & from Sentosa & to & from Mount Faber, nothing much but eateries on Mount Faber but Sentosa is great, so much to do."
"The first time I did it was a bit tough, as I sat alone in the cubicle and during the day, views were terrifying LOL.This time my friend and I were together and went during the night from Sentosa to the city. It wasn't as bad as I thought it'll be, in fact I enjoyed it.It's a cool ride if you can handle it."
"Wonderful experience while traveling in the cable car, super great technology and world's best quality"
This is a great the views are incredible as you pass over the cruise ship terminal and head over to Santosa island . Get the duel pass so you can get on the island line to giant Merlion.Pricing is high around 30nzd for round trip but worth it if you're a little nervous with heights try it but be aware it is on of the highest cable cars . Do it at night it a whole new experience.
"This is by far the most awesome way to get to Sentosa Island. We loved it, and you can get so many amazing photos too. Really beautiful, well-maintained cars and doesn't take long - unless you get stuck in a thunderstorm (which we did!) - then you will experience some stopping."
I like the fact that we didn't have to get off the car and saw everything we wanted to see. I love seeing Faber's peak!
"I have always been petrified of these things, however as well we were staying on Sentosa, it was a great way to get around. My husband twisted my arm to go on this and after a few minutes I felt at ease.The experience was great, from the staff, the ease of getting around and the view, this really is a great experience."
"Too many ways to travel to the sentosa island and we decided to take cable car, more expensive than other, but...worth it!...Amazing views from up there accross the sea to Sentosa island. Although rainy and cloudy but we can enjoy the trip.. Start Harbour Frount St -Mount Faber St - Sentosa St. and we change cable car Imbiah Look St heading to Siloso Beach . We recomended you to buy ticket via online than on the spot.."
We decided to take the cable car across to Sentosa Island. I can't remember how much it cost but do remember thinking it was good fun so I will go this way next time. It's fun to see the island from up high as you approach and it gives you a good idea how much there is there. Both there and back we had the cable car to ourselves even though it was busy on the way back. Recommend if you want to spend the extra money. This is the most expensive way across.
"Went here with my Mrs and 1 year old baby! In fact i took this cable for 5 times in my lifespan. Great aerial view, personal fav when coming in to Sentosa, get to see the whole of Resort World and its stunning.You'll get a discount if you're citizen.The only downside is that it can be very stuffy in there and the hot weather definitely wont help but worth a ride though!"
"Buy tickets before travelling as this saves not only money but time queuing at the kiosks.We took the cable car from Sentosa across to Faber Peak, had lunch at the hilltop restaurant before taking the cable back to the island.The views crossing the high part harbour section are amazing.Even on a Sunday there were no great crowds, so we had a cable car to ourselves on both trips."
"If you are expecting to ride on the cable car at least 2 times within a year, join the annual membership, it's cheaper than 1 round trip ticket. I joined as member because my kids love the ride, enjoyed the view even after riding so many times. Try to avoid HOT SUNNY day, the cable car can be a bit stuffy. AND avoid thundery lightning day, they close the service for safety concern. Best time to ride is evening and if you can get the timing right, hop on around 8pm, you get to see fireworks from the nearby universal studio entrance.There are 2 cable car system, so if you are annual member, you ride both for free, and the car entrance to sentosa is free too. Try both cable car, the one within the island is shorter and only 3 stations, only if you are going to the beach will this make it worth the trip. If you go during day time, you see people playing the zip line across below the cable car screaming...If there is no crowd, the staff are nice enough to allow you or your group into one cable car by themselves, no need to share and your kids can scream all they want.Lastly, have a great dining experience on top of mount faber, the other side of the cable car station, the western food is delicious, service is great and the view is wonderful, cool and romantic.Nice toilet by the way, see thru glass to the cable car outside while washing your hands."
This cable car is a great ride for children and adults alike. The view is brilliant and the service too is impeccable.
"Get to the highest point on the island and take the glass bottom cars through a one stop in one of the high rise buildings near the harbor and on to Sentosa island. Great for all ages.Take a taxi to the top, go one way on the cable cars, and spend the day on Sentosa."
"The cable car ride was a highlight of our trip. We purchased a Sentosa and Mount Faber ticket which meant we could do both attractions. We got on at Harbourfront station and went to Mount Faber where you can get off and look around, however we we chose to stay on and travel back through Harbourfront, where the line travels through the building and over the Harbour. We had fantastic views from the cabin. At Sentosa you transfer to another line with three stations. There are activities at each station. The ticket we purchased meant we could only get on and off at each station once and we finished where we started,. Tickets were S35 adult and S$25 which I think is great value given you can have a full days entertainment. There is plenty to do on Sentosa."
"Fabulous views from the cable car, a little expensive but glad we did it. Can be a bit nerve racking if you don't like heights. Views of Sentosa and the harbour. Definately recommend using the cable car to visit Sentosa island. Only issue we had when leaving Sentosa the exit has you on a train that can confuse which cable car to exit the park to be where you started from."
It was a nice & different way to get to Sentosa. Great view & a smooth ride. Only ran until 9.30pm which seems a little early when you are having so much fun on the many attractions Sentosa offers.
"We tossed around the idea of going to Sentosa island on the cable cars as we had been to Sentosa Universal Studios & the Aquarium before but had never used the cable cars.Lucky we did because it was a bit scary at first but fantastic experience to get a 360 degree view of parts of Singapore, the harbour & Sentosa.For the $35 you not only get a ride to the island & back but you also get a ride on the cable car on Sentosa. This too is a great experience as you ride high above the lush green canopy & view parts of the island & outer harbour.Have lunch & a stroll around the island & get back on the cable car to take you home.Can't recommend it more. Unless you have a mortal fear of heights give it a go. You won't regret it."
"We did the MRT from Marina Bay area to get the Cable Car over to Sentosa Islan, which was easy. Thoroughly enjoyed the ride over. The views were terrific. Sentosa is great for families and thrill seekers. Lots to do, We picked up an open bus ride around the beach areas which was really good. Give yourself plenty of time as there's a lot to see."
We have the season pass and for $39 (I think?) per person it is very worth it as my kids enjoy the view of the harbor and going to Sentosa. It is a bit of a scenic mode of transport but definitely not one for those who are afraid of heights. both the night and morning views are different but my preference is for the night view as you can see the lights of sentosa...
Nice Ride with Nice View points. One way to reach Santhosa. With a view of horbor and city. Must visit
"nice trip, walking on the clouds, a helicopter view over the city, excellent time to take pictures. is a mandatory go."
"We bought the round trip on the cable cars. It was a good deal to buy both rote's and even better price wise to buy through the Klook site. We started at Harbourfront and went up to Mount Faber where we alighted. We walked to the Henderson Bridge and onto the forest walk. Then returned to Mount Faber to continue our journey to Sentosa. It was the middle of the day and rather hot in the cars. The Mt Faber cable cats have fans, but the Sentosa cable cars didn't, so don't forget a fan to cool yourself. The views were magnificent!"
We went in by chance to take the cable at night.The rides l with the beautiful night scenery of the harbor front and the Sentosa island.
This is definitely a must do in Singapore. Great way to get to Santosa Island with plenty to do there!
Caught the Singapore Cable Car a breathtaking 40 minute ride across the sky stunning panoramic views of the City and the Ocean and took some amazing photos brilliant
"Located near Sentosa, this attraction provides several options for clients to see different views of the city. Prices are reasonable & the views are amazing. Highly recommended."
"Cable car is a unique experience and must try in Singapore as you do not get such experience everywhere often. This gives you a very good view of the city. The waiting time is less and you can easily get a whole cabin for yourself even when you are alone. Although I felt a bit hot, because there is no aircon. Rest assured, please go ahead and have a wonderful experience here."
"If you only have a day or two in the city, this is well worth a ride. Well organised. Various options available to combine attractions. Amazing views."
"Wasn't sure about doing this as not to good with heights but pleased we did, great way to finish leaving Sentosa island. But we had a problem trying to get Taxi at the end as it seemed to be Peak hour, weren't sure how to get back had to ask at the mall for them to ring us Taxi, they were not keen but did in the end thankfully."
Absolutely safe and enjoyable ride from and to Sentosa. The complete ride is a little expensive but worth the money if you enjoy being suspended high above water. You can enjoy the ride with cool breeze and get a bird's eye view before reaching Sentosa.
"Worth a ride, just for the view. Amazing views of the harbour and Sentosa Island. Easy access to Sentosa, or just ride the car for fun."
"Spent the evening Dining in the cable car, what an awesome experience, service was excellent food fantastic and a lovely experience"
What a ride. Amazing views of Singapore and Santosa Island as you go. Definitely a must do when in Singapore.
One time do activityNice viewTry to get both linesSentossa and mountfaber line.Try to by online tickets try hideout.com
"if you want to feel the another of sensation to go at Sentosa island ... you can try to ride the cable car ... by paying 35 SGD you can back and forth , and go around Sentosa island. Strat from Haobourfront tower 2 cable car station - sentosa island - harbourfront - mount faber and go back to harbourfront.."
This is must take for ontime enjoyment to sentosa island with your family and friends it cost around 20 to 30 SSD
This is a must do activity. Take the cable car line to Mount faber and back to senthosa. The views are mesmerizing and the height is great too... You can come to the harbourfront station via MRT and the cable car line is the adjoining building. Recommend everyone to buy tickets online to avoid ques. I bought tickets too Klook website.Enjoy
"it is very enjoyable ride. there are 2 lines; therefore make sure you buy tickets for the 2 lines. you will see different aspects of Singapore and Sentosa. Definitely highly recommended. however, it can get a bit hot inside the cable car during hot Singapore days."
"Great value as your ticket can cover both lines (to and from Sentosa, and also internal line). Unbeatable views of the city, universal studios and adventure parks. Appear safe and sturdy which is a must when travelling with anyone afraid of heights. Lines weren't long and rarely have to share a car."
The cable car can be taken from either Harbour Front or Mount Faber. It used to be a way to get to Sentosa after which the internal mode of transport would be used. Now the cable car is also used as a mode of transport internally to get around the island so the price of $35 + includes this.
"We caught the Cable Car to Sentosa Island.Might be an idea to pre-purchase tickets as the line was long and took some time to purchase tickets.The trip itself was fabulous. Sentosa Island is not really my thing, just a giant holiday resort but still worth it if only for the cable car."
"Very good to do, I was a little scared at first with the height but was very confident on the way back I would highly recommend this for everyone."
"What a great way to get to the most beautiful island in Singapore. For a few dollars more you get to travel above the island ,North ,South ,East and West. Great way to travel if you find it too hot/ far to walk."
"One of the best experience - one ticket for multiple rounds and awesome view. Must visit for all, amazing experience - it is for all the group age group."
hopping in at harbour front and moving up towards faber peak and again gliding back to sentosa overseeing the complete singapore resort skyline is a phenominal experience.
"This makes for some great views, and is my favorite way to get over to Sentosa. Not the fastest way, but my favorite."
Cable car rides were very good. We enjoyed the rides. Well maintained. The one between Silosa beach and Merlion was not airconditioned.
"Very good experience ! good views, comfortable & we felt secure. good fun with family. We all loved it."
Wonderful panoramic views of entire Sentosa. Dont forget to try to seeing the merlion sitting from the cable car
Enjoyable ride on the cable car. Greats view of Sentosa Isand waterfront. Too short ride though. Cable cars are clean and safe.
Bought the promotion deal. Inclusive of sentosa internal cable car ride. Beautiful aerial view. Started from harbour front to sentosa. When down in sentosa n got on the internal cable car ride. Played sky luge then head back to main cable car line head to mount Faber then back to sentosa then finally to harbour front. Parked the car on the 7th storey nearby next building.
"Bought the tickets online while in Singapore, got a great discount! Picked tickets up at Tower 2 which is posted from the MRT. Took the Faber line up to Faber peak which was quite quick, views are ok nothing to write home about. After a quick pit stop we took the line over to Sentosa which offers great views ï¸ once on the Island you can pick up Siloso line cable car which has good views over the island. Good value for money if booked online would highly recommend. ï¸"
"Amazing views, just make sure you are ok with cable cars! I was not aware how high they go. But if you hold on tight the view is worth it. Make sure to go all the way to the top and tie on the bell!"
"So glad that we took cable car went into Sentosa, then take taxi back, gave us the air view and also chance drive around the manmade island."
Views and experience to keep young and old engaged. The views during daylight as well as night time ie dark hours are varied and worth it. Highly recommend to take a to and fro pass to santosa Island.
"Spectacular view of Singapore. Best way to get to santosa. A must do in Singapore. Tickets are a bit pricey, especially if you are traveling with large family"
The mount faber trek and the singapore car are very nice and you should go. It is not a very short cable car trip and it is quite scenic.
We pre purchased the tickets as they are cheaper than at the booth. Great experience - can see loads - getting off at the stops gives a better experience as you can see what is around each area
"You can access the Mount Faber Cable cars starting point and the ticket office by taxi which is the best mode of transportation. You can purchase round trip cable ride to Mount Faber or to Sentosa Island. The latter option is definitely worth it. You will be able to visit the aquarium, Universal Studio, restaurants and shops in Sentosa Island. You can relax in the path enjoy what the island has to offer. The cable car will hold up to six people and goes over the Singapore skyline and you can see the Cruise ships, barges and supply ship from the cable cars through the panoramic windows. If you just purchased the mount Faber pass then you will have to get off the first stop and visit a few attractions there. However, paying the extra to visit Sentosa Island is well worth your trip. You can have the reception desk call the taxi for you once you arrive back to the staging area. Remember your price includes round trip ticket and you can stay in Santos Island as long as you desire. The closing time is 10:00 pm"
Great fun & fabulous view from the cable car. Very good view of the city below & Sentosa Island. The Merlion looks spectacular as you approach.
"Despite the price, it is well worth taking the Cable Car to Sentosa Island. Starting from Mount Faber station, it is a comfortable and photogenic way to see Sentosa from above.Crossing over the Harbour and overlooking Adventure Waterpark, you start to get excited about the day ahead.Our main aim for the day was Universal/Adventure Waterpark, however on the way home, we stayed on the Cable Car to view the Megazip Adventure Park.The Cable Car comfortably seats 6-8 people and is very safe and doesn't sway like other cable cars around the world.As mentioned by other reviewers, if you require to get back to Singapore CBD by taxi, best to alight at Harbourfront Station."
"We got On the cable car at harbour front and set of for mount faber.We walked to the top and a lot of history was available about Singapore through the ages.After looking at the view, we headed to Henderson Wave!Omg, amazing piece of structure.We walked the whole length before heading back to the cable car to go on to Sentosa island.The cable car on to the island is pretty high and great views.Coming back at night, it was pretty special (in my opinion)"
I always have a dream to go in cable car..I have taken 1 way cable car to sentosa island..it was amazing experience n liked the cable car..In one car 2 pax can travel
"We bought a return ticket from Mount Faber. Tip: on the way back it's better to get out at the Harbour stop - a lot easier to get a taxi. The views are spectacular, different at night and during the day."
Our family went to Vivocity and bought the $68 family day pass that included unlimited cable car and two activities/rides at Sentosa. We all enjoyed the nice views the whole way. Highly recommended and will come back again.
"Very nice experience that really worth to try it. It is necessary to improve the transfer to and from the start, which is done only by taxi!"
"We arrived in the early morning for a brilliant view of Singapore, and Sentosa. Please experience the majestic views for yourself, you wont be disappointed :)"
"One of the many ways to access Sentosa Islands. The ride is good, though we entered the wrong building to access the boarding point. The two day pass includes a ride by the cable car so do not purchase it separately. May not be suitable for people who are afraid of heights"
Well the cable car trip is amazing with great views in all directions. Gives an awesome perspective on the layout on Sentosa as you pass over the island.On return we went up to Mt Faber enjoying the scenery and views. The walk down if you choose is pretty awesome also.
A great way to get to Sentosa An exciting trip across the water at a reasonable price with clean cars and friendly staff.
"This journey is very nice, relaxing and amazing view up sky.You will see a lot of view amd stress free. There is also stopover area, you can look around, selfies and food court for eating"
"Worth having a ride on them both to Sentosa, and in Sentosa. They are very high, as they cross from Singapore to Sentosa, so the view is specacular."
Definitely the best way to visit Sentosa. Great views of the main island as well as the little Sentosa island from above. It is highly recommended though a bit too expensive for the short distance ride. That's the only reason I gave it very good rather than excellent.
"As well as great views of Singapore this is the best way to travel to Sentosa Island to visit Universal Studios, Singapore Luge & all the fantastic activities on Sentosa"
"We took the bus to Sentosa but when we got there we took the cable car back to Singapore and then back to Sentosa! We had a car to ourselves, which was great. We then took the cable car at Sentosa and did the trip around there. Worth a go!"
If you fancy some relaxation while in Singapore use the cable car to visit Sentosa Island. Loads to do there or just go to the lovely beach
One of must try attraction at Singapore with stunning view.U can use Cable Car from Singapore to Sentosa Island and at Sentosa Island too.
We took the ride to Fabre peak just on dusk.the sunset and then the city's lights were beautiful. We also took the other gondola as well another day.
We loved our trip on the Singapore Cable Car. You can stop at multiple locations including Sentosa. The views are stunning on a clear day. I highly recommend this experience when visiting Singapore.
"CYC+CG ( 18.07.19 )This cable car was from Faber Mount to Sentosa Islands. I think this cable car was the best means to Sentosa Islands. The view of Singapore was good during cable car. The price was a little higher than I think, but the way to Sentosa was the best by Cable car."
What an amazing experience it was to take the Cable Car from Faber Park to Sentosa Island. The smooth ride over the landscape of rainforest and water was exciting and breathtaking! High up in the air gave an excellent overview of the Fun Island with all the facilities in view. You could literally see for miles!
You can have complete view of the city while taking the tour of Cable car from Faber Park to Sentosa.
"Went on trip to Sentosa including a visit to the aquarium was well worthwhile, over 50 sharks to be seen!!"
"Fantastic Views and a great way to get onto Sentosa.Day was overcast and a bit stormy when we went, but it was still awesome"
We bought the unlimited ride package and spent at least 5 hours travelling around by cable car and viewing the various sites at each of the stops. We started fairly early (around 10 am) and had each cable car to ourselves up until our last ride in the afternoon when it started to get busy.Definitely recommended to spend a few hours here.
Although you may go through Train and Taxi to Sentosa but the best way to reach is through Cable Car. Little heavy on pocket but worth the ride.
We rode two cable cars that intersected from Sentosa over to the mainland. We stopped for refreshments at Faber peak and then rode down to the bottom. Great views and a smooth ride all the way.
"We were very luck as a local used his card to give us 50% discount, so we paid $35 for two for both rides. So clean and staff helpful, bathrooms very good. Cafes have very good coffee. We went early and had no waiting to get on or off the cars. Great views.. the gardens are beautiful. No wait for taxi when we finished at Mount Faber"
We always to the cable cars anywhere we happen to go. And these ones certainly didn't disappoint paid a couple of dollars more to do the park and the city well worth the extra
"Very Good Experience with Cable car,relay its time was amazing. we have ful enjoy and good feel with cable car"
"We took this cable car from Mount Faber to the Harbour Front and then the second option on to Sentosa Island itself.Mt Faber gives you some great views but the ride on the cable car really is tremendous - super views over Sentosa Island, the bottom part of the Malacca Straits, Singapore Harbour and then back over to the CBD.Thrilling and it really does let you see so much then you can appreciate just how dynamic Singapore's growth and development has been.Really worth it - but save you pennies; a bit expensive."
"Get off MRT at harbour front and walk through shopping centre to purchase tickets. The cable car takes you to two separate routes - one to Mount Fabre and the other to Sentosa. You can travel to both. It is very high and a great experience.There is not much at Mount Faber a cafe and a walk but I went in June and it was really too hot to walk far.A great way to get to Sentosa, there is also a boardwalk and monorail you can use to get to Sentosa.As we had walked to Sentosa we went both routes but disembarked at Mount Faber. Can't remember the cost but it is not expensive and a great experience."
"We had a great experience on the cable car. It was such a fun way to get to Sentosa. You'll be able to see the city from high above. If you ride it at night, you'll see the city light at night. It's beautiful. Best way to go if you plan to visit Sentosa."
"I will suggest every one to travel in Singapore Cable car, the kind of landscapes you see and the feeling you go through are the life time experiences.its really safe to be on this cable car."
"Great view over Sentosa and best way to get there, a must try even for the faintest of hearts and the most fearful of heights. The view from the cable car is all worth it!!"
Its best thing to travel around Singapore its main stop will give you full access to main attractions of Singapore to visit.
Was everything we expected and more from the taxi driver to the people who worked there a great day out
"MRT to Harbour point, the cable car to Sentosa Island all for 25$, enjoy the views of the beaches and Ships waiting to enter harbour.Take the sky walk to Siloso Point to get an idea of the past and defence of Singapore.We were only there for the morning, you could spend all day and still want to go backA great day out for all ages"
Catch the cable car for an aerial view of Sentosa Island and arrive in style. See all the attractions from overhead. Return trip was not expensive and saved the hassle of trying to park your car.
We went to Sentosa island by cable car. It gives thrilling views of the southern coastline and a bit of the city. A must for Singapore visitors.
"This is another way to reach Santosa Island from the main island. There are two cable car lines - One that goes from Mt. Faber to Santosa Island and another within Santosa Island. Both are fun and highly recommended!! View of Singapore is breathtaking and if its your lucky day, you can even get to see Cruise Ships from up above. It can get crowded but everything is very well organized and managed."
"It was worth going just for the main cable car ride, we then added a few activities, zip line and Jade our lunch in one of the beach cafÃ©. Went to the mountain stop seemed it was just geared to eating in the restaurants."
"I love cable cars and this one was fun and such a great view of Sentosa, would love to go on again at night because the views would have been spectacular."
"Up near the sun, life it`s wonderful and the view make you more than happy! Nice, clean cab, very good stuff. I advice to take such a trip to everyone."
"We started at the Harbour Front, then went up to Mount Faber where you can walk to the Henderson Wave which is an interesting bridge across a large gorge. There is always the Happiness Bell to ring near the restaurant. We then went across to Sentosa and then picked up the cable car that runs the length of Sentosa. Sentosa is a holiday resort and has loads to do. I braved the zip slide where the drive to the top of the hill was nearly as adrenalin draining as the zip slide itself. The slide is over in no time. A spoiler alert, when they weigh you as they fit the harnesses, they write the weight on your wrist band. It is the heavier customer that speeds down the sip slide"
Great way to see some magnificent scenery from Mount Faber to Santosa Island & view the ships going down the waterways. Some great views when passing over Santosa to the final stop.
Just do it! Excellent from start to finish ..we timed it so it was light on way to Sentosa..and dark on the way back.Well worth the effort.
The cable car ride is smooth and super which takes you to Sentosa island. Timings 9am to 9pmAt first I was scared but slowly the fear went away. Staff is polite and helpful.It's so well maintained and beautiful the surrounding that you forget everything else. Can go from Sentosa to mount faber and back.Experience -Maintenance -
This is the cable car that takes you directly to Sentosa.... offers unparalleled birds eye view to the waterfront and the underlying resorts as if you are flying into sentosa...
"$33 for a single trip. $39 for a year of free cable car rides - called the Faber License. You do the math.We took the Faber License for the family & have used the cable car so many times, we almost feel guilty. But that does make us come over and over to Sentosa. Even if I don't want to go, the kids drag me along. So - good move, Sentosa.The views from the cable car amazing. Breathtaking. Thrilling. It goes over the woods, a bus terminal, commercial buildings, through a building, over the waters, over Resort World Sentosa, over the Sentosa attractions, the Sentosa leg of the cable car gives you amazing views of the island.You have a birds eye view of the Singapore Ports, countless ships, the beautiful waters off the coast. It is well - worth it."
We felt very safe even though we were high up. A wonderful view of Singapore and Sentosa Island and we could see the storm clouds roll in.
"kids loved the ride, nice view of the sentosa isle.. very well maintained service and stroller friendly"
We enjoyed this ride with fam ..being able to see how beautiful singapore is!!! definitely we will comeback for another ride
"We had a round ticket that took us up to Mount Faber and also to Santosa and the views across the harbour were great. As ever, exits are through the gift shops but we were able to get a couple of souvenirs not seen in other gift shops. A worthwhile trip."
"They were very organised getting you on & off the actual cable car but we were super lucky & as we had arrived early we were near the front of the queue. There was only 1 person processing tourists, who at the best of times need confirmation as to what they are booking and where they are going...that poor woman I am glad she couldn't see the length of the queue...eek. The cable car was great....clean, airy, stable and a great view."
There are a few lines connecting mainland with Sentosa. A chance to see all the island and shouldn't be missed.
It is a really fun experience. you get to see Singapore and Sentosa island. You get a picture at the end of the ride.
"Unbelievable views across Sentosa Island and into Singapore, and some great shopping when you stop near Vevo City Mall."
"If you miss out on this attraction you have seriously missed out on one of the best views every, the photos attached will speak for itself, let me not bable."
I heat a excellent view of the city from the top of the cable car when I was going to sentosa island tour.
"I stayed 8 nights in Singapore in May 2018. I took this chance to come to Universal Studio (by using the Sentosa Express) and twice to Sentosa Island by cable car. The view is absolutely incredible from there and should really not be missed. You will pay 35 Singapor dollars from Harbour Front Station, having then also the possibility to use the cable car located on Sentosa Island, which I will advise you to do. You will also see some dolphins from you cabin, upon arriving over Santosa Island !!! I will soon add some photos for you to see what I'm talking about. This transport is fast, safe, efficient and definitively unusual !otterboris"
"Plenty of frequency,even at busy times,Great view over the island and to Singapore.We had bought a three event ticket,and with a $10 topup gave us the ride on the cablecar."
"If you you're going over to Sentosa for the universal studios or for just sight seeing, you need to at least take the cable car over at least once.. what a view. This is a must see and do."
"Nice view, value for money ( buy tickets from agent, almost half price)Safe for kids and old people"
This is just a fun experience. I love taking my visitors on this over to Sentosa so they get that amazing view.
this cable car connects sentosa to mt faber . we had taken a round trip fromsentosa middle station and back .the 15 minute ride was so relaxing in the afternoon after hectic sight seeing in sentosa .well worth the money
"We took this amazing cable car ride to Sentosa from Mount Faber Peak to Sentosa Island.There are more than 100 cabins spanning almost 5 km on Mt Faber and Sentosa linThe cable car ride offers you a 360 degree aerial and visual treat to Sentosa Harbour andthe Resort Island. A great place to go with a family, but be prepared to spend a day there a d I suggest you research Santosa before you go to be aware whats available....a butterfly house, Universal Studios, Insect Ki gdom and Fort Canning where the British used the fortas headquarters after the Japanese invasion till 1945 to name a few attractions. Clark"
You can view harbourfront from this cables car. Very nice staff. You can go sentosa island also with this cable car
its a small ride approx 15 mins but its a experience to reach sentosa by the same. 6 pax max in a capsule
A must must ride for entering Sentosa - this is the longest and highest cable Car I have ever experienced.The view from the top most point is wonderful and enjoyable.
"We toured the city, then used the Cable Car to head to the Universal Studios across the bay. What an incredible ride, I highly recommend it."
"The view from here is spectacular, especially at night. You can see the cruise stationed in the harbour as well as the beaches in Sentosa. Price is a bit more compared to monorail but its worth it."
"Birds eye view of Singapore, with Sentosa at one end and Mt Faber at the other. Buy tickets in advance to save but be prepared to still queue when you get there. Plenty of photo opportunities ."
"We took a grab back, but this was an adventure to get to Sentosa island! I am scared of heights, but still enjoyed this experience! Great way to travel and see the sights!! Booking online saved us 40% vs buying at the ticket counter, so make sure to do that!"
"The view fom the cable car is great, felt safe even though very high. Great way to see Sentosa Island and Aquarium."
"Took cable car from vivo city to Sentosa islands. it was a great experience in the cable car, nice view of sentosa island."
"The cable car from mount faber is a fun way to reach the most sought after attraction in Singapore aka Sentosa Island, the cable is at a height that i have yet to see and one travels accross a water body to the island from the mailand, this ride gives you a chill coz of the height and vast waterbody below you. but its a smooth ride and a fun experience once you overcome your initial fear of the height"
the first time we used the cable car was from sentosa to the city and the day after we took it from the city to go to the water park with the kids
"This is another one of Singapore's must do! Even though it can be a little scary, at all times it felt safe. The view from this height is stunning and again, so lovely, shiny and clean."
"* There are two cable car lines in Singapore , one is Faber line and another is Sentosa line .* Faber line starts from Mountfaber and goes till Sentosa. You can also board the cable car from Harbourfront Tower 2 floor 15 and travel up to Mountfaber, there you can spend some quality time with nature and again board back cable car which will go to Sentosa via Harbourfront.* Ticket price is 35 SGD per head if you buy it from the ticket counter , However you can purchase tickets online with much discounted prices ( we got them worth 19SGD ). This ticket includes to and fro both.* It is a well managed and enjoyable activity. I would recommend it totally to everyone."
"This is definitely one of the highlights of our vacation, offering spectacular views of the entire City and Sentosa! Take time to visit the beach as well!!"
"A 40 minutes ride from sentosa towards the city with good aerial view of highways, serene bungalows , river is enjoyable"
The view from the cable cars are unbelievable and prices are reasonable. We went across to sentosa island and found everything efficient and relatively easy. Can be very hot though as many cable cars have no fans so be prepared.
"Well maintained and safe. We enjoyed our rides to Sentosa, Merlion and other stops. Its is an alternate means of transport from Mt Faber to Sentosa. Another option is to reach Vivo City mall and take the free Sentosa express"
"I bought an adult fun pass for $55. I rode the cable car in the morning - I made sure I was there by 8:45am when tickets go on sale, then I rode it again at night. With the fun pass I also got 2 'sides' so I had the buffet dinner which was average then saw the Wings of Times show which was good (if you have small children note there is fire, fireworks & some loud noises that may frighten them but in saying that there were plenty of kids there). It's also very busy there so give yourself plenty of time especially with transport after the show. The cable car ride was good."
"I bought the family round trip with extra excursions on the island. Bad move, my wife didn't take well to the cable car, itw as a one way experience for her, but me and the kids love it. Its goes very very high, but if you're careful doesn't shake too much. An interesting route to Sentosa, also known as ""Pleasure Island."""
A not so great experience for those with fear of heights but definitely a unique experience. You can have a great view up there.
i dont like heights but the ride was incredibly smooth.There are 2 stages one is the city and for a little extra you can go to sentosa island which we did.you can get out and have a walk around do activities then hop back on and it is convenient location close to transport.Great for families
What a thrill! My stomach turned when we were launched from the bay and the height was scary. Great way to access Sentosa and we finished the day with drinks from Mt Faber the highest point of the cable car
"After arriving at the MRT station NE 1 from Little India station NE 7 (12mins) we followed the signs for exit B & the Harbour front cable car station. We first took the cable car to Mount Faber, being a group of 8 we had a car to ourselves. We got out of the car at Mount Faber to have a look around & to ring the bell of happiness, on re-entering we took the cable car right across to Sentosa island passing through Harbourfront station. On reaching the island we jumped onto the Sentosa line which took us to Siloso point. After visiting Fort Siloso via Fort Siloso sky walk (Free) we took the cable car back across the island to Merlion station. After a long day on the island using the monorail & beach tram (Free) to get around we returned to Merlion station & took the Sentosa line cable car to Ibiah lookout then transfered to the Mount Faber line back to Harbour front. Well worth buying the roundtrip ticket as the views from the car are both sensational day & night."
This fabulous experience was part of our Sentosa Island Tour with RMG. Truly amazing. Coming down in the cable car from Faber Peak you enjoy views of the hill top park before launching out over the worlds busiest harbour. Truly amazing and breathtaking ......excellent way to see and get to Sentosa Island.
"Everyone should experience cable car to Sentosa Islands, its beautiful, the only cable car in the world which crosses across Cruise station. Its amazing......."
"We took the ride on both cable car lines to experience Sentosa island ina compact way:-). Very safe, not bumpy at all despite the thunderstorms striking here and there. What makes fun are some passengers ordering the dinner to the cable car (and riding in both directions here and there) :-)."
"Breathtaking view from the cable car, moving at a comfortable pace lets us enjoy the ride and views all around."
Although a little pricey its a trip you need to do at least once to get to Sentosa. Just be careful they are pretty ruthless you will only get a complete round trip especially for the Sentosa line which is a little painful as it would have been good to use it to commute around the island as a hop on hop off for the day.
The cable car is a must. The view is fantastic and great pictures of the harbor and city can be taken we paid for a round trip and it was worth it. You can take the next cable car down to Sentosa beach. They have a little ice cream outlet at the station serving coconut ice cream that is to die for. It i served in a coconut shell. We had planned on going zip lining but upon seeing that they did not have helmets for the customers we changed our minds. All and all though it is a great way to spend a day.
A great trip across the two lines - which is well worth it. Sentosa car is good too and it is all worth the journey. Catch a cab up to Faber then go to Sentosa line and fluff around there too. You can then catch the free train back to the mainland.
"Thoroughly enjoyed the Cable Car experience - the views were fantastic - what else can one say. If you want the view then take the Cable Car.P.S. I've got to say however, that I don't think I would indulge the Meal option. But that's just me."
"The cable car ride was awesome, though there were pretty long queues.... i guess going on a Sunday was not exactly the best idea. That being said, we really enjoyed the ride. You get a great view of the city and the ride is pretty comfortable (not recommended in the afternoon), since the sun can be rather harsh. This is one of the fun ways to get to Sentosa (or back) or to Mount Faber."
The station of cable car is little far from the MRT station (walk through the shopping center) and expect to wait in line (about 15minutes) or book online. But much better view from cable car than from the crowded sentosa train (we went there on sunday)
"This cable car gave you great views of singapore and sentosa Isalnd. You can then use it on the island to get to other attractions. We spent the afternoon looking at the army tunnels, climbing the Merlion, and then waiting for the night light and water show which was a highlight!"
"This was the one thing that i wanted to do while in Singapore and it was fantastic, i loved it from go to woe...:) the view was awesome and once again it was Clean and safe, a good speed in which to take the view in:"
"I am not a fan of heights, but this was a great experience and opportunity to see the Singapore skyline. We did an early morning trip due to the heat and humidity. I would recommend this."
This is such a great experience. We did it on day one and got a good overview of the city. Definitely recommended. Lots of fun for kids to see Sentosa from the air too.
Cable car is good way of transport to Sentosa island. I will recommend you to get to and fro ticket with which you can take the cable car ride inside Sentosa too. The Monorail can also be accessed from Imbiah lookout to go to other attractions.
"The trip was good.The cable car was good,safe & goeas over the important places at Sentossa Island.One can purchase the tickets,online or at the counter at the island."
Little pricey but great activity and beautiful Sentosa Island. I recommend buying a package which covers 2-4 activities as well - definitely value of money.
"It was easy to redeem our voucher that was included in Singapore Airlines Explorer Pass that we bought. With this pass we got to take the cable car from, 109 Mount Faber Road. You get on at Mount Faber, it take you to another stop which you can get off or stay on to continue to Sentosa. It is worth taking it from Mount Faber because you get to see two sets of scenery. The scenery is over the waters and it is beautiful! We took the cable car around 5:30pm the sun was starting to set and it was great! There is no air conditioning, it is open air, the doors have large slits to let in the air from outside. Note: It is free to take the tram out from Sentosa, it takes you to Vivo, a large mall, go down two escalators to the public transportation area. While at Vivo, you can go to Irvins which is in Basement 1 or 2, to buy Salted Egg Potato chips, casava chips, or fried fish skins...super yummy!"
"I loved this. We got a ticket to do the whole lot and enjoyed the views, and the short walks around where the stations were located. We did it during the day, and the views were lovely. I would've loved to have done it again one evening but we didn't get the time."
I can't highly recommend enough to ensure you do this.This is a must and you need to do this.The views are amazing and your photography part of yourself will love this.
"The view is very nice ideally one should go from harbor front till sentosa. The ticketing system is easy, but there is only one drawback. One has to take to and fro tickets one way ticket is not there."
The cable car experience was brilliant and well organised as are most things in Singapore! We booked online and tickets are valid for up to 60 days...saved a little bit of money.We didn't have to queue at all for any of the cable cars.Shop at the Sentosa stop was surprisingly good.We didn't spend much time on Sentosa due to time constraints and basically just went for the cable car experience. It was well worth it. Easy journey from harbour side mrt station. We combined this trip with a visit to Chinatown as it was only 2 stops away.
This is a superb ride you see everything along the dock lands and the island too. We climbed to the top to ride and this was a great view
"This is a lovely way to see the south part of the island and start a morning or afternoon over to Sentosa. Get on/off at Mount Faber National Park, Harbourfront Mall or Sentosa or just stay on for the whole ride. The kids love it! Bring a drink though as there's just a small fan in the cars and it does get hot and stuffy!"
"it was a very nice trip through the cable car to sentoza island and the view was amazing , seeing the whole island and the attractions below you especially the dolphins as they perform was a nice areal view"
"Weather was good today, made a on the spot decision (è¯´èµ°å°±èµ°) to take a taxi ride to Mount Faber Cable Car Station. It was almost 3 years since our last ride when we were back to Singapore for a month. The queue was not long even though it is on a Saturday. Nevertheless, it is still the most expensive way to enter Sentosa.Initially a little apprehensive about riding in the sky (great heights), both kids got over their fear and loved the ride a lot. For us parents, it is a joy to see their happy faces.For residents in Singapore, suggest that you can consider getting an annual membership (SGD 39 per individual and SGD 135 for a family of four), taking a ride every quarter will more than pay for your membership fee.Looking forward to another cable car ride with my kids in the next few weeks. Will plan for a night time ride."
"You can drive to Sentosa Island, but I highly recommend taking the cable car ride. The view is fantastic."
"Even though it was rather a short trip, we had a thrilling experience watching the gorgeous view of Sentosa Island. We got a round trip ticket but only used one way. Perhaps next time, we can enjoy the ride for longer."
Take a day to see and do Sentosa Island. Take a cab to Faber Peak and buy a day pass on the cable car. You'll have a fantastic elevated ride across to Sentosa Island and a couple cable car routes on the island.
"Very beautiful !A very nice place to visit when u r in singapore...it is a gondola lift from mount Faber to sentosa island....from it , u can have beautiful view .... it is mainly machine operated system...it is totally safe and no need to be panic for anything...it have 6 stations in between....don't forget to enjoy cable car....."
"A must for sightseeing, photo op for picture taking, and seeing the surroundings in a different way!"
"Good way to Sentosa, however taxi is the only way to it. The views are excellent as you cross the water."
It was a nice day to go to Sentosa. I decided to go with the cable car incl. Mt. Faber. It was a nice day and I can recommend the trip.
"Took the cable car from Mount Faber all the way to Sentosa Island and return to Mount Faber. Stopped off at Sentosa for a quick walk about and paddle in the sea. Lots of attractions on Sentosa, inluding water park, lady river, universal, dolphins, Merlion, many eating places and lovely walks through gardens. Cable cars are modern and safe to ride, good photo opportunities from the cable car. Cost is dependent on the package but basic ride approx Â£25."
"The cable cars are excellent for the views everyone is able to enjoy,swaying gently in the breeze it offers a rare opportunity to gain different views of Singapore, I am glad to have taken this rae opportunity."
You can use this cable car to get to Sentosa Island and it provides some stunning views of the area. Fun way to get an Ariel view of Singapore.
Must to do when visiting Sansosa Island.... great experience would definately recommend to add this to your itineraries.
The views are spectacular when on the way to the island and there is a tourist ticket that allows use of the system. After travelling down from Faber Peak you need to take the cable car to Fort Siloso. This is an excellent historical experience - particurly the Surrender Rooms. Also there are no charges for visiting the fort.
I'm really scared of heights and was very nervous about doing this. The experience was great! I found this the smoothest gondola I've been on. The views are stunning. There are 3 segments to it depending on where you need to go to on santosa. Was clean and very well organised. This really is a must do.
Cable cars are not my thing but this one was smooth and a great way to see different views. Tickets are reasonable and we spent a pleasant day touring around Sentosa island via the cable car.
There was so much to do could have spent longer there is a Beach if you want to spend so time relaxing.
"We purchased a round trip ticket (can only leave from each station once) and it was the perfect way to get around the island. There are cheaper ways, but we had a great view the whole time and it wasnt really busy either.If you're happy spending a little extra to get around, definitely recommend it."
This is THE way to get to Sentosa Island. We found it to be lots of fun and took it several times during our stay. The city lights at night are different from the views during the day and it goes slow enough that you can take some great pictures and really take in the sights. I highly recommend this one.
Highly recommended atleast oneway to sentosa through rope car. Excited and thrilled to go above Singapore
"Mount Faber cable car ' A great way to look around. We arrived in Singapore late at night and so took the next day to travel by MRT to Mount Faber Park and its cable cars. Just take the MRT to The Harbourfront. The tickets are surprisingly cheap, especially when doubled up with the Sentosa Island ticket ' a steal at S$22 each or about Â£12 each. The cable cars go really high up the mountain to a restaurant and some shops and offer some fantastic views both of the docks and waterfront and across to Sentosa and Singapore in the other direction. They are incredibly smooth cables ' no rocking or jolting, and like everything in Singapore ' very, very clean."
I went there very special to looking around but abit noise with Chinese groups very cloudAnd I can see hotel and whole city in Singapore
What a view !!!This cable car is a must. If you buy a pass that allows you to jump on and off you will get to see a lot. The views are amazing. It seems to go for miles. You will not be disappointed:)
This was one of my highlights of Singapore. The view are spectacular. I did a round trip which if book there is slightly more expensive.
The ride is quite long and crosses over the harbour (above cruise ships) and glides over tree tops in which you can hear the monkeys calling to each other. You can take additional routes to reach different areas of Sentosa.
"If you want a fantastic view of the harbour and the city, this is fantastic. There are really 3 different segments with various attractions at each stop. Well worth it."
This tram ride is a great way to see the other side of Singapore. It takes you from Faber Peak to Sentosa Island that is a must see attraction while in Singapore. We had a fun time riding this fully safe Tram. The tram ride starts close to from Vivo City which is the biggest shopping mall in Singapore.
You can reach to sentosa island by cable car .universal Studios and acvarioum.sentosa island is the Best place to enjoy and stay
Amazing views of Singapore. There is a hill-top bar at one end. Perfect at sunset for a cocktail and snacks.
"I left my iPad behind on a bench seat during a visit. After a while of panicking - as it contained all my photos, etc - My wife received a phone call from a friend in Australia saying the iPad was in the gift shop. While the cable car staff had assisted by searching on the cars, a gift shop staff member, Princess, showd amazing initiative, ingenuity, IT-nous, and customer service. When the iPad was handed in to the shop Princess went to where there was wifi reception, contacted two of my Facebook Messenger contacts and the second one (in Australia) phoned my wife to say where the iPad was. Princess recognised us as soon as we walked into the shop (as she had asked my contact to send a photo), and was very excited to be able to provide the service which meant our problem was solved. Top marks to her!!"
"Great view from Faber Peak, and from the cable car across to Sentosa Island.We just got a taxi from our hotel to the Peak, and paid for the ticket at the window, was not crowded or busy first thing in the morning.This is a must do in Singapore."
Don't worry about being 'up sold' by the ticket office - spend the extra dollars for the 'full' round trip package which lets you ride both cable cars all the way around (rather than just doing the Santosa return which is a false economy) Breath taking views - you have to do it - $66 dollars for two people.
Mt. Feber itself and then the tram across and back. I've done the Cable Car both times I've been to Singapore.
Lovely view of Singapore from above. Great way to enjoy the harbor. I bought cable car ticket with Wings of Time attraction and I got discount.
This cable car ride is a must do. going over to Santos island the views are spectacular. take the train back and then you can taxi back to hotel restuarant.
"I love riding cable cars. Good thing I 'own' the cable car in SG because I am alone inside, no other tourist.Great view of Sentosa and the nearby beaches/bay. Not as high and breath-taking as the Maokong Gondola in Taipei but neverthelss the experience is worth it. One can get this at a discountat 48 SG$ combined with 2 more other attractions in Sentosa, so it is a great deal for me."
Its one of the best cable car experience for me. There are two lines for Singapore cable car so I took the cable car for sentosa beach. I started from the station and went to sentosa beach through cable car. Its highly safe and well maintained. It has capacity of 4-6 people ands decent speed. Its totally made of glass and give you beautiful view of the senotsa beach. Enjoy the ride!
A trip to Singapore is incomplete without a cable car from the harbour front to the island .. We bought tickets at the station for a return ride .. Its one of its kind trip .. enjoyed thoroughly
"One of the best experience especially if you are with your family and relatives. I bought a ticket in another website that starts with the letter ""K"" and it was worth it. I do not know if I can put the name of the website here but you can just search it, it sounds like a cook, five-letter word, starting and ending with the letter ""K"".The promo tickets were worth it. We were able to ride both the Mt. Faber line and the Sentosa line. We started from Harbourfront MRT station towards Sentosa. From Sentosa, we took a round trip in the Sentosa line. Then we went back to Mt. Faber for our lunch since the promo tickets that I bought had a lunch included in it. After our lunch, we went back to Harbourfront again using the tickets.It was really a very wonderful experience. It will conquer your fear of traveling via cable car and think it was a first time experience. Also, the cable car can accommodate 8 people and we are 6 adults and 1 infant so most of the time, we had the cable car for ourselves. We visited Singapore last February 16-17, 2018."
"I like the cable car because it's relaxing to be above the city. If you go after 6pm, you get a discount, and I think that is a nice time to go anyway because then you get to see both day and night views as sunset is about 7pm (the 7pm sunset is year-round in Singapore as it is close to the equator). You can also walk around the park at the top. Highly recommended."
We hadn't been to Mt Faber for years but the cable car wasn't much different. Once we got to Sentosa though there were lots of changes including a new cable car route.
"So we took the fabulous MRT all the way to Sentosa and decided to take the Cable Car back ... well, you must pay for a round trip ticket, even if you are only going one way. So needless to say the experience for us was a bit expensive but the view from the car is great (in a clear day)."
"My family and i really enjoyed the cable car,kids were worried at first,panoramic views ..good afternoon for the family"
Great experience flying high over the harbour to the Island. The process was well organised and very busy. However the cabins were clean and offered great views. A good way to get across to visit the attractions.
Went with all the family 5yrs to 66yrs. All felt safe and in awe of the wide variety of views. Need to carefully work out the two cable car routes.Very nice family or couples experience
A must do in Singapore. Great views from the top going across. Very well supervised. Safe for the whole family.
So well done and such sensational views - it really is worth it. Thought I would panic - silly me it was just wonderful.
Worth at least one ride. Check the operating times as it doesn't run early mornings. You can go from Harbourfront up to Mount Faber or over to Sentosa.
"If you go to Singapore have a ride on this cable car, what a view and very stable. plenty of places to gt a bite and drink."
"Was a very easy ride. Comfortable and a lot less crowded than the monorail over to Sentosa Island. We had the full length travel ticket which meant you could ride on it all day if you liked. Also , it was helpful getting around Sentosa island itself"
"There are 2 lines operating here, one connecting faber park and one with sentosa. great for a short journey from vivocity to sentosa island."
Fun activity to do while in Singapore reasonable cost and no line ups when we were there (On a Friday). Everything looks new and clean and shiny. They must have excellent maintenance. Awesome views from the gondola...up to Mt. Faber and out to Sentosa island. Can get some great views from the ride! Recommend doing for sure while in Singapore.
Views are great & it's nice to peacefully go far above the hustle & bustle below. cable car to ourselves quite romantic experience.
"A great way to see Singapore harbour and water front, great photo opportunity, not cheap but worth it"
"Nice to travel out to Faber Peak. Very peaceful place away from the city. Nice place to have a coffee or cold drink and just relax for an hour. Great way to travel out there and superb views over the city, river and Sentosa Island"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our ride on this cable car, we went up to Mt Faber on it, then over to Sentosa and then had another ride on another cable car on the island, all on the one ticket. Great Views, friendly staff and it was easy to get to on the MRT"
"Very easy to get on and off, staff at all points are so so helpful and friendly, goes very high so probably not good if you are scared of heights but cable cars are comfortable and very sturdy feeling plus views are amazing well worth the trip"
"Awesome Jaw drooping View, best way to travel to sentosa island.Easily approachable, do take a return two way pass as you dont want to miss the night view of Singapore,"
"Taking the cable car from Faber Peak is just one way of reaching Sentosa Island in Singapore. One may also take the MRT train or go by car. But I would recommend taking this cable car because of the scenic view it offers along the way. The ride is much shorter compared to the crystal cable car ride from Tung Chung to Launtau in Hong Kong, but exciting just the same. From the cable car, you can get a good view of Harbourfront Bay below.A one-way ride from Faber Peak to Sentosa would cost you SG$29 (for adults). To do this, you take the Faber line (30mins), which connects with the Sentosa line from Merlion Station to Siloso Point Station (15mins). I would advise that you take the combined Mount Faber line and Sentosa line for SG$33 instead of having to buy separately for the two lines (which would cost you SG$42). Cable car is daily open from 8:45 AM to 10:00 PM."
A stunning way for going from Mount Faber to Sentosa. Originally built in the 1970s this is the 4th rebuild. The highest tower to give you the best views.
"The really cool thing about this kind of transportation is not just a way to get to Sentosa Island, is a mini network of a sky MRT. You can actually get off and back on at different stops. The ticket prices are not cheap, but it's worth the price to see Sentosa and walk around the various areas or even down to the beach. A must do in Singapore."
"Even if your scared of heights like me, give this a go, its a smooth way to get across to or from Sentosa with great views of the Island, harbour and Sentosa. And how can you not do Singapore without doing the cable car??"
"Cable car is just perfectYou could take the cable all the way from Mount Faber peak which is a beautiful place to hike, to Harbourfront mall which is a great place to shop and eat. Then the cable car goes further to Sentosa island.Along the way there is this fantastic view of Keppel island. What more can you ask for.Tip: Go with a member to buy the ticket at half price :) :) Enjoy!!"
Plan on spending a whole day on Sentosa Island. You can possible go here by car or bus but you would be missing out on the amazing views provided by the cable car. The wait is not too bad.
The cable car offers some spectacular views over Singapore and Sentosa Island. Worth the ride to see it all.
"To reach the theme park you can travel by road, but this is much more fun and you get some amazing views of the city and other surrounding areas. But be carful, because because at every station someone will initial your ticket and you can get caught out for extra money, so make sure to plan your trip."
This is a very scenic ride and is a must do if you have kids. You can get really good pics and it's a convenient way to travel in Sentosa.
"Nice and great experience for my family, We enjoyed the ride, and the Tour adviser at Boss Hotel Gave us lot of tips which was very usefull"
Woo ! what a wonder experience Indeed. We were with 2 kids and too a return ride from Faber Hill and back to Sentosa (did not get off) - it was a great 30 min ride over the sea and harbor. Though it costs about $29 return for adults - it worth the visit. The station is a little hard to find (need to ask around). We were also given some fridge magnets as gifts for taking 4 tickets.
The cable car ride is a not to be missed activity.There are different stations on the two lines and one can get down and see around the various attractions in sentosa islands.The view from the cable car is fantastic and the service is efficient
We went there last year and experienced one of the very attractive location in singapore. It is surely great fun.
Was well worth the money spent we did the unlimited cable car and waterpark packagesThe views were absolutely breathtaking it wasn't busy the day we went and had the cars to ourselfDo this attraction
Start the cable car ride from the Mount Faber itself for a better experience. Views are beautiful. This is the best way to enter Sentosa Island. Kids loved the ride.
"These cable cars offer fantastic views of Sentosa and the surrounding harbors. You can even see the zipliners and the bunge jumpers, as well as the massive Merlion."
The cable car ride was fun. But the directions to move from Sentosa to imbiah station is outdated because of the construction. Right out the sentosa gift shop the signs point left to imbiah station which is wrong. It will lead in a big meaningless around-about walk.
Good way to get across to Sentosa. Great views across the journey. Nice and relaxing good value for money
Fun experience but quite expensive as a mode of transport (use the Singapore Rediscover vouchers if you have them!)
"Booked stargazing dinner with singapore cable car, welcome drink before boarding, 1.5 hrs of 3 full round cable car trip while having dinner, i have salmon set which comes with red wine and coffee. Dont be nervous to finish your food like me as it turned out theres more than enough time to eat in the cabin. Breathtaking view of night scenes, plenty of photo taking in cabin. Staff was fast enough to change my menu at every stop."
"In such an unprecedented moment, traveling suddenly becomes a dream. Good to take a nice joyride in our own town and enjoy what we actually have! I would say not too bad afterall!"
We went on the round trip and it was VERY quiet. Thanks corona virus.Great to glide over the harbour and view the city.Included is the ability to take the Sentosa ride as well - great way to get an inside of the island and a better way to travel in the heat.
Took the cable car over to Sentosa Island. It certainly gives you a different view of this vibrant city. Found the car rather hot despite air conditioning.Had to keep the windows open as the ac wasn't much use.The staff were polite and helpful.
The views are quite nice but there is nothing too special about the ride. If you have time to spare (which was my case) it is worth it ...
"It's a bit awkward to get to from the Harbourside MRT and you have to navigate a reasonable walk, then take a lift to Level 15 of a building in harbourside. Once there, it's easy enough and we simply stayed on the cable car as it did it's loop around Mt Faber and Sentosa. Nice experience."
"First time for a few years saw us use a combo with the Aquarium. No doubting the views , but of great concern was not the CRV19 which was consistently monitored but a more annoying disease of Mobilitus. Apart from one young lady on ticketing a group convened in the corner for a mobile conference totally ingnoring the growing line. Also operational staff seemed to have also contacted the desease. I honestly believe it will only be a matter of time before a safety incident occurs due to the lack of attention and irritating distraction . Please introduce some control over this .Y be a matter of time before an incident occurs due"
"Took the cable car from Faber peak. It's a good trip, lot of good views. My child really enjoyed the trip."
"The two cable cars, to and over the island provide the most amazing views. Singapore is an exceptional place and this is a great way to see some of the incredible projects they have completed. The island has amazing man made beaches and lots of attractions. Well worth the time. A very different side of Singapore."
We got tickets for both lines of the cable cars. This allowed us to get off at each stop and explore. The views were amazing and the ride was pleasant.
Can get very busy so we got there about 9.30am and it was fine. Lovely views. We went up to Mt Fabre too but this was a mistake as the queues were ridiculously long to get back to the port.
The ride is shorter than expected and tends to be expensive given the short time. Check the maintenance dates to avoid disappointments and delays.
This is a great way to go to Sentosa. The souvenir photos they take are just so pricy. A little expensive to go across but it's Singapore....everything is.
"Sentosa is nice to visit, if you like theme parks or water parks. We saw the aquarium, which was nice. The trip over there with the cable car is nice."
"We visited Singapore as part of our cruise around Asia and from research beforehand, we'd decided to have a go on the cable car and take in the views from above.Due to being on a cruise, we were eligible for a 15% discount on the tickets (on production of your cruise passenger card).The views as you can imagine are great (especially on a sunny day!) and, due to going fairly early, it was fairly quiet and we had a cable car to ourselves each time we needed to change. We didn't spend as much time here as we first planned, but it was a nice way to start the day and take in some different views of Singapore. When we left, the queue had started to get quite long so I was pleased we didn't leave it too late.I wouldn't say that it's great value for money, but it's certainly different and a pleasant experience to see things from the sky. I would recommend."
We went with 2 kids (a toddler and a baby) and this was a less stressful way to get to Sentosa without having a hassle to standing in long queues for the Sentosa Express Train or having to be bothered by the weather. The staff also allowed us to wheel the stroller directly into the cable car which was easier and the toddler loved the view !
"The cable car certainly will give you a smooth ride and stunning views. Catching the cable car from Sentosa back to Harbour front was confusing as we needed to change 1/2 way, this part was a little confusing mid way through our ride. Prepare to queue as well as the lines can be quite long"
Nice ride that gets you into Sentosa from harbour front mall. Unlimited and can be bought in combination with the other attractions at Sentosa.
"We used the cable cars and spent the day on senota island. The cable cars were well organised I would buy your ticket on line before you go as the tickets on the island were $10 more. There are other things to do once you get there, if the weather is good spend the day on the beach.When we visited it rained literally as soon as we arrived so we basically just used the cable cars nd did the whole circuit. Some lovely views"
A good ride with less people during the weekdays. able to hop in by myself through out the ride.Good to by the ticket from klook. easy to redeem at the counter.The view from the top is very nice.
"Take the cable car to Sentosa Island, instead of driving. Up, Up and away and look around you at the harbour, the yachts , eating place, look down on the huge water park...well with the trip."
We had a wonderful time going from faber road to sentosa island. Enjoyed the ride. Worth going. But make sure to enjoy the ride weather should be clear
"This is a great way to see the bay, harbour and get a sense of how Singapore is oriented to the sea. Signage could be better The young people working loading and unloading people from the cars could do a much better job of explaining how the towers are arranged and how to get to and from each point. They did not act at all interested in helping us resolve confusion."
"The most scenic way to get to Sentosa Island with stunning views. Great views of Gardens by the Bay. My third trip to Singapore, but the first time I've been to Sentosa Island and it is well worth it."
Singapore Cable Car is a perfect way to watch Singapore. It is also a good transportation medium to enter Sentosa .
"The Faber Mt. cable car not only gave us a fantastic view of Singapore, but also provided our perfect connection for hiking on Faber Peak and the Henderson Wave. We chose to stay on Sentosa Island for a few days as a base for our Singapore visit. We took the cable car from Sentosa to Mount Faber. Upon exiting at The Mount Faber station, we began our planned day hike of Faber Peak, where there is another Merlin Lion statue and a fantastic view of the harbor. From the peak, it was a seem less transition to Henderson Waves, and other key hiking locations in Singapore."
The Cable Car experience was fantastic. The service received and staff were wonderful. Have to experience it!
The cable cars were clean and efficient and we spent the day travelling backwards and forwards. The views are really good and we never had to wait too long. They aren't cheap though!
We went to the cable car and we had lots of fun. I bought a fridge magnet and a teddy bear key chain. It was an unforgettable day.
"The view is great, and a great little ride to get to the Island of Fun. Lots to see and do. Plus you can use your ticket to take the Island Cable Cars to get around from one end to the other too. Well worth the money."
can see Sentosa island from bird eyes view. Night time can see USS's fireworks from there.i feel safe inside cable car and take a lot of photo inside the car.i really have fun time :)
We had been to the cable cars in Langkawi and I knew this was not going to be the same. I paid SGD 120 for 2 Adults and 2 children which is very steep. The cable cars are clean and well maintained you get amazing views of Sentosa Island and The Waterfront it's the kind of thing you might try once the kids loved it though. They also have dinning packages were you can have a meal while you enjoy the views which seems like a great option for couples but with children just riding the cable cars was fun enough just wished it was cheaper.
"If you are in the mood to quickly look at all that Sentosa had to offer, the cable cars are a must! The scenery is breathtaking! One small sad thing though, the ""Explorer Passports"" for the kids were so difficult to find that we gave up! The kids were very disappointed."
"We decided to take the cable car from Harborfront to Sentosa only, but as the price included a return trip, we ended up taking the cable car back off the island.To get there, you need to walk through Harborfront shopping complex, which is right next to Vivo City. You walk past the area where the cruise passengers disembark and follow the signs outside into the next building, where the cable cars are located.It's very peaceful up above the harbor and island as the cable car rolls along. You do hear the odd clank or grind as it rolls along and it does sway a little when the wind picks up.The views are fantastic - you can see very far on either side of the harbour and you also get a great view of most of the island and it's resorts as you fly over.The trip takes less than 10 minutes and drops you off at the gift shop on the island.When you purchase your cable car tickets (or monorail ticket from Sentosa Express) you can purchase tickets for all the activities on Sentosa and it gives you slight discounts on each ticket as you combine more and more."
The cable car is a great way to see the harbour front views and to get to and from Sentosa island .i took the Sentosa express monorail to Sentosa and did the cable car on the return journey Which suited me .
For someone who is a bit afraid of heights this sure was exhilarating. The ride itself is comfortable and feels safe but it does go very high. You can see some great views of Sentosa Island from here and of the city behind you but not any major sites like Marina Bay as it's not in the same area. Great way to get over to the island but does have a steep price of $35.
Try the cable car from city to Sentosa Island. No trafic not much of a waiting time. It was worth the price. They'll take your photo and try to sell it from the other side. It is really common in Sentosa Island. It is just a way of income so we have to accept it. Don't forget to cover the full route on cable car. Ask from someone there where you can travel with the ticket you have. You can go to Sentosa and also to the other side on of the island on the same ticket and return to where you started in most of the cases.
"Although there was smoke from Indonesia to limit the view, I was able to see the beautiful sunset, and enjoy the night view."
"We took the cable car into Sentosa and back again. Its a short journey, but the views are great both during the day and at night. The cable car on Sentosa is also a nice way to see the whole island."
Take a trip out to PUNGGOL. Catch the MRT which takes you into a Mega Shopping Centre. Walk through and down some stunning walks along the river. Lots of history plaques along the route. Tranquil and interesting. Another trip (if you are into Shopping) is BOON LAY...some of the outer suburbs offer much more than the Standard Orchard Road.
Buy the $33AU ticket which entitles you to a trip to Mt Faber and back to Sentosa Island ad well as a ride on the cable car across the island. Best to ride on a clear day.
"Taking the cable car from Mount Faber to Sentosa island is a great way to see a different view of Singapore. Tickets are $35 at the gate however we purchased ours through Booking.com for $24.50.On the island there are lots of tourist sites (universal studios, aquarium, beach clubs, Merlion ....). Buy the round trip ticket and it includes the second cable car ride to Siloso point. Currently there is a Star Wars themed sand sculpture exhibition plus international competition on the beach which is well worth a look.There is a free train from the center of Sentosa back to the mainland if the return cable car trip is not your preference."
Good way to go from mainland to Sentosa. Very comfortable. Great views of beach and ground attractions.
We hadnt travelled on a cable car before ...as it was obviously newer than others that we had seen that was the first tick ... we found it very efficient and of course a great view particularly over Sentosa Island and in particular the beaches.
"Good experience, with value ticket discount.Popular but not crowded, even on a Sunday afternoon. Went from Harbour Front to Sentosa by monorail and back by cable car."
"Cable car is good and clean. The entry is a bit hectic. I arrived by MRT and it took me sometime to find the entry. Ticket line felt like out of Singapore (long and not as quick). Beautiful and clean, but not as organised. I would recommend a ride for good views and pictures."
Decided to go to Sentosa via Mount Faber..Took the cable car from Mount Faber for the 3 of us and the feeling was awesome...Quite windy when you are hanging in the air. Good experience for small children....We can even see what is on the Cruise when you are travelling on top of it. But i heard the New Model of Able Car are much more better. Worth the experience.
"The cable car is a great way to get to Sentosa and Mt Faber, and see a bit of Singapore on the way over. Great for kids. It's well worth exploring on the Mt Faber side of the cable car if you have time, before you head back down.The cars do get really hot on a hot day, so I'd avoid the hotter part of the day if possible."
Price at $135 for a family is like buying a full trip tickets for all 4 to 5 of us and it allows us to travel unlimited time as a family to view the beautiful scenery. Only bad point is parking is very limited for weekend.
My kids alway wanted me to bring them for a cable car ride but I find it expensive and to just go for a round trip. Brought them to the cable car station last week to see how cable car works. We had a long walk from the Mount Faber. By the time they make it to the top I think they are too tired to ask for a trip.
"We enjoyed our day riding the cable car and swimming at Siloso beach. Stopped in for coconut ice cream before our swim, then enjoyed each leg of the cable car ride. Highly recommended. Don't get caught out though - it is one price for natives and a higher price for tourists."
"I did both the cable cars from Santosa Island and was extremely impressed, both with the view and the way they are laid out. A little scary at the high spots but well worth the trip. You can also get off and back on at various intervals to explore further,"
"What a better way of an aerial view of the Southern part of Singapore than from a cable car! We saw fantastic views of the southern waterfront, the awesome architectural characters of the buildings around it, the economic & social activities below & Sentosa Island with its boundless attractions. The area is vibrant even on a weekday, theming with locals & tourists having a good time! The loop system of cable cars from 3 key points- Harbourfront, Mount Faber & Sentosa make good sense & offers satisfying bird's eye view."
We enjoyed cable car from Mt Faber. We changed to the Siloso line and on the way back had lunch before taking the cable car back to Mt Faber.
"I'm not a fan of cable cars but this was the smoothest ride I've ever been on.We thought it was expensive as we only wanted to travel over to Sentosa & return - the cost was Singapore $35 each. However, there are additional cable car rides included in the ticket price."
"The cable car is a great way to travel over to Sentosa from Mount Faber, lovely view. Visit the toilets before you get on the cable car, fab view from there with all glass front. A loo with a view! Be aware that when returning to Mount Faber there is no taxi rank. We had to walk all the way down the hill to the main road and then figure out which way to get a bus. You cannot flag a taxi down as it is dual carriageway and they are not allowed to stop in bus stops. It took 2 hours for us to get back to our hotel which is only a 15 minute drive away."
"The kids were complaining that they hadn't been on the Cable Car for a while, so we decided to get another membership. It would have been more sensible to renew the previous membership when it expired as the renewal rates are lower, but we didn't quite get around to it. Still, it's not bad value for $135 for a year for a family of 4. Luckily our youngest is still below the threshold level of 4 years of age - otherwise it's a full adult membership rate to add him to the package. THe membership deal isn't quite as good as it used to be - no longer get free access by car or by train to Sentosa, only by cable car."
Not a big fan of cable cars but this was amazing very smooth and wonderful views well worth the money.
A Cable Car connection Faber Peak to Harbour Point to Sentosa Island. One-Way Cable car is must. There are 2 Cable Car Routes. It is fun !!!
"I done this one time, its office is located behind the aquarium. It was safe and i got a nice view. Recommended but it doesn't go very high"
travel in cable car from mount faber to Santosa its nice experience to move on rope over the singapore.
We took the cable car to reach Sentosa. Overall the ride was nice and you get good view of the city and Sentosa from the top. Kids really enjoyed the ride.
"We caught bus out to Sentosa island which was only S$3 for two people and just looked around the shops and had lunch. Cable car was I think around S$35 each but that gave you a few rides to different areas and also across to the Mt Faber where we had a Singapore Sling in the cafe built around a tree and back to the Harbour where we caught a taxi home, The view was interesting and different to the Sky Park."
"We took the ride from the Harbourfront shopping centre rather than Faber Peak, but it was a nice ride, good views, didn't last too long. Cars had good viewing windows to take photos (unlike the cable car on Sentosa - that one has decals all along the viewing space!)I'm always up for a cable car and was glad we got to do this one."
You can take cable car ride to sentosa island from mount Faber peak. The ride is quick and offer views of Singapore sky line and sea fronts. You cross channel and reach sentosa island by this ride.
We had a morning to fill in before our flight and this was a very pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. It wasn't busy so we had the cable car to ourselves each time. Very nice views. We didn't spend any length of time on Sentosa but it looked as though you could do just about anything!
"We actually walked across the bridge to get to Sentosa Island but decided to take the scenic route back via the Singapore Cable Car.You can purchase tickets at various booths that are well marked, and our trip cost $33 each.We did round trips on both legs, purely to get an aerial view of the island, and as part of our tourist experience.Lines can be long, and the cars seat 8 so you won't get a car to yourself, but it was a good experience and I really enjoyed seeing the other parts of this resort island.I think it was well worth it, it added to our day!"
"Bought a 1-day pass for Singapore + Sentosa Island cable cars, to explore the island. I'd say it was worth the price, as the views were quite good, even though not as impressive as you can get at the bay. Still not bad at all. Stations are located in strategic points from which you can walk around and explore the area. I'd say cabins are a bit dated, and windows start to hinder photo opportunities, and in general they feel a bit too closed to truly enjoy the surroundings. Nevertheless, it's fun!Keep in mind that if you are taking it from the Mt Faber station (and returning there), then be sure you can call up a taxi (or know your bus routes), otherwise transport there is a bit scarce... Other option is to go to the Promenade station and take a train ride (or a taxi) from there."
My little boys were very happy and excited with the experience of cable car. Security ok. Little difficult to find starting pls for new comers.
Did the cable car from Sentosa Island and had lunch and drinks at Mt Faber. Caught it back down later in the afternoon. It's something you should really do when in Singapore.
"What can I say, the Singapore Cable Car is a great place to grab a view of Singapore and Sentosa Island from. It's also a great way to escape from the heat of the day. The only downside for us was when we reached the Mt Faber station about 5 bus loads of people had just been dropped there to catch the Cable Car, thus we walked back to the train station via the stairway."
"Caught the cable car across to the island. great views and very quiet. Once you get to the islan not well sign posted and poor toilets at the top, use the ones at the resort area."
"We enjoyed riding the Cable Car, seeing almost the whole Sentosa area and be able to see the glimpse of what are we going to explore next.. Our ride is a little bit hot because of summer and late in the afternoon, but definitely is fun."
Day or night the view from the Cable Car is wonderful. Don't be afraid the ride is smooth and easy and over before you know it.
"Would have been a 5* review if not for the price tag that comes with the Cable car rideThe ride itself is amazing. We started from the Mount Faber and went all the way to the Sentosa Station. The views from the Mount Faber to Harbourfront are amazing and so are the views from Harbourfront to Sentosa station.Between the Harbourfront and Sentosa, the car goes to its highest point that provides a nice birds eye view of the entire Sentosa Island. From here, you can see the Universal Studios, Water park, Merlion, etc. This is the best part of the rideThe other line (Imbiah - Sentosa - Siloso) offers an excellent view of the beach side of the Sentosa Island. It is a good way to go to the Siloso point and Siloso Fort.Overall, the ride itself is enjoyable, but for many the cost would be a deal breaker.One way takes about 20 minutes (Mount Faber to Sentosa) and 10 minutes (Imbiah to Siloso)"
Good fun and you dont have to share with strangers. . Outstanding views for photos and a good gentle ride. Would definitely recommend. Reasonably priced and a must do.
Used this to get from Harbour Front to Sentosa Island and back. Get some good views of the area and surrounds as you go across. Also rode the second line on the island and get some great views of the beach area on Sentoas. Well worth the money.
"Not worth the money , expensive. No one way, forced to buy the full ticket. Handling of groups and crowds not great, perhaps to many tourists and business is good but people need to be treated with courtesy."
We took the return cable car ride that included Mt Faber and Sentosa lines. It is an enjoyable way to see vistas of Singapore. It is a good 2+ hour activity where you cover major parts of Mt Faber and Sentosa.
"The visit to Sentosa island starts with this cable car ride.Pre tickets prevents the line up on top of the mountain, with short waiting time to enter cable car.Great experience and views over bay and looking down on cruise ship docked.. The second cable car on the island takes you to the beach area and main entertainment."
Take the cable car in order to have an airview of the city and Santosa islands.These islands are less quite than previously.
"A lovely way to get down to Sentosa, which appears to have changed beyond all recognition over the past few years.Getting back to the hotel though can be a very long wait for a taxi,Might be advisable to book it by phone."
"We purchased the cable ride with our tickets for Universal Studio's so we got a discount. We had a all day pass, so we made use of the cable cars."
"Like everything in Singapore, quite expensive if you include the additional SEA Aquarium trip as a package...Not sure this turned out much cheaper. You have unlimited rides back and forth on a few stations. We shared one trip with a small group of french travellers who couldnt stop chatting - no big deal.We couldnt be bothered coming back to downtown Singapore by cable car so took a cab - which was quicker and cooler. The tickets are a set price as there is no one way ticket available."
"Unlike some reviewers, i found that as it was quiet, I only shared 1 of my 3 journeys with another person. The views were great and really demonstrated that singapore is a major port and sentosa is singapore's blackpool!"
we took a taxi to the top to catch the cable car from Faber Peak over to Sentosa island. what an amazing view! stopping off at the shopping centre station along the way - the cable car was a smooth and gentle ride with amazing views! It was just he two of us in the cable car so that was nice to get to share that experience together as a couple and not be crammed in like sardines as we had experienced at other places. would highly recommend getting to Sentosa via the cable car! its a great view of all of the exciting things that Sentosa Island has to offer!
Went for the views from the cable car which were very good altho not cheap (Â£35 for 2) Sentosa itself seemed very dated and overdue a facelift but the gardens at Faber Peak are lovely
"We took the cable car to go to Sentosa island. The gondola lift took us on a breath taking trip over the bay into Sentosa. The view was awe inspiring. It was a spectacular sight to see the Singapore landscape and a bird's eye view of the Sentosa island.As it was 2 pm the sun was blazing. Inside the cable car, it was stifling. Wish there was AC."
You can take this modern Cable Car all the way up to Mount Faber Peak and obtain great views of the vast docks and South Coast of the main island. You can then return via your starting point to Sentosa Island and enjoy all that's on offer there.
"This is a ""must do"" while in Singapore but allow yourself at least a half a day, there is so much to see and do. The views from the cable cars are amazing. Get off at each stop and have a look around. When you get to Sentosa take the time to have a good look around. (There is a water park and a mini theme park , if you are going to either of these give yourself a full day)"
"We decided to take the longer ride from Mount Faber and it was worth the view going into Sentosa,We got late so missed the return journey which we wanted to see how the city looksOne should take it"
One of the easy ways to get to Sentosa and cheap. The views back to Singapore will keep you busy and entertained. Catch Cable car over and flyer back
Was impressed with how easy it was to use the cable car . Tickets and information at kiosk helpful . Happy to give every couple or family their own cable so no sharing with strangers . Pleasant 10 mins with beautiful views .
The cable car was good but Santosa Island was awful. They could have done a lot better. The beaches are good but the amusement park did not match what the island should be
We got tickets on klook site which were a lot cheaper than walk up prices and voucher was easy to exchange. Cable cars were a great way to visit Sentosa Island and the views are really nice. We were lucky and they were not crowded as we did go quite early and you could see the queues getting longer later in the day. Great way to see Sentosa also as the ticket includes a trip on there also.
We took cable car to Santosa Island just for the view and were not disappointed. Cable car is air conditioned.Can be busy and takes I think up to 8 people.
"We were on holiday amd for a ride to Sentosa island and if you are visiting Singapore the cable car is a ""must do"" trip. If you really want to go wild you could take the VIP dinner ride a night as well."
"This is a must do. There are two main cable cars plus a myriad of other offerings. It is the best way to see the Merlion and the airconditioned comfort of your gondola is a great way to beat the heat. We had gondolas to ourselves all day, not sure it would be as much fun if they filled up with the maximum eight people."
"Worth a round trip if Sentosa is in your schedule . Youll get an amazing view ,its either $35 or $38 if im correct and for the latter youll get the full round tour of all 3 cable cars. If you are just after a view, Mt Faber wil suffice."
"A lovely way to get to Sentosa island with lovely views, queues Went down quite quickly, pods take up to 6 people"
"From a kid, I love cable car, but Singapore's is a bit expensive and shorter ride as compared to many area in Asia. We found a cheaper way is to buy a family membership. Same price as a cable car ride but can use for 1 full year. So good options if you want to come with your family."
"not cheap, to be honest but worth the money! one can step out and walk around the forest park with lots of food/drink"
Best way to visit Sentosa . Great views from the cars and you feel very safe . Even our mum at 82 enjoyed it
Nice way to get to Sentosa and to see the island from above. Birds eye views of the harbour. Lots of stops where you can get off and explore.
A little more expensive since our last visit to Singapore but always a worth the time and money. Pick a clear day if you plan to go on the cable car.
"We stayed on Sentosa so figured may as well pay the big bucks and cable back home, we knew the price so was prepared, location in tower 2 at HarbourFront had me lost for 30 mins but once I found it, straight forward and a different perspective on the harbour and Sentosa"
From off of Sentosa Island to going to Sentosa Station to Beach Point it a really nice ride. Little expensive but what not in Singapore. You can walk or take the train on the island but you are here to enjoy your day.
"Undoubtly it's an amaging experiance. If any one wants to go to santosa island or universal studio, must avail the cable car. You will definitely enjoy when it will go over the sea. While after sunset some may find it quite scarry, because it be all around dark; specially when paasing over the sea. Overall I will strongly recomend it to all."
"A little on the expensive side but the views are quite impressive. Its also a good way of getting around the island and if you like, back to the mainland."
"Great fun runs from Faber Road across to Sentosa Island, great views and a great way to get to Sentosa"
"This Cable car system links Singapore with this ""compact island"" with many interesting attractions-- Sentosa- located off the South Shore. The system started operating 45 years ago-- and has had several upgrades and redesigns as the demand, and technology, evolved. The ""ride"" takes about 15 minutes-- and the views of Sentosa Island, ""Mount Faber"", Vivo City and Marina Bay and Environs are super!! It also connects with the transit system on Sentosa Island. TripAdvisor has designated this attraction the highly respected ""Traveller's Choice"" award. It is indeed very worthy of the award.I hope that this Review has been helpful."
"Offers a great alternative getting into Sentosa. Views of the straits are spectacular and is a fun mode of transport. It is pricey, but we included this as part of our HIPPO pass"
"Best timing to take the cable car is around sunset. You can enjoy the amazing view en-route Sentosa island. However, I feel the cable car station in Harbourfront is located a bit far or quite distant from the MRT station. Gets confusing to find out the station for tourists/people not from Singapore"
We enjoyed travelling across to Sentosa on the Cable Car. It has fantastic views of both Singapore and Sentosa Island. We would have returned on it also however there was a storm so we caught the train.It's definitely worth doing across to Sentosa as it provides you with fabulous views of the island.
What a nice way to see the huge city of Singapore. We had a round trip and lookes around at all stations.
I will rate this experience as good and one time experience. For this you also have a waiting time of around 45 minutes. You can save that time by going through road as well. But if you want to enjoy the scenic view of sentosa and it's neighbourhood you can take one way cable car. It is hardly of 10-15 minutes ride but you could be able to see many beautiful things from this ride
"I took 4 ways cable car. It was awesome experience. Got bird's-eye view of entire Sentosa and key attractions of Singapore. I suggest one should take 4 way cable car route instead of 2 ways. Ideally one should visit around 5-5.30pm. So one can visit part of cable car in day time and partly after sunset and get both day and night view. I did same. As view from cable car was very good I skipped Singapore flyer. Only negative feedback was, we were asked to change cable car in middle of trip as staff wanted to use our cable car for candle lite dinner for other couple. We had to take out our kids, stroller and luggage from one cable car and rushed to another cable car. It dampened our overall experience. Else entire journey was very good."
Today I had the chance for a round trip on the cable car.. my kids enjoyed a lot .. they really wanted to go again .. the joyful I saw in them .. can not be expressed in pages and pages .. wish u all the best
highly recommended at least once every 5-10 years to enjoy the trip to Sentosa on a slow afternoon! The view is fantastic. The other alternate is the cable ride within Sentosa itself.
We had the chance to experience the Singapore Cable Car on our trip to Sentosa Island to visit Universal Studios. The wait in line was not long at all. We were able to experience a great 360 degree view of the surrounding area. Seeing the Merlion from there was great. Hong Kong has cable cars too but the experience in Singapore was has a breath taking!
Great experience to see how beautiful Singapore is while riding in Cable Car. Dont miss this on your travel list.
Excellent!! You get a round ticket for around $25 then can get on and off at each station once. Closest MRT is Harbour Front. Plenty to see for free or plenty of adventures to be had for $$.NB: Don't buy electronic tickets as you have to them redeem them at the ticket window for a paper ticket anyway. I purchased mine through here (Viator/Trip Advisor) however the ticket office didn't recognise the barcode. I had to ring Viator and request for a different form of barcode. Bit of a hassle.
Riding on the cable car is one of the special experience. You get a 360Â° View from a great height. Watching the city with River view while riding towards the Sentosa Island is just amazing. Must have this experience
"An enjoyable activity that can be done with kids.We took a round trip ride from Harbour Front station to Sentosa during sunset. The views all around were beautiful.Spent a couple of hours at Sentosa island. Took the cable car ride back from Sentosa to Harbour Front after dark. This also was a very good experience given that the buildings, Vivo City Mall and the various vessels in the sea are lighted up."
Easy to get to from Harbour Front station and use the Mount Faber line to reach Sentosa island. Comfortable and modern but a few more fans or air-con would help the journey to be more enjoyable.
"Picked up the cable car from harbourside MTR which is well signposted when getting off the train. Lift to 15th floor then ride across to Sentosa Island. The views are amazing paramamacilly and looking down over the water, if not s little scary. The cars are large and clean. We were lucky as early in day you could travel as a couple, the crowds came later and cars were full with 8 people. We went to the beach by transferring to other cars and on way back went up to Mount Faber.Cost 35 dollar each was not cheap but worth the views."
The cable car was so great if you want to see Singapore from the view. There are 3 stations that you can hop in and hop off. Good experience. A relaxing one.
"All the places visited were neat and clean. Most of the entertainment was fun, and enjoyable. Worth a visit"
Nothing out of the ordinary but an interesting way to get to Sentosa Island. A little expensive so I wpould recommend the free rail shuttle for families
This is a nice thing to do when you are a Tourist. However the tickets are very expensive. It would be nice if the Singapore Tourism reduces the prices. It is a beautiful ride to Sentosa. Worth it. However if you are a budget traveller you can skip this one.
Top views of the harbour and a great way to get to Sentosa Island. It was easy and affordable and felt very safe. Highly recommended.
Very good experience to see a nice chunk of Singapore from above. Prices drop after 18:00. Else would have found it expensive
"This is the original cable car, connecting Mount Faber with Sentosa via Harbourfront. Views are always good and it's fun for the kids. I have to say I'm getting a little sick of it now after too many times, but have to keep the kids happy."
We caught the cable car across to Sentosa Island for the day. They are quite large cable cars with several stops to Sentosa. It was enjoyable to sit back and take in the views.
We didn't pre purchase tickets so queued and paid full price including a little extra to ride the cable cars on Sentosa Island. You can get ticket packages that include some of the attractions on the Island. Sentosa Island appears to be the theme park side of Singapore with Universal Studios and waterparks etc.The ride across is 15mins or so and the views are super. If you get on at Harbour Front you can ride up to Faber mountain and then ride down through the skyscaper.There are cheaper ways to get to the island!
"The route covers a distance of 1.65km from Mount Faber to Sentosa Island passing though a high rise building at Harbour Front Station, and takes 15 minutes. The cost is S$29.90 for the return trip but pay S$35.00 and the fee includes the Sentosa Line. Pricey, but not something that you do everyday and you do get some great views. We were lucky to have a gondola to ourselves for each leg so managed to get some great photos without having to worry about other passengers. Staff are very helpful and the rides were an enjoyable experience."
"Cable car to the Sentosa was one of the unforgettable experience of my life, it was fun to trade and its being my first time on cable car it was really mesmerised me and the view from the cable car was superb and breathtaking at some points. everyone should experience at least once in a life... must try."
Visited on 18/10/18 we are a mature couple with Grown up children so visited on our own at this quiet time of year experience was very good no queues to get on cable cars or any other transportTicket cost 35 sing dollars per adult no discount for seniors this included the car up to the top we then got another car to go round the island and backFrom there we took the sky train to sentosa beach and a little trolly bus along the beach front (both free once you have your tickets)stopping for drinks at one of the beaches which again were desertedWe traveled from the orchard rd MRT via dhoby ghaut to harbour front where we purchased our tickets (MRT is very easy to use especially with everyone being so helpful)NB PURCHASE YOUR TICKETS ON LINE IF YOU CAN AS IT SAVES YOU MONEY COST 24.50 sing dollars per adult saving more than 10 dol per adult
If you want to have a beautiful view of the city of Singapore you must go to take this cable car which facilitates also the access for Sentosa island and Mount Faber . If you chose to go there take the ticket which will allowed to visit also Aquarium . Deserve every cent ! Have fun !
"Enjoyed the rides with views from the sky! Sentosa great place to hang out. There are many things to see and do below ground as well. If you visit Singapore, a must do. The best thing about it was the small crowd made access easy and fun."
Purchased a two attraction and unlimited cable car ride ticket for 2 adults and 2 children. Cost $200 Singaporean dollars at the desk. It was good value as individually we would have paid more. Went up the Merlion and also the 50 storey lookout. Kids loved it. Easy access and great to use the cable car network.
"It seems to be often under maintenance, so I would not recommend pre-booking tickets. The ride itself is very short both ways, Mt. Faber or Sentosa. Good for taking photos daytime, though.Alternatively, you can just take a cab or hike on top of Mt. Faber via Southern Ridges (free) or take the monorail to Sentosa (S$4)."
"This is one activity one should not miss while in Singapore. Great views, friendly staff, nice souvenir shop. Too bad the Sentosa line was closed for maintenance otherwise I would have rated it as 5/5."
This was a fun way to see another view of Singapore. The cable car is not a particularly long ride but it was fun and a good way to get to Sentosa island. Worth a ride
"No need to pre-purchase tickets as the ride is fairly popular but cable cars are continually available. Took the cable car rides from Sentosa and return rather than to Sentosa (we went to Sentosa on the MRT ... great, cheap and convenient). Provides great views of mainland Singapore and towards Sentosa Island. Highly recommend doing the trip at dusk so you get the combination of late afternoon sun and lighting from the buildings, roads & attractions."
There are some things that you must experience once and thats that. The Cable Car is worth that one experience even if it is just a 10 minute ride with a waiting time of 10-15 minutes or worse if there are large tour groups at the same time as you. The best way to do it is to take a one way ride from Mount Faber Station to Sentosa Station or beyond. That ensure that you fly over the harbour and enter into Sentosa which is the most scenic part of the ride. It also means that you cross at least one stop and get sufficient time on the ride.The cable car moves at a fairly slow and even pace. Those afraid of heights might feel uncomfortable especially while looking down. But my 3 year old son could handle it so it shouldn't pose too much of a risk to anyone. A one way ride is enough - you do want to see the harbour sights and also the Sentosa attraction from above. A return ride may not be very enjoyable as you would be moving upwards instead of downwards.
"Riding on singapore Cable car is a wonderful experience. It gives a birds eye view of Universal Studio, the port, Sentosa Island and lot more"
"We took the cable car as part of trip to Universal studios. Unfortunately, we did not buy the photo that was taken of us at the time by the company and when I tried to buy it via email a few days later I was advised that photos are only retained for 24 hours. My fault, but very disappointing.The cable car itself is fun and offers great views across Singapore and into Sentosa Island. It is quite expensive for what it is which was the reason I did not want to buy the also expensive photo earlier just in case I ran out of money!My suggestion is that if you can afford it, then definitely take the cable car as it is a great experience so would recommend it."
one of the ways to travel to the sentosa island...quite amazing views from up there...there is a Queue though..it travels at a leisurely pace...
"Excellent views of port, city and Sentosa Island. For an extra $2 you got to ride the cable car on the island too."
"Highly efficnient and a very comfortable ride. We rode the whole cablecar network, up to Faber Peak, then down to Sentosa Island, then switched cable lines to the Merlion and to Fort Silosa. Fantastic views whever you look."
This is a great way to see some of Singapore from above. You can go through Santosa Island and you can go from Santosa Island to Singapore.
Went on the cable car after a day in universal studios. Great views and a lovely way to relax and take in the views we only wanted to go across the bay but had to buy a return trip . Good job too as the are no taxis or even the Grab a taxi in sight nice restaurants at the viewing point though
"It's a novelty.... if you're not too sure whether you should do it maybe don't, but if you do, you'll have an OK time."
"From Mount Faber, the cable car runs to Sentosa Island and is the most fun way of reaching there. You can see the Marina the ships, the docks, the entire port, the fun area of the Sentosa Park. Its totally worth the trip, if you are deciding to go or not."
"If you haven't done a cabe car before, this is well worth the experience. We were staying on Sentosa, so thought this was a good option for getting off the island, and having a look around the city. We bought our tickets online, only an hour before we boarded, and got round-trip tickets (2 adults, and a child), for S$62. That was round-trip for both lines.There are two lines, the Faber line takes you from Sentosa over to Mt Faber and back. The other line focuses on Sentosa itself, with some sightseeing across the island. Other reviewers will tell you that if you require to get back to Singapore CBD by taxi, it's best to alight at Harbourfront Station. That was our plan - we originally planned to go to Mt Faber, have a look around, and then go back to Harbourfront to get a taxi, however a bus load of tourists arrived at the wrong time, and the lines to get back on at Faber were huge, so we called a taxi (Grab taxi), and they picked us up from Mt Faber in a couple of minutes, and was only S$11 to get into Lau Pa Sat market.There isn't any audio in the cable cars to tell you exactly what you are looking towards, so we just made up our own stories. The cable car seats 6-8 people, and is safe, and doesn't sway like other cable cars I've been on.The experience is open from 8:45 AM to 10 PM. The last boarding will be at 9:30 PM"
A20 minutes ride over the Marin. Start in the forest. Very nice view of Santa's and the hills. Recommended.
Got our ticket included in the Singapore Stopover package. Views are amazing and it is a good way to rest your legs while looking at the scenery.
"The cable car isn't that special, but the views at the top of Mt Faber are. The price drops after 6pm for those watching their budget, though personally I think going up via cable car at 5pm would be perfect. When you get to the top, get out of the tourist complex and head towards Henderson Waves Bridge, and then spend a couple of hours wandering through the tracks and pedestrian walkways at the top and watch the sunlight fade and Singapore's lights come on, while meandering through both National Park tracks and formal gardens, Do the former before the light fades; these don't have street lamps and are more interesting when you can still see the birds and other wildlife. We didn't see any monkeys but could hear them."
Went up here at night where adults pay a child's price ($22 round trip). Good view of the bay and city skyline as well as the various coloured lights.
Buy return pass to visit all stations twice. Easy to navigate around sentosa island if you have the pass.
Its a good experience for children who have never got the chance to ride a cable car before. The view was fantastic and the ride was comfortable. Getting on and off was easy even for a 6 yo.Recommended if you have the budget to arrive to the island memorably considering other alternative of transport to the island is much cheaper.
"Great way to see Singapore, but it appears that even on fairly windless days, the cars can be a bit rocky. I had to sit in the middle so I wasn't causing the car to rock too much. Glad I did it though"
"Me and my family took the cable car from the main point and took the cable car to Sentosa Island, one of the stops this car goes through. It was smooth and quiet, no complaints from me."
"The views were not as 'amazing' as I expected, but it was still worth it. The evening dining option looked interesting...."
I went on this cable car with my wife on our honeymoon in April 2017 right after spending a day at Paramount theme park. It was a welcome chill out after all that waking around & going on rides.You get to see beach resorts & lots of other places from above & it cuts down on your transport fare back to your hotel if your hotel isn't near by.
Took my elderly Mum on this cable car and we both enjoyed the experience. The boarding was easy and it didn't take too long on the lineup.
A fun thing to do although not overly cheap but that's to be expected in tourist towns.Weekends are very busy but weekdays are not so bad and we had a car to ourselves.Beware! Trying to get a cab back from there in nigh on impossible. Be prepared to ring for one at the taxi stand.
"Nice experience it was while travelling in this to go to Sentosa island. Ofcourse, the stunning views are something to cherish"
"We did the entire round trip from Faber peak to Sentosa and back, but got off at the Harbour front tower as we were told its' easier to get taxis back to the city from there. Except long queues though, but the shopping is great at the mall at the ground level."
"The view from the cable car was beautiful. When we went, the queues were not too long so the four of us were able to get in a car without anyone else. The round trip is really nice as you can get off whenever you'd like to, to look around and get back on."
"Sentosa Cable car is a good way to travel in and out of Sentosa. It costs you $33 , however at the entrance you can avail combo offers with SEA or Universal Studio.Combo offers give you unlimited rides. The substitute to the Cable car is the Sentosa express which costs only $4 however you can also try that for free once your inside Sentosa. I would recommend spending extra for the unlimited cable car ride as you can go from on spot to another in no time."
it was a bit scary as it is really highworth a trip up to Mount Faber and then to the end of Sentosa
"You can take the Cable Car or train to Sentosa Island. I started by taking the cable car to the Island, then traveled on the Cable car over the island, stopping as I made my way round. Then on the way home took the cable car back.Good idea if visiting Universal Studios"
Cable car was fantastic. The 360* view was just mind blowing. Especially on the Sentosa island trail and above the cruise. You surely wouldn't find similar views anywhere in Singapore except for the cable car. It was a good ride and a wonderful experience watching over the cityscape.
Cable car to sentosa. The ride allows us to have a paranomic view of the waterfront of western Singapore.
The cable car ride especially if you make use of one of the many discounts available on many sites makes for an enjoyable way to get a birds eye view of the mainland across to Sentosa Island. This ride coupled with the cable car on Sentosa is a fun activity. On the day we visited being a Sunday the ride was never heavily patronised meaning that there were no queues and more often than not as we boarded and alighted at the different stations the two of us had a car to ourselves.
"Tickets: We bought a Universal Studio+Aquarium+Cable Car combination ticket online. Buying tickets online beforehand did not help skip the queue. We had to stand in the same line as everyone else (who are buying tickets) to redeem tickets/vouchers. In fact we felt that people buying tickets on the counter got better bargain/discounts and free gifts while we just got a paper version of our tickets redeemed.Directions: While arriving from VivoCity we found directions to the starting point bit tricky. It also involved significant walking while we had to keep an eye on the signage.Review: The cable cars are one of three transport options to get to the Sentosa island. The cable cars were clean and at all the stops the cars came quite frequently. We never had to wait more than 30 seconds for a ride. So it's safe, fast, efficient, the views are pleasant and unlike monorail it does not get crowded. The cable car also goes to Siloso point which otherwise can only be reached by taxi or on foot."
"the views from the cable cars are great, you can see all the way around the islands, we toured on all of the cars & saw some amazing sights, it was a very hot day & the cars were still reasonable cool."
"Caught the Cable Car from the Harbour Front Station up to Mount Faber. Walked around for 30 minutes admiring the beauty of the forest area on the mountain. Then rode the Cable Car all the way down to Sentosa Island. The whole operation is well run with the cable cars themselves looking very new, and as with everything in Singapore, very clean. Being mostly glass everyone gets a clear view during the trip.I highly recommend you take a ride!"
Kids enjoy it and you get good view of Sentosa island from top. You can get great pictures during sunset time.
This is a great way to transit to Sentosa Island. Fantastic views across Singapore and Sentosa. Also an excellent way to return from Sentosa.If you are flying Singapore Airlines and have access to a Singapore Explorer Pass this is included and is well worth the time.
My family and I enjoyed an amazing trip from Universal studios and back. We had nice views of Sentosa island and surroundings...It's a must when going in Singapore. Be careful with young children...
"My family and I caught the cable car to sentosa. My 8yo thought it was great! Although it is abit pricey, it is one of those must do tourist attractions while in Singapore"
It is fabulous while you ride through cable car it is over view of Santosa Island Universal studio and overview of whole singapore
"We used the monorail system to cross to Sentosa and decided to travel back by cable car. When purchasing ticket for return we were told that we had to purchase a full return ticket so by travelling by cable car over and back is the best option. The cable car gave us the opportunity of being able to have a great view of city and port but we found that we had to stop and change to another station to complete our journey, but it was entirely worth it."
"I boarded in the middle of the 2 directions it goes. It is super high up for amazing views of the seaport and the surrounding islands and straits. It is very safe now, but I am not so much one for dramatic heights. Even so you should do it just for the all encompassing views. When you get to one of the islands there is a another small network of more cable cars, and if you buy the combined ticket all these routes are included."
"Great value for money, an amazing view but you need to get there early otherwise you could be waiting an hour or more to get on"
Road the cable car from Sentosa to Mt. Faber. Great views of Sentosa and of Singapore and the harbor. Will go back again.
"In a group of 4, we were lucky enough to have a car of our own. The views Mount Faber through to Sentosa were wonderful. The staff are very friendly. The car itself was nice and clean."
A fantastic scene greets you when you sail across the sky to Sentosa Island. Here you can see more attractions in this holiday island made famous by the Kim and Trump Singapore Summit that took place e just over The last a week ago.
Enjoyed the trip across from Mt Faber on the cable car had a great day at Sentosa Island late night back after watching the light and laser show ofv the beach. Well worth the trip we were advised to get off at Harbourfront station on the way back as there were more taxis available than going onto the next stop at Mt Faber. Great views
"The Cable Car offers great views but is also a good way to visit Sentosa Island. Our ticket allowed us to travel on the additional cable cars on the island. We didn't realise that you had to alight on the Skyscraper stop to get a taxi back to the city, but they were kind enough to let us back on at Mount Faber to go back! Tickets are available at Mount Faber if not organised beforehand and they offer combination tickets to other attractions."
"Excellent experience. Just double check where you are going. Fantastic at night. The lights at night were amazing , well worth seeing."
As cable cars go they are clean and view is great of the island and from a good height. There may be queues on buying tickets but it is to be expected. You also get a another ride when on island on a linked cable ride.
Always like to take the cable car to Sentosa. Brought friends took the cable car from Sentosa to Mount Faber and back to Sentosa. A must try if you were in Sentosa or Mount Faber.
"Singapore is a pretty flat place, so it was nice to get up and see the view of Sentosa and the cruise ships below. There's really not much at the top, from what I saw. We had a drink, enjoyed the vantage point, and then rode back down. I would not put it on a par with going up The Peak in Hong Kong. But I'm not sorry we went."
From the top of the Mount to Sentosa this is the way to go I think there's 5 stations which you can on and off depending on the attractions you wish to see the last section you'll see the beaches We found the best seat was facing the Island Great views of the whole island a gotta do
Stunning view from the cable car. Take Cable car to Santosa Island from the City instead of going through MRT/Road.
"Best way to get into Sentosa island. If you require a taxi back, get off on the middle stop and catch one from the mall as there will be no taxi on the mountain, unless you specially call for one."
"The Singapore Cable Cars provide some great views but the cars are not air conditioned. Ticketing can be very slow even if you prepurchased online. Once you have your tickets, access to the cable cars at the various stations is quite easy. Don't bother with the add-on meal tickets as they can only be used at specific station, at specific time, and table may not be available, and food is not great."
"Loved it. My daughter, 7, was a little nervous but loved it in the end. We joined it at Harbourfront to go to Sentosa. Sign posts not obvious from Vivocity but we found it in the end. The deal at their office for Universal, Aquarium and unlimited Cable car was the best I had seen too - unfortunately I had already got the Hipopass but would know next time. The best bit was when you took off. Also try for sunset."
"We did the sentosa island cable car ,must say was thoroughly impressedThe view is exhilarating from the top ,aerial view of the entire sentosa islandLooking down is thrilling ,quite a distance up in the skyWas included in the any 3 ride passWould recommend take the longer cable car ride from sentosa station to the island ,it's a pretty nice experience"
We took the cable car from Harbourfront to Sentosa. Great view going over the water. I don't think you'd see anything more by going up to Mount Faber. It was $33 each return or $35 each including the other cable car line on Sentosa. We were glad we paid the extra $2 each as that saved us a lot of walking in the heat up to Siloso fort and back again. Recommend as a different way to travel across to Sentosa.
"I love the service so much , however some of the foreign workers are very rudeYou get to see fantastic views , photos and much more"
This cable car give to great views of Singapore and sentosa island .i loved it from go to the view was awesome and good speed .
Took the cable car to and from Sentosa Island. Really enjoyed the experience as you get to see unbelievable sights of the island. The car were very clean and the operators were very efficient. We got a free pass on this attraction as part of the Singapore Stopover Explorer Pass and were very impressed with the attraction.
"We used the cable car as an easy way to get to Sentosa Island, and then continued on to visit the whole cable car network. The ability to get off one link and then visit another is a real plus. We found that the monitors ensured that we were not crowded, making the rides pleasant."
This is a very nice tour where we can see all the nice beaches and the city while traveling to different stops. Best to topup with this when you purchase Universal Studio tickets.
Good way to get to Sentosa Island. Enjoyed the view and the slow leisurely ride. Lots of fun for kids to see Sentosa from the air too.
"Great way to get over to Sentosa Island and enjoy 360 degree views of the locality.However if you don't handle heights too well, then I would not recommend this form of travel over to the island - the cable does rock and wobble a little bit.Good value and different form of transport in getting to the Sentosa."
Very nice and friendly staff I wish they had air conditioning it's a nice ride the view is incredible
used the cable car for our sentosa trip. quite fun...great views...starbucks at the destination point.
The cable cars were really enjoyable and gave you great views of Singapore and Sentosa. It was 35 degrees while we were there and having no air conditioning in the cars was a tad unbearable at times especially when coming close to each station and sitting in them going round before heading out again. Don't know how they would do the air conditioning which is a shame since it can get quite hot and stuffy in the cable cars.
"Reasonable price and able to get over to the island, plenty for the children on the island. Plus the cable car went up to Faber Park and that gave very good views of Singapore and Sentosa Island"
Good way to get to Sentosa Island. Enjoyed the view and the slow leisurely ride. Like all things in Singapore they are clean
If it's your first time on a cable car then you should try this. Bit boring for us although the views are spectacular. Alot to do as well at each stop.
"Chilled out awesome vibe, what we did differently was to reach Santosa using the cable cars and had pre booked the tickets to and fro for the same. While Santosa tickets will offer various options to chose from a list of rides ... One must watch the sound and light show highly recommended, one of the best I have seen in the whole world. Santosa is full of options, try starting early in the day to make most out of your ticket and come back using the cable cars. Must see the Wings of Fire, probably one of the best light and sound show in world and war a Preety setting to sit outdoors and enjoying the show."
We had one day for going home to spend in Singapore. We feel lazy so take the cable car. Little bit of waiting but really good. Recommend.
We decided to take the cable car to Sentosa Island and so glad we did. It gave us great views of the surrounding area and was very relaxing. A nice way to soak up the scenery.
See my 'Faber park' review.The cablecar allows you to reach Sentosa. You can not buy oneway ticket.The cable car last boarding is at 21:30 (re-check it).The station is at Faber park. You can order romantic meal and enjoy additional attraction.Online booking is definitly cheaper.
I enjoyed taking the cable-car over to Sentosa Island and return. Great views and crossing the harbour area was great as we went right over the top of a docked cruise ship. It's a little pricey but wasn't crowded or busy.
"I recently took the round trip cable car that runs within Sentosa island. I enjoyed the view from the cable car which included Universal studio, nice beaches and green tree top. There was not much crowd on the day I visited but I was told there will be waiting time on some special days. If you have never been on a cable car and not afraid of heights, you must try this."
I ride it from sentosa island.You can see everything from up.The cable car is ver clean and safe.You pass by the sea and you can see the boats snd sentosa island.You can reach it by Mrt the purple line till you reach last stop the harbour point.It was a very nice experience.
First u go to harbour front station with MRT then buy ticket 33 SGD for round trip .by buying this ticket u can go faber peak first and then go to sentosa u can use internall cable car in sentosa with this ticket
"We had taken single sided cabel car to reach Sentosa -butterfly park.View is amazing, we waited for about 5 minutes to get into cabel car.Sentosa has also got multiple MTC which run for free of cost at 2 terminals from universal to wings of time (stop). Find the right plan if you want to skip cabel car."
"In order to reach for Luge ride, Butterflr//Inset Kingdom directly and not via road where the car will take you till sentosa and then internal sentosa bus will take you places, then we should use CABLE CAR which are part of tourist attraction.A driver will take you the hill and thne max 4 to 4 person board cable car which will directly take you to Sentosa island with magnificent view of PORTS, Harbour , Internal road and the cool Internal CABLE CAR station, you need to drop at second station.A mesmerizing experience for every traveller and use each opportunity to make your trip memorable."
"The views are great from the cable car, but not an activity for those with a fear of heights. Not much to do on Sentosa unless you want to spend time on the rides."
"Super clean , super efficient and a nice way to see Singapore from up high. We went from the mainland to Centosa Island with the cable cars. Cool experience."
We brought a all day pass and went around a few times - If you are going to be in the area a few days or more - You can upgrade for a very nominal cost - But NOTE as a visitor you need your passport with you
"Well this was not the longest cable car in which I travelled because I found Genting Highland, Malaysia one is longest one compare to Singapore Cable Car. But both the cable car will give you a different experience. Malaysia one pass over the hills and Singapore one pass over the sea."
"The Cable car is one of the many Tourist Attractions in Singapore.Accessible from 5 or 6 different stations, the Cable Car gives a very different view of the Singapore Skyline and Island as a Whole.We took the Cable car from Faber Station. Its the top most station on the Singapore City side and connects to the Sentosa Island Station.From this hill, you get to see the Port side of Singapore and Sentosa.Amazing View of the Island, Waterpark, Roads and other buildings around.I would say it is an experience worth the Price.8 people can accommodate in one Car.Water and Washroom facility is available.Small Store selling Souvenir and food Items.Must Visit once at-least."
"A little pricy (around SD$23 pp if I remember correctly) but well worth the price. We joined at Vivo City and bought return tickets that got us to Sentosa, over to Mount Faber and back to Vivo City again. We had (quite some) difficulty finding the cable car building when we arrived at Vivo and also had some difficulty understanding what tickets to buy. Assuming you are going to visit Sentosa as well, I would recommend paying an extra couple of dollars for the Sentosa cable car as well because it takes you to many of the attractions in the middle and Fort Siloso end of the island. Definitely a highlight of our trip."
Only a short ride great views. for us made more intresting as we passed over the top of our cruise ship
"It runs from Mount Faber via vivo City to Sentosa Island. When using the ropeway there was no queue, the ticket is expensive."
"For experience and beautiful aerial views of city, it is worth taking a ride. A cheaper option is to take the round trip ride on Sentosa (S$13 vs S$33 for city trip)."
"I'm not great with heights now, but decided we should do the cable car trip. I purchased the round trip tickets ,at a discount, off the internet before we travelled. Think it was about 40% discount so a good deal. We travelled up to Mount Faber and took the cable car from there over to Sentosa. The day we travelled, there were hardly any people going - so no queues. Got the car to ourselves on all the journeys. The views across Singapore are great, gets up quite high at one point but I just focused on the views. We got off at Sentosa but rejoined later and travelled along Sentosa, then back across to Mount Faber. Recommend the trip, worth going for the views"
"Great fun quietly cruising above all.A different perspective and not a rip off to ride.There are two circuits of cars, check your tickets as you can get off one and onto the other!"
"I made somewhat of an adventure out of this; biking to the park, walking up the stairs then heading over. It's a little pricey for a cable car and a little but of a time commitment but the views are great. The sentosa line is short but it's still nice to see the beaches and ships. Overall I think if you have more than 3-4 days in Singapore you should add this to your list."
"I didn't like very much the view because the part of our route passed by the industrial zone. The cabins do not go very smoothly, so the trip was quite scary. We took ticket on unlimmited rides on every station (Merlion Station, Sentosa Station, Imbian and Siloso).But this cabel cars deliver you to the Sentosa island with a lot of entertainments. We tried Adventure Cove Waterpark , Skyline Luge, Sentosa Merlion.We tried Skyline Luge for 3 times. This is karting, so I recommend wearing shorts.Adventure Cove Waterpark is a place where you float on inflatable ringand then you get into the fish tunnel.Sentosa Merlion is a Symbol of Singapore. You can get on both Merlion's head and mouth, but my favorite part is the pool behind Merlion. I highly recommend this pool. It is designed in the style of the Spanish architect Gaudi."
We had a great experience on our way to Sentosa Island. The cable cars were clean and plenty of seating. We rode most of the say without others in our car.
The Singapore cable car provides connectivity to the amusement center of Sentosa Island. The view from the cable car is unique.
Taking the cablecar to visit Sentosa is probably the best way to go to the island but unlike all other cablecars in the world this one runs very slowly. And going to Mount Faber isn't quite as interessting as going to Sentosa.
"We avail the 3 rides, sentosa, mount faber and siloso. I really enjoyed the view.. Its a great way to end up in sentosa place. They also gave us ref magnet of cable car for souvenir."
"It's a new place and I had a fabulous experience - all Singapore tourists must try this and not miss it .. my advice is to take the cable car from the mountain to Santosa and from there you can reach all the attractions like Universal studios, sea life aquarium, museum ..... etc"
"The only thing about this Cable Car that is wrong are the people running it! The day we went was a long weekend for Chinese New Year. The cable cars take 8 people and the lifties were letting cars go with 4 people or less and the line ups were HUGE. Apart from the frustration of the operation of the lift, the view and the entrance to Sentosa were great."
Taking a trip on the cable car was an attempt to see Singapore from different angles and maybe get some photographs of the islands and beyond.
"We normally drive to Sentosa, but decided to take the cable car to view the island from high. Fast service when purchase the ticket."
For those who have fear of heights i think they can also ride this attraction.This a great attraction as you can see and enjoy the whole city from up above. This attraction will bring you to mt faber to sentosa island.
Wonderful view . Worth at least a one way ride . Perfect way to get over to the island. Try to buy tickets ahead of time because line is long.
"We caught the MRT to Harbourfront and booked tickets on the cable car to Sentosa. What we didn't realise was that you get a ride up to Mount Faber Peak as well, and for a bit extra can include the Sentosa cable car. I have to admit I don't like heights but it is something I have to do! I didn't like going up to Mount Faber Peak up over the road and valley but got used to it. We had a drink in the cafe at the top (make sure you get your change!! A lot of Americans visit this cafe early on as the cable car is close to the cruise terminal, and I think that maybe it is thought we don't count our change)We then rode all the way down to Sentosa, which was fun going over the top of the cruise ships! At Sentosa we caught the Sentosa Island cable car both to Merlion and Siloso Point beach. A fascinating island - one end a bit like Disney, and the other end a quiet beach (though it does have a zip wire going over it at one point)"
It's was an exhilarating experience. A thrill to be up there while enjoying the amazing view. You can get off at every station and wonder around. Highly recommended.
My husband and I used the cable car to get to and from Sentosa. It's quite costly but a nice experience and a unique way to get to and from the island. The views are good - especially of the ports and the staff are good at not filling the carts up with too many people during quieter times so you can often get a cart to yourself.
"Took Taxi to the Cable Car , great view, second best in Singapore( after the flyer ) ! Very good views !"
"Cable car is reasonable and one way of ing to Sentosa island. Sentosa has so much to see and do. There are a few hotels to stay at also there is the fast train to ride like a monorail. Plenty of places to eat at plus there is a big food hall with variety to choose from as well plus McDonalds if need be.. Beach area to swim or a couple of bars on the ter edge as well. . There are souvineer places around, ice cream parlours, coconut drink stand, billabong m bikini bar to visit for a meal/snack, drink and play pool. Staff friendly. So much to see and do there it'# a must."
Nothing very spectacular but yes a ride through the greenery and down the mountain . It is the ride to sentosa island.The time also is very less so one cannot enjoy the sights.
Amazing experience.but the time is very less.should have been to n fro .upper view is also wonderful.Can be visited for a change
"One if the best way to go to Sentosa. You can take the cable cart, and fly across the sea toward Sentosa resorts.Along the bay, thee are cruiser and boats which makes the view tremendously great. Strongly suggest to by one day unlimited ride of cable cart."
"I bought a return ticket to and from the station by the harbour which lets you go up and down Mt Faber and to Sentosa and back. Your ticket is marked on each leg, so once you have done each section your tiucket has been used and if you want another ride you need to pay more-beware.The journey is good, with great views of the harbour and the mountain in all directions."
"This is a great way to view the busy harbour and also a nice way to visit Santosa Island, you will get some great pictures from within the cable cars. Only downside is that it's expensive for what it is ""a short journey"", however still worth a visit"
"We never had this trip before. But for our first time, this cable car trip was amazing. We had a great time enjoying the great view both from the car and from Mt. Faber. What a hideaway."
"The day we had planned this trip was rainy but that suited us just fine- not too hot, no burning sun and not loads of tourists. Had a bit of trouble navigating at first, enjoyed an amazing breakfast then the segway tour- tops!"
A bit confusing at first and not cheap like everything in Singapore but well organized. Staff are helpful to confused tourists. We first went to see the Merlion and then took a further car down to Sentosa and the beach but it was so very hot with little shade we just got back on the cars and went up to Mount Faber but to be honest not much to see.
It was our second day at sentosa islands and during sunset we decided to take a ride from merlin station to Faber peak.We are rewarded with beautiful viewing.The trolley was at the highest point during the ride. The single cabin could accommodate six to eight people.The ride was comfortable although my better half was afraid of the heights.
"We took the cable car one way to Sentosa Island and it was a lot of fun and gave us great views on the Island, the seaport and the city. It cost SGD29.00 per person one way."
Cable car ride is thrilling and adventurous. This takes you to so many wonderful sights to visit in singapore.
"We had stops at Sentosa and Mount Faber, enjoyed nice views. Prices could be reviewed for 'seniors'....including non residents...."
"There are 2 short cable car lines - 1 in Sentosa island, and the other liking Sentosa Island to Mt Faber.We visited on a weekday afternoon when it was very quiet, and were able to ride multiple times with an unlimited ride ticket. The cars are clean and well maintained and the attendants friendly. It's a good way to view Singapore and Sentosa Island from the air.Tip: Google Onefabergroup and buy your Sentosa tickets online for a 15% discount. If you would like multiple rides on the cable cars, but the Fly & Explore Pass which give you entry into the SEA Aquarium in Sentosa and unlimited rides on both cable car lines."
This is the most expensive way to get to Sentosa but certainly the most scenic and fun. It was a great way to start our day.We enjoyed it.
I took the cable car in Singapore after a long time and it didn't disappoint me. If you are local I'll recommend to sign for annual pass because you'll get 50% discount for the visitors you bring. Go to mount faber in the evening and enjoy the time there.
"We had time to spare, so went on Cable CarEnjoyed itVery highVery beautiful views of Singapore and Sentosa IslandBut there are so many things to do in Singapore. If your days are filled with other things, dont really have to go here especially if you have been on other cable cars or places with viewsBut we were tired of walking, had 2-3 hours to spare, did not go to the night safari and therefore had budget availble to go on the cable carNo regrets, will cherish it"
"When you visit Sentosa island in Singapore, opt Cable car option. This is around 15 minute drive to the island. Very good experience. you will be able to see an aerial view of the Sentosa, sea, Universal studio. This is a must visit when you are in Singapore"
"There are 2 lines, the Mount Faber Line & the Sentosa Line, they intercept at the middle station. We got a combined ticket for both at $33 each, starting at the Harbourfront Station, 15 storeys up. It's only a short walk from the Harbour Front MRT stop to the building. There is room for up to 8 people in the cable car, yet it wasn't too busy when we were there & we usually shared with another couple or a single traveller. Views are great & it's nice to peacefully go far above the hustle & bustle below. On Sentosa, be prepared to be fleeced. At the Merlion souvenir & refreshments shop a 330cl can of beer will set you back $16.00, a simple iced tea $3.50, might be worth it though, there is air-conditioning!"
"For the first time in my life, i enjoyed cable car and it was so exciting. I was looking at the ground again and again while traveling by cable car."
the ride is must for going into the sentosa island..its comfortable and invariably part of the day package which you take for the park
"The Cable car has 2 routes or lines - The Sentosa Line and the Mount Faber Line. The Sentosa line only takes you within the island of Sentosa, while the Mt. Faber line connects the mainland to Sentosa. We had a combined pass of both the lines. We took a cab to the Mt. Faber station, which overlooks the whole city and provides a nice view. A 15 minute ride, going over the hills, the marina and the sea, catching glimpses of the cityscape brought us to Sentosa.The Mt. Faber line starts from a hill called Mt . Faber on the mainland and takes you over the city and into the island of Sentosa. You get great views of the city and the skyline. Being a family of 4, we had the whole car to ourselves and my kids really enjoyed the view from the top and the 15 min journey. The cars have openings to let the air in and also glass windows. Interestingly when we were coming back, it started to rain and made the whole trip quite interesting with droplets of water coming. The trip also takes you over the harbour, where you can see ships docked in Singapore. If you are lucky, you might even glimpse a nice cruise liner right under your feet as you pass by !!!We used the Sentosa line just for fun, seeing the Merlion from up in the air, seeing the shoreline and the beach etc. However one may choose to avoid it totally."
"The expense is for to and fro ride. One way is about 15 to 20 minutes. It is a must for those who have never traveled in a cable car. The company representative take nice photos while boarding the cable car, which can be later purchased."
A bit 'been there done that' but you've got to do it! Great views and just go with the flow! Great look back to the city and over the port. If there's a cruise liner you get to go right over the top which is fun in so far as you're pleased to be on land rather than the cruise boat!
A ride from Mount Faber over the Keppel Harbour to Sentosa. great way to start your day and enjoy the views while en route to your activities in Sentosa or the other way around.
The cable car takes you to Sentosa Island and it gives one a great view of the area.Suggest it is caught at Henderson Waves to maximise the ride.
We took the cable car to get to and back from Sentosa Island. Great views during the day crossing over. Very clean and if going as a couple normally you get your own car or as a group up to 8 people. We took the car back in the evening and the sky line was totally different and worth it.
"The original cable car is always a fun way to get across to Sentosa island. Came here again recently with the intention of renewing the annual family membership. Unfortunately the membership office only opens around 11am - not sure why they're so late - so they weren't opened when we arrived at 9.30... So we decided to head over to Sentosa and renew at the other cable car office a bit later on. The annual membership for the family is pretty good value, although you do get a bit sick of the cable car after a while."
We booked a return ticket through Cable car to Sentosa. The cab drops you at the departing point and the return trip is smooth as well. We bought a package from a company but still need to be in a queue.
Even if you are a little concerned about heights - this is definitely worth it. At first I was a bit anxious but you soon get used to it. It is very efficiently run - and provides quick and easy access to Sentosa. I was expecting it to be a longer ride but it was still worth it and I was surprised that it was not air conditioned. Windows provide ventilation but it got quite hot.
Not a long one like the cable car in langkawi. Still we can enjoy nice view and experience it if not done it before anywhere..
"Great fun (and thankfully our return journey was just before an epic storm), but very expensive at about Â£19pp return for a journey that is less than 10 mins each way. Very high off the sea/ground in parts so not for the faint-hearted. Got a free fridge magnet at the end so some sort of keepsake for the Â£19!"
$29 Price is a bit exspensive but is for return trip if you want. We were told that a taxi would be difficult to get at the top of Mt Faber for return trip. Worth doing to go to Sentosa.
The view from the cable car is quite beautiful. Its a good way to see the entire sentosa island from the top.
"A great way to start and get Sentosa island. The view is very nice and it create enthusiasm prior reaching the pleasure island. However, the price for family is quite high"
"The kids marveled at this attraction. It was their first time on a cable car. The were very excited and a little scared, at least at first anyway. A great way for the kids to go to Sentosa island. A must say it is expensive though."
"Took the cable car from Mount Faber Park to Sentosa Island. The lines are long for the ride due to round trip riders. But once you get on, the scenic views are spectacular. Another attraction in Singapore providing great experience to see Its cleanliness and beauty."
"We went to Sentosa for the day. On the way there, we took the MRT and walked across the bridge. At night, we decided to try the cable car. We left from the island and took it across the water to the station near the mall. We then walked through the mall to the MRT. It was a nice ride and had very good views of the surrounding area."
Arrived on mrt at harbourfront. Cable car was not well sign posted but eventually found our way to cable car station in separate building to vivo shopping centre. Redeemed our sia card for tickets which was easy. Views from harbourfront to sentosa was very good.
"A bit pricey, but worth the journey to see the harbour. The staff are quite pleasant and the cars themselves are very comfortable. It wasn't busy so we had the car pretty much to ourselves."
"My fiancee and I spent the weekend in Singapore in October. She wanted to see a new country, and I wanted to take her to a romantic location to propose. :) When she first saw the Singapore Cable Car (Sentosa line) running near the Hard Rock Hotel on Sentosa Island, her eyes flew open wide and she said, ""WE HAVE TO RIDE THAT!!!"" I was happy to oblige and eager to ride it myself.The Singapore Cable Car has 2 lines, the Sentosa line that takes you along Sentosa Island and connects you to the second line, the Mount Faber line, which takes you off the island and to the top of Mount Faber. There are several stations per line that allow you to disembark or to connect to the other line. We used our round-trip ticket to get us off Sentosa (where we caught a taxi and went downtown), and later to return us to Sentosa at sunset.The view is spectacular...ESPECIALLY at sunset!!!Prices weren't cheap, but they weren't that expensive either. Depending on the time of day that you ride, you may get lucky and get your own car, but be prepared to share it with other groups...a ticket on the Singapore Cable Car doesn't guarantee you your own car. Each car holds 8-10 people, depending on how full they want to fill it. Cars move at a brisk pace and can sway a little if you move around or the winds are blowing. Those who have a fear of heights may want to pass on this experience.We took many memorable pictures and had a wonderful time cuddling in our car at sunset as we returned to the Sentosa line from Mount Faber, and later as we rode the entire Sentosa line after dark to take us back to the beginning of the Sentosa line near the Sentosa Merlion. We do not regret riding and would gladly go again if we ever find ourselves in Singapore once more. Our only gripe is that we wish it would have been longer. I realize that building something of that scale is absurdly expensive, but we wished there had been a 3rd line to take us deeper into the city.Ride away and enjoy the views!"
What a great way to get over to Sentosa Island. You have great views of the harbour. Awesome way to get some great holiday photos. I would definitely recommend to family and friends.
If you are in Singapore then it is an must experience place to visit. One time experience should be taken.
There are two cable cars: one from Singapore to Sentosa and other within Sentosa.Both give a good view of Singapore and Sentosa respectively.
"Cable car ride from Harbor front -> Mount Faber -> Harbor front -> Sentosa isle then followed by Imbiah station -> Merlion station -> Imbiah station -> Beach station -> Imbiah station.REMEMBER: if you like me and plan to visit and go around Sentosa or even universal studio for more than 3 times a year, then better get the FABER LICENSE pass -> allows you for unlimited use of the cable car AND the sentosa express train for 1 year (i got the family deal which allows me to give 4 people the license). It was 139 SGD for the whole family (110 SGD if renewal from Islander card)I like to bring friends or family or relatives to cable car trip in Sentosa so, this card is no brainer. I can get discount when buying ticket for them too (50% sky pass ticket)Within the 3rd visit to the isle using cable cars you have earned back your investment already compared to others who use single day pass or 1 trip pass etc.Like best: ease of use for traveling in Sentosa, beautiful view. Safe for children and not scary since it is encapsuled.Bring camera, selfie stick.Sit in balanced manner (e.g., not all passengers in one side)Come when it is not busy day/time so you can have the whole carriage for yourself. (in peak time you have to share with other ppl although you can try to request)."
"The view is great but I somehow prefer the Singapore Flyer where you can view Batam on clear nights. They now have a promotion for unlimited rides and once is enough for me, although my relatives from overseas went twice. That left me to take a look around the place and found out that the prices of eateries and souvenirs there were on the high side, save for the kiosk for soft drinks and ice cream across the road. Drove my relatives to Smith Street in Chinatown for dinner."
"I have tried different cable cars from other country as well. I took this a part of the itinerary due to family members first time experience. The ride still brings fun and thrill to me so i suggest make this part of your tour as well.we take the sky pass back-and -forth ticket which is just enough i guess to visit anywhere in Sentosa and in Faber mountain. This is about 5-10 dollar cheaper than unlimited ride. Honestly, we did not take cable car from Merlion Station back to Imbiah look out since it is just literally few steps away :). So the Skypass round trip tickets is just right to fit our need."
"nice experience, but nothing exceptional. You have many such cable car rides in India too. Very costly too."
"We done all lines and stations, hopping on and off and making the most of a lovely DRY day. We booked this on line and got a discount and saved time rather than queuing for our tickets. The attendants were all quite pleasant and as there was a cruise ship in port it was lovely gliding over the top of this. We certainly got our monies worth. In between stations we hopped on the transit (FREE) down to Sentosa, so we could get the cable car back.The best bit was , as it was not overly busy we had the cable car to ourselves, so you can stand where you like to get photos.Its surprising what you can see from the air, a lot more than you could possibly see from the ground. We glided over the water park and it looked absolutely great, I would have loved to go back with my grandchildren."
This gives an aerial and panoramic view of Santosa Island.. cable cars are very neat and newly made. Staff was good too..it makes us see forest to harbor to island. Very small kids would not love it very much but adults would really like it..
"Hop on this to get an excellent view of Singapore, especially the Sentosa Islands. There are a few stations in between. If possible take the cable car from the first station to the last station. It is just worth it. It is a very different and mesmerizing way to see Singapore in the evening specially."
Singapore Cable Car from Faber Peak is a different way to see Singapore do go in the evening to enjoy the sunset
"The cable car was a great way to see Mount Faber and Sentosa. Be warned that the day pass only covers one boarding per station, even if you do loop and do not exit at a station, they still mark you as boarding."
"this was our transport to the sea aquarium at sentosa island, you get an extended trip and wonderful views of the singapore night sky and sentosa island"
We used this to go to the island and enjoyed the ride! The facility feels safe and the views are exceptional of the city.
"We purchased the full ticket and went first to Mount Faber and then on to Sentosa. From there we used the other cable car to explore Sentosa Island, it's a great way to get a birds eye view of the island and surrounding Singapore."
"Coming from Switzerland, where every infant has used a Cable Car, the ride itself was nothing spectacular. I understand that it might be something special in a city which does not feature any real mountains. However the cable car itself was not something spectacular to me.What however was sensational, were the views that can be experienced on the way to Santosa Island. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing such a fantastic city from a completely new perspective. The ability to see over the bay and the island once arriving there was for sure a highlight.I would for sure recommend this way of transporting to anyone wanting to visit Santosa Island. The views are definitely worth it."
"Before I got to SG I knew I wanted to do the cable car ride but I didn't know where it went from/to. Although I'd made no plans to go to Sentosa Island, when I found out that's where the cable car stops, I thought I may as well explore the island a bit.The cable car is definitely worth doing. It's a nice little trip and you get to see some good sights. It's obviously a bonus if you're on there around sunset time.There's a number of different ticket options which you can combine with attractions at Sentosa to make the package price a bit cheaper. There's also a cable car on Sentosa Island, so you can even buy a ticket where you can have unlimited rides on both cable cars. I opted for just the Mount Faber cable car return ticket which was $29 / Â£16.Be sure to walk around Mount Faber before or after you get the cable car. It's a nice little walk with good photo opportunities. There's the highest point, some colourful steps and the bell of happiness."
"I think one line is temporarily closed, so the ride is only 20 min right now. A nice, quiet scenic ride."
Great way to get from Singapore to the resort island. See from a different prospective. Enjoyable for all ages.
"We rode this attraction last week. What a fantastic experience with views of Sentosa Island activities and the city skyline.The entire ride consists of two lines; the Mount Faber Line from the mainland ($29 include Sentosa entry) and the Sentosa Line ($13) or for both lines ($33). Rather than purchase a specific ticket for this ride we purchased the 'Singapore Pass' that allowed us one 'free' complete circuit each. We rode all sections from the Island back to the main land.Every cable car offers different views of Singapore and it's many attractions. The ride provides a great view of the zip line, beach areas, Adventure Cove Water Park and Universal Studio. The cable car ride is smooth and quite long.For two segments of our ride the three of us had the car to ourselves (they seat 8) but for the final segment when there was a long line on the mainland to return to the island we had to share."
We took the canle car back from sentosa island to the Singapore city. The ease of access is great the journey and the views were magnificent. It was dissappointing that you had to purchase a returnticket when we only wanted totravelthe one way having said this it was still a great experienmce which is well worth doing.
"You can view city from Cable car, its nice experience if you have never take such cable car earlier.While travelling to Santosa , you can take this cable car and see top view of santosa and city around. Good Experience."
The views are great but if you have a fear of heights do not go on it. The ride was smooth and enjoyable and a great place to take photos.
The cable car ride was one of the highlights of Singapore. It gives you a Panasonic view f the city and takes you to Santosa for a fun filled adventure. Good to go early morning so you have enough time for all the attractions
This is well worth doing if you are venturing to Sentosa Island...our daughter thought it was amazing.
"As with everything in SP the cable car was easy to find from Harbour Front MPT, efficient, safe, clean and good value for money. We tagged on a few attractions on Sentosa to our ticket but the day pass by itself allowing you unlimited rides on both lines of the cable car is good value."
"Took the cable car ride to Sentosa but if you have the iVenture card then you cannot take it from Mount Faber, so instead we rode it back from Sentosa to Mt. Faber and it was great. Overall not a very long journey but very nice views. However there are limited transportation options from Mt. Faber and it is a bit tricky to get a cab so public transport might be the only option."
cable car to sentosa is superb and nice. beautiful view and a different exprience. sentosa view from cable car is breathtaking.
We used the cable car on our Sentosa island visit. Really nice ride. They will try and allow an exclusive gondola for a family which we really appreciate. Nice and easy ride with great views. Helpful staff.
The views were outstanding you could see everything and anything for miles!!Don't go on if you don't like heights though it gets very high and was a little scary at times
"Really enjoyed the cable car. Great way to discover Sentosa IslandOnce you get through the ticketing line, its all good"
The experience of traveling in the cable car was exciting but it was mission to find the place to get the tickets as the signs were misleading. Had to ask around a couple of security guards who worked at the office buildings before finally getting there.
"it was fun to ride, easy mode of travel going to Sentosa. A moment to combat my wife's fear on heights and she did it!"
I was rather scared at the beginning but once in it turned out to be a beautiful experience to see almost whole of Singapore
It gave a great view of the harbor enroute. Also you got a view of the large Singapore lion fromn the air.
"Took this ride while we were visiting Santosa Island. we rode both of the cable car routes excellent views, worth the trip"
"Aerial view of sentosa gives you an idea of how meticulously planned the whole Island is, there is not an inch of space un-utilized or under-utilised. The water treatment plant and water theme park and what not, you can see it all in this ride.."
"The cable car journey provides some amazing views of Sentosa. Stops include the Merlion, Siloso Point and Mount Faber.You can buy tickets at the Harbourfront station as well as buy tickets in conjunction with a number of attractions to tailor to your needs. The tickets for the Mount Faber Line + Sentosa cost S$33 for an adult and S$22. Tickets for an unlimited pass on the cable, S.E.A Aquarium and Universal Studios cost S$122 for an adult and S$90 for a child.With these tickets you can hop on and off without the hassle of buying new tickets. Once you leave the station many of the attractions such as the MegaZip, Skyline Luge and Madam Tussauds are nearby. It is worth doing once just to admire the view."
"The cable car ride from Mt Faber to Sentosa Island was one part of an afternoon/evening tour....though there are a number of sightseeing passes available that include the cable car and you could certainly manage to visit this place on your own rather than do it as a tour.The cable cars are surprisingly large, very steady and have huge windows to allow for great photo opportunities and unimpeded views of the island and it's surrounds. The trip takes 15-20 minutes or so and stops once midway for the mandatory souvenir photo to be taken by the on-site photographer....printed up at lightning speed and available at the end of the ride! Definitely a must do in Singapore!"
"The Cable Car is very smooth no bumps, its also very clean glass is spotless. Well worth the trip lovely views."
"It is highly recommended that you take Cable car while going to Sentosa as you get a beautiful view of the island and the bay. It also gives you good view of the city. There are multiple platforms from where you can board, Faber mountain being one of them which is very close to city center. It is advisable to prebook this ride in advance and online."
"My partner and I celebrated my birthday over sky dining and the experience is pretty mixed but amazing.Why mixed feeling? I have been to many cable car trip in most cities, Singapore's cable car sky view is probably the least exciting.The dining loop is between Mount Faber and Sentosa. Anyway, you will get a free ride from Harbourfront to Mount Faber if you decided to park your car around Vivo City Shopping Mall (Why not?). The dining is around 1.5 hours, as you eat the sky get darker and more romantic along the way. The experience is very private and you can share your happiness with your partner loudly for once without bothering anyone.I recommend one of the partner to select the vegetarian option. The dishes are more unique.#thumbsup"
"We went on the cable car to go over to Sentosa island on our trip to beautiful Singapore in July 2017, now to be perfectly honest, I HATE cable cars, I'm terrified of heights, but as far as terrifying experiences go, this one was not so bad, it's very high, very smooth, great views, and it's pretty cool that you actually go right through the middle of a building at the halfway point! I found it less scary that others I have been on, and as with everything in beUtiful Singapore, it's clean , the staff are very friendly and helpful and everything is well maintained. One tip, DONT go on a windy day, trust me!"
"If you would like to have the ride, please ensure your ticket issuance agent as some agents are located at Vivo city mall and the cable car office is in the next builidng with around 15 - 20 mins of walkingThere is another station which is near to the entrance but if you want to buy your things then vivo city entreance hall be the bestthe cable car is very nice, clean and well arranged and it is peacfull with nice view on Singapore"
"Going to Sentosa via Cable car from Mount faber was a good experience. Good areal views of Harbour, Sentosa and trees from the cable car. If you take a package ticket from Mount faber you get 2 or 4 rides at Sentosa very cheap."
"I had traveled in the cable car twenty years ago and was keen to revisit and see how the skyline had changed. It is a great opportunity to see a panoramic view, including the Universal Studios castle. I loved the beaches on Sentosa Island- I am sure they were there on my last visit. Staff were particularly helpful. Lots of shops, great coffee and my only regret was that we didn't have longer to explore all the stops on the cable car. Well worth it."
The cable car is a must do to get to Sentosa. It's so exciting and a wonderful way to see so much of the island and the city. At Mt Faber there are some cool things to see like the Happiness Bells and when you go over Sentosa you can see so much and get well orientated as to how to get to the places you want to visit there. Good fun and very high!
"The absolytely best way to travel to Sentosa island. We were expecting the cable cars to be packed, but apparently the morning was not too busy and each time we got the cable car for our family only. Friendly staff on every station, modern cable cars make you feel safe even if you're travelling high (!!) in the air. Buy the one-day ticket so you can enjoy the rides as many times as you wish!"
"If you're going out to Sentosa - you probably are - this is the way to go there. We took the cable car from Harbourfront to Sentosa on the way out there, and on the way home we went all the way up to Mount Faber. Nice views, but difficult to get a taxi, so go up to Mt Faber, and then back down to Harbourfront (same price)."
"Took the kids back here today for the trip from Mt Faber across to Sentosa. Easy to park the car at Mt Faber and then just take the cable car across, provided you can leverage the annual pass. The views over the ships in the harbour are good as are the views over the attractions around Sentosa. Although the cable cars on this route are older than the other line (across Sentosa only) they at least have fans in them which can really help on a hot day."
Good photography.Great view.Get there by taxi. Mount Faber Cable Car Station.No eating places at stations.
"It's wonderful to have dinner on cable car.However, I was dizzy after had the dinner, maybe lack of oxygen at cable car.The worst thing was that no one helped me at all even I sat on the floor.I think it was good experience to enjoy the dinner during sunset.You must enjoy it especially you like the view at cable car.The traffic was not convenient and we need to call taxi when we left the station.It is better to take the cable car if you stayed at Sentosa."
"If you want to see the marina area of Singapore from high up, and don't mind paying SGD29 per person for the privilege, then this is for you. First, however, make sure you find Farber Hill, where it originates."
If u take the cable from mount fabor which is highest peak in Singapore then u get most time on the cable car.Most of its length is over the sea..Although due to height it makes u nervous but it is actually a very smooth travel.It takes u inside sentosa and u can have a overlook of the whole park from here.Its cool and u should try but maybe not a must do activity.
"The cable car travels across the harbor and sometimes you get to see some big boats even cruisers. Comparing to the train, it's also not that crowded."
"Amazing views, air conditioned, safe, friendly service, quick, seated 8 people, comfortable seats and cars."
That is cool way go to Sentosa and Universal. Great view and with friendly customer service. A lot of people use cable car.
"The destination to Sentosa Island we can walk, use the MRT or also use this Cable Car. We have to go to Vivo city first to use Cable car and headed to Sentosa Island. We will see a good view from the heights up Cable car with the distance of approximately 15 minutes to arrive at Sentosa Island."
ok so if you want to get a great sky view of singapore without paying the high costs of the singapore flyer then this is a cheaper option.just dont get up and make sudden moves in the cart if there are a few of you as its rocks.Im scared of heights but overall it was a very good experience. Would i do it again no because of the fact im scared of heights.Am i glad i went in it and saw the views yes ofcourse. Lol
We took the one way from the shopping mall to Sentosa. My wife had never been on something like this so she wanted to try. She loved the photo opportunities. This attraction is a bit expensive and the line to get our tickets was short but still took too long. My guess is they spend too much time trying to up sell.
A second time for us but this ride has its own beauty to start your Sentosa trip. Excellent view of Singapore Bay.
Lovely and nice view and one should visit atleast one cable car to see the ariel view .specially in second half
Its a verh good cable car as the ground which it covers down and the scenic beauty of singapore which you get to see is simply unmatchable..........great experience
"A little difficult to find when you are in Sentosa Park. Grabbed the last cable car up to Mount Faber. My son is always afraid of heights, but he loved the view, as did I! All the twinkling lights popping on below us was fun to watch."
We have taken Sentosa line and the views were amazing. Full aerial view of sentosa can be seen from this line. We enjoyed a lot.
Hop on to Singapore's cable car to the Sentosa Island or the State of Fun. Immerse yourself in this wonderful ride which offers a spectacular birds-eye view of the island and the main city. Do get round trip tickets or opt for value tickets which offer admission to the exciting places of interests in the Sentosa Island.
The Cable Car offers some great views of Singapore. It is not the cheapest ticket around but it is worth it for those views.
"We took the MRT and arrived at the cable car, it was easy to get tickets, the view from the cars was great, we didn't do anything on the island just enjoyed the cable car trip.Big shopping centre near by so easy to find lunch etc.We worth visiting"
This was our style of ride. Great views of Sentosa. Recommended.Would buy an annual pass if you are likely to go back - not much more expemsive.
We took cable car to enter Sentosa Island. It was a package trip which covered both Mount Faber Line and Sentosa Line. Breathtaking views from the cable car. Not much crowded unlike other attractions in Sentosa.
"Normally, a cable car is more of an attraction in most of the places, especially for viewing scenery from heights. But the Singapore Cable car is actually a transportation option which transports us to different station similar to a train.The network is extensive with multiple lines and since everything in Singapore and Sentosa is connected through Escalators and lifts, it is easier to travel through these."
"this ride was over the land and sea, and comfortable 8 seater cable car ride. If at the right time, we get to see the cruise ships as well. Provides a very good view throughout."
"3 routes to choose from: mainland to Sentosa island, on Sentosa and also up Faber mountain. The whole system is well maintained and you will enjoy a safe ride!"
"If your kids have never been in a cable car, and your itinerary for the day is not too packed, this is a great family activity to do, to lead up to other activities that you are interested to cover on Sentosa Island. You get a good bird eyes view of the island and the ride is at a very relaxed pace. The staff on duty were generally helpful and facilities around from ticketing, F&B, gift shops were adequate. For this trip we bought the unlimited pass with Mount Faber as our start and end point. The management has come up with lots of ticketing options/package deals which allows you to pick several activities on the island to be added on to the cable car rides. Best to check out their website for more details so that you can plan and decide whether the deals are worth your while."
"Well worth the experience, you can purchase the second cable car located on the island at the same time. We boarded at the harbour front and visited the peak first before catching the cable car down to the island"
Relaxing and nice view over the Sentosa island. Didnt take to faber mountain as we didnt have time. Buy a ticket for more activities in Sentosa Island and get this as part of that.
Nice and easy way to go to Sentosa. Good views. I enjoyed a lot going there by cable car. I have chosen both: to go to the island and go along it. The bus there is free.
Best way to be in Sentosa Island!! Comfortable and very good service.Children will love the ride. Excellent views.
This is a Aerial link from Mount Faber to Sentosa. We get to see the harbors beneath during the aerial ride.Children will love this ride as this is calm.
This cable car ride from the Mount faber peak to the Sentosa covers two different landscapes with a ride above the rain forest and also above the sea to reach the Senotsa island. Children will love this cable car ride. It is quite different experience during day time and again when the night falls. Ride this cable car to experience it.
"It was a last minute unplanned trip on a Sunday afternoon, my family and I decided to visit Sentosa island via the Singapore Cable Car after having our lunch at VivoCity mall. We boarded the cable car from Harbour Front tower 2, just 5 mins walk from VivoCity mall.Tickets were fairly priced, $33 per adult for a return trip on the Faber and Sentosa line. Faber line is the link from Mount Faber up till Sentosa island, then we alighted and walked about 3 mins to Imbiah Lookout station to hop on the Sentosa line which we took to Siloso beach, got off for a bit of sightseeing then boarded again to Merlion station to view the famous giant Merlion statue. The price tag per ticket wasn't too bad if you have plans to visit the whole island and stop over at Mount Faber for some nice views.The cable car itself was quite solid and it didn't shake mid air. Though it can get super hot and humid due to the hot weather and there were no fans or air cond available in the cable car except cooling fresh air from outside which we could hardly feel. So be prepared to sweat, and definitely wear beach or short clothing.Overall, we enjoyed the ride and this is definitely a must go to ride at least once, if you visit Singapore or Sentosa island."
Liked the experience although the one in hongkong is simply amazing. But once at Sentosa it is great.
"We have taken the cable car many times. Our first trip was the longer one from Mt. Faber. Other trips were from harbourfront.You want to stay on it because it is so pleasant, especially on a blue sky and sunny day! Do not be afraid. The cables are quite thick, The access on and off are very easy. It is a great introduction to Sentosa Island and its venues. I recommend a round trip ticket. Families may wish one way and take the wooden walkway back to Harbourfront. Be sure to get a map when you land on Sentosa regardless of how you arrive. The map and trams are very helpful."
"So we bought return ticket for this cable car. We experienced beautiful scenery, both for Mount Faber line and Sentosa Line. Most writers will suggest to have fun and take photos in Mount Faber. Unfortunately, we couldnt do that because particular reason :( Hope we could go there someday :)"
Well you must take a ride on this wonderfull cable car as it provides awesome view of sentosa island and Universal studios from top and it is one of the top attraction of sentosa island as well.
"A great way to get to Sentosa, we took the cable car across to visit Singapore Universal Studios and it made a very interesting ride across. Not sure I would do it to simply turn around and come back again but if you're already making the trip, it's definitely worthwhile. Great views and felt very safe indeed, if it's quiet you'll get a car to yourself which is even better."
"We did for the view, rode out to Sentosa and back. Nice cars, I think they were air conditioned so comfortable. A few photo opportunities, but a bit expensive."
"The cable car gives an overview of Sentosa and the sprawling development explosion that has occurred there in recent times. The views are simply spectacular.Drawbacks include the cost of the ride, plus the hassle of standing in line to buy the tickets.Nevertheless, if you are not afraid of heights, this is one Singapore experience that should be had at least once."
"Although I enjoyed this ride. I wish it was easier to locate the place where you can begin the ride. We had a hard time searching around VIVO only to find out..it is a bit far from there. Nonetheless, it is a must do in Singapore"
Worth going once for the experience. There is nothing much to do at the Faber peak. So you can go till Faber peak and come back. You get a good view of the singapore port.
Interesting views of the Sentosa island leading up to Faber Peak - worth a trip. Lots of tourist shops.
"Amazing way to travel, especially for not experienced. Wonderful sights from above and landscapes. Strong emotions"
"The cable car attraction has been a tourist highlight for over 30 years and continues to be "" a must "" when visiting, The cable car / chairlift is the ideal way to travel to Sentoso and offers spectacular unequaled views"
Get on at Faber Peak to go to Sentosa Island and coming back get off at the Harbourfront stop. Then you can cruise through the enormous Harbourfront Shopping Mall
You can get spectacular views from inside cable. If you came from faber park you will get mount view and then sea view in the mid way. Can see amazing Singapore port from up there. The best time for view is sunset time. Staff there also friendly.
We were going to Sentosa and as we found discounted tickets (approx. 25 USD) we decided to buy. If you come to Singapore it is a must experience attraction as it is a nice ride and the view is beautiful. But the total ride is short (especially the one on Sentosa) and it is possible that you will be standing and waiting in long ques
"It is a great cable car ride with views over Singapore. We boarded at Harbourfront, went up to Mount Faber and then down to Sentosa. It is a high cable car so not too good if you do not like heights."
This is a nice way to get a good view of the city as well as reach Universal or Sentosa if you do not want to go by road all the way. Its a short ride but a good experience.
"While this might be an expensive option to consider for the view, the value of accessibility should be bulk of the price for families traveling with elderly. As the other options would be highly dependant on the crowd at the moment.The trip can be considered short compared to those overseas though should be tried once while you're here, can be either going or returning trip."
You can avail the cable car when you visit Sentosa. But it's a bit expensive & you might not feel the value for you money. coz it's hardly 2 mins ride in cable car from one station to other.
The family enjoyed the ride but with no family ticket on offer it was an expensive way to get to Sentosa. Next time I would use the bridge or get a taxi.
"This is a bit pricey, but you will see some wonderful views. People working here are friendly, and you can get a round-trip price."
"On recommendation from an Uber driver we took the cable car from Mt Faber. The cost was $29 return which we thought was a little expensive, but it was a good experience. The views were fantastic and it's a great way to get to Sentosa Island. There are lifts and elevators at all stops (you can hop off at Vivo City) so it is pretty accessible.I would have given a five rating, but what let it down for us was once we got back to Mt Faber there were no taxis. There was a little stand with a number on it but we didn't have phone access. There is apparently free wifi, but none of us could log on. The staff wouldn't call us a taxi but said we could go back to Vivo City (no extra charge) and get a cab from there. So we had to line up to get back on.It would be good if this was explained when tickets were purchased as we were tired by this time (after spending a few hours on Sentosa) and the last thing we wanted to do was line up again."
"Nice views, providing its not raining, you can see for miles on a clear day. My only whinge was that some cultures clearly don't do queuing so feel free to barge people out of your way!"
Cable car round trip from mount Faber to sentosa n back in the evening is priced at SGD33 per head....Take a city tourist map n avail a 10% discount....The tickets price include fare in sentosa cable car from merlion to Imbiah to siloso point n back....The staff at mount Faber do not explain this n if u do not study ur tkt properly you miss out on using this coupon....Like we did....We only requested for a cable car ride tkt to sentosa n back...But the staff offered only this option...Making it a Take it or leave it situation...
Travelling from Mount Faber to Sentosa Island via cable car is an unique way to see a great island attraction. The views are spectacular and well worth the experience
"If you are scared of heights don't worry, their safety record is exceptional ... I asked because I done like heights yet alone glass cabins. I would be lying if I said I wasn't scared but once the journey started you relaxed a little and enjoyed the views. I would do it again."
The Cable Cars are a fun way to see Singapore from another angle. Starting at Mount Faber you can descend to Senosa island then traverese it on another line. Best do this in the morning before all the other tourists arrive and you'll have a car to yourself (and a beach on the island).
"This was a great way to see Singapore and once we were on it it wasn't too busy so (despite only being two people) we always got a car to ourselves!Although we had booked tickets in advance, we ended up queuing to get a paper voucher - afterwards we realised we could have used a machine to pick up our ticket without queuing at all!! Keep your eyes peeled."
"If you plan to visit Sentosa Island, Cable car is one of your choice. You can get on The cable at Vivo City and get off at Sentosa Island."
There are two line for this. One which connects to few attractions in Sentosa n other which connects vivo city mall n Sentosa. For top view of Sentosa n sea its a best place to be.
Great views of the city and harbour. Great way to travel into Sentosa as you can see everything on the island. Reasonable priced.
"It was pretty much what you would expect it to be, Hop on and off if you have booked the round trip $33 per adult at the gate, Staff very friendly, booked using govoyagin print off tickets at hotel reception (saving 33 percent which cost 80$ instead of $120 at the gate for both cables cars round trip), one going onto the mainland and the other on Santosa, you can get off and on if paying for the round trip, or go on a one way trip.If you use govoyagin, ask your hotel reception if you can print out there most will oblige, now that I saved there will try on the night safari and gardens by the bay, every bit helps.Also if using govoyagin on the top of page change the money to Australian dollars and use your normal credit card as would not accept nab traveler card.We were happily surprised that at the end of the coloured cable cars route there was a lift up to a lookout called fort siloso which also had some history on the war, all free!! Fav four letter word.I would say if your going to only choose one do the one that stays on sentosa, and explore the Island.Happy travelling."
Buy a ticket once and ride on the cable car multiple times. We bought a ticket after we entered Sentosa and used the cable car to reach some of the attractions inside. And finally took the cable car out to exit Sentosa and got off at the Harbourfront Station. If you happen to get off at the Mount Faber station then be prepared for a climb down the hill. Harbourfront station is the most convenient place since it is very close to the MRT and bus and makes it very convenient
"The cable car is new, clean and big but sadly I was alone. I took the cable car from Sentosa and the view very nice."
"My son and I were able to get discounted tickets using the HANDY phone the hotel gave us to use. We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel on Sentosa. If you pay full price, then I do not think it is worth the price. We paid S$31 total for one adult and one child. We were able to get return tickets on both cable car lines. One takes you to Fort Siloso via Imbiah and the other line takes you across the water from Sentosa to Mount Faber, via VivoCity.Views were fantastic as you go quite high. It did get a bit hot inside the cable car but they do have mini fans, which did a little. It is worth a visit. There is not much at Mount Faber apart from the Bell of Happiness, which isn't that exciting."
It gives a picturesque view of the Sentosa island. You can take the tickets or buy online . Some relatable websites may even offer you a discount on online purchase .
"We took the Singapore Cable Car to Sentosa Island from the Mount Faber station. The views are fantastic and the ride very smooth. The route takes you through the top of an office block and, when we were there, over the top of a cruise liner.We booked our tickets through the hotel and got them almost half price - full price is S$33 per adult which includes access to the Sentosa Cable Car when you're on the island. To get up to the Faber Mount Station we took a taxi which was by far the easiest unless you're on an organised tour.Coming back we jumped off at the Waterfront Station as theres a taxi rank at the bottom - we thought it would be difficult back at the Mount Faber Station as theres no rank.Definately high on the list of must do's if visiting Singapore."
"Best way to have a scenic sky view while going to Sentosa. It's best to book in advance. You can get a free bus ride to any location in Sentosa. The Sentosa Cable car station also has some nice cafes, starbucks, subway etc & small adventure rides."
"If you haven't done it before...then you must try. Nice way to get to Samoza island.However when you get to the island, it was not easy finding the way to universal studios, you will need to ask which bus"
"We had seen the main Singapore attractions before embarking on a cruise. Back for a stopover, we took the cable car up to Mount Faber for the highest views, then back right over our ship to Sentosa Island. There were pleasing and sometimes surprising views all along the routes. We got off at stops on the island for closer looks at the beach, the big Merlion, the casino and the general mall amusement area. Very enjoyable on a beautiful day."
We went on the cable car on the last day of our cruise and did our own thing and did not take it as an excursion. We had great views of Singapore and Sentosa Island and also had a good nature walk. We did not go on any of the the attractions on Sentosa but found that just walking round there was enough. A must do trip to do.
"We took this from the park to Sentosa and back, and really, really enjoyed it. It's a long ride, and it can be a bit scary (especially if it gets stuck like it did for us, if only for a little while). I recommend parking at the park and riding in to Sentosa and then back."
We got discounted tickets for the cable cars so we decided to go... that and also because we knew the views would be amazing! Taking the cables were easy ... each stop had something to do although we personally didn't stop at every one!
"Being scared of heights, I wasn't able to enjoy the view much but my wife enjoyed it and loved the ride and the view. Better options available such as the Banff National Park Gondola Ride and one in India too, but every city looks different from a higher altitude, which makes such rides worth going once.The Singapore Cable Car rides have Two-way tickets which one can utilize for going to Sentosa early in the morning and return late night to see the view in Day-time as well as night-time."
"Gives some nices views of the city. It's worth it if you are in that sort of thing, otherwise it will not change your mind."
"When we arrived to use the cable cars, the first part of the trip that takes you down to the beach and shore was not in operation due to updates and repairs. However, they had coaches that took you down to the beach area and from there you could go on the cable cars and enjoy the view from there. Easy to use and easy to embark and disembark from the cable cars. The staff are very helpful and the cable cars and cable car stations are very bright and clean."
It is recommended that one takes this cable car ride at least one way for it offers a fantastic view of the Sentosa Island and the Singapore Bay.
We used the Cable car to go from Sentosa to Faber Mt to walk the Southern Ridges and then return. Great views and relatively cheap ($30.00) return per person. Cable cars are clean and easy to look out of. Good facilities at Faber Mountain.
"The cable experience is awesome. It starts from Harbor Front 15th floor. You shall be surprised to note that the cable car is boarded from the 15th floor (exact floor may be different) of a building. One takes an escalator to board the cable car.The capsule of the cable car can easily house 4-6 people; but the operators give all privacy to visitors by housing them to independent capsule on basis of their own company. Maybe that during huge visitor traffic they alter their practice.The cable moves above the sea line that differentiates the Singapore from Sentosa island. The cable starts rising high while crossing the water beneath. You shall sight yachts, steamers in the waters below. One shall sight the approaching Sentosa island and the Singapore left behind. The Sentosa island is housed with several attractions and resorts. From that height one is able to see the top surface of most of the attractions. The journey is small but interesting.Now, I must make the most important fact. While returning back by the same cable car do not disembark at the Harbor front point wherefrom you had embarked the cable. Keep sitting and inform the staff their that we want to see Mount Faber point. No extra amount is charged for this additional trip. They shall allow you to continue beyond and within minutes your journey explores an extension towards Mount Faber. It is a high spot encircled with many trees. It has a small shop and an open restaurant. You can spend some time over there and then return back by embarking the cable once again.The journey shall conclude at the same place where you had started from. Good experience indeed."
"A good experience, some great views from the Mount Faber line and the Sentosa line. A neat experience."
"This is a nice way to see some of the views of Singapore while on the way to Sentosa Island. We ended up doing this trip both ways, then went back another day and took the monorail one way and cable car again the other. Purchasing the return trip is best value."
"Ride a cable car goes to sentosa island, that is must to do if you want to see good view from sky.One cable car is enough for 4 person, but we are lucky because only both of us when we ride there.Little bit expensive, but very worthed with view we get from sky."
wenton round trip as no time to stop at sentosa but better value to go to sentosa went over it in cable car lots to see in park for families
"This is a must do while in Singapore, and to get over to the Island of Sentosa. If you buy a complete round trip then you can ride the other 2 cable cars on the island."
"It is a fantastic view, we take this ride after 6pm when the ticket price whas cheaper and we have a fantastic view over the sunset, and a round the islands."
Got to see a lot of the waterfront. It goes from the mainland to Sentosa Island. Took a lot of pictures.
Simple cable car to take you from the Mount Faber Park to Sentosa Island. Nice view. Use it only once and then come back with free tram from Sentosa to the city.
"Easy to enter and easy to exit.As a person who has fear of height,I thought i would'nt enjoy but oh boy i was surprized!Must vsit"
"This is another must whilst visiting Singapore, the views are incredible, we travelled from the station on Faber mountain to Sentosa then back to Harbour side. Again great friendly staff. Would recommend this experience.Peter B."
Just another cable car but the views are great. You can see back to the city as well as seeing Santosa in full view.
"A lovely island that is worth a look. We took the cable car over, and did the length of the island on the one that operates there. Also took the bus island tour and saw how the other half live. Great beaches, excellent views and even cool beach bars. Give it a go, you won't regret it."
"The cable cars offer an easy access to Mount Faber/Faber point, as well a a mode of transportation to Sentosa Island.Unfortunately the secondary line that goes across Sentosa island in east-western direction was being services when I visited. So I only tried the Mount Faber - Harbourfront - Siloso Point (and back) routes.I visited on a weekday outside holiday, and had no problems getting a car immediately (no waiting time at all). I am not sure how busy the cars are in high season and/or weekends.I would definitely recommend trying the cable car if you want an quick birds eye perspective on Sentosa/Mount Faber area.I would probably visit again."
We just wanted to travel to Universal Studios - in the end the trip on the Cable Car was more expensive than entry in Universal Studios. There is a very long walk to the Studios after the Cable Car trip. The Cable Car trip was very good but it is very confusing.
"If you're visiting Sentosa for the day, definitely get the round trip pass. It gives you a great view of the island and also is a convenient way to go around. Plan your itinerary wisely if you'll just get a roundtrip."
A way to see this part of the city in a very different but very nice way. Lovely and very scenic views. Expensive but worth it
"nice nice view ... over the harbout overlooking the port, cruise center and into the sentosa world universal studios ...we did this after our langkawi tour-so this was a second experience for us on a sky cab :)"
We enjoyed the cable car ride. On a warm day it can get quite warm and stuffy in the cable car as they only have fans. Great views
"It so excited to go with skyway or cable car, I have tried to go with this from sentosa island to the city even my colleague feel little bit afraid. I can enjoy the view from the height, no interfence and remarkable, so you should be try it guys.."
"The cable car is a great way to access Sentosa, although look for discount ticketing as it can be expensive to buy the return trip. It offers amazing views of Singapore and if there is a cruise ship in port, you will most likely find yourself travelling straight over the top of it. This is not for the faint-hearted though, as it is quite high up. When returning at night it can be even scarier. Especially as all the windows were open and there was quite a wind so the car was blowing around quite a lot."
A great view and peaceful way to see a different perspective of the massive operations that are Sentosa Island and the harbour. If you don't like heights or potential winds moving the gondola you might think twice but having no such issues I enjoyed the experience
"took cable car from Faber Mountain to Sentosa all good but its a funny feeling travelling over buildings and ships, after a few minutes all Ok if you don't like heights, smooth trip thankfully"
We caught the cable car across to Sentosa Island after our cruise as we arrived early morning. Left our luggage at the cruise terminal for the day (luggage services L2). We purchased a round ticket with entry to Aquarium and Madame Tussauds which was good value.
We purchased combined Mt Faber and Sentosa Island tickets for $33 each. We went from Mt Faber to Sentosa and then did the Sentosa line both ways getting of at each end of the line to explore. Then back to the central point and on to the Mt Faber line to get off at Harbour Front.From our hotel Marina Bay Sands to Mt Faber was $9 by taxi and back from the Harbour Front $7 so not really worth messing about with public transport.We travelled on Saturday from 9 to 12 and had each car to ourselves but it was getting busy around 12 as we were returning.The final tower before the Sentosa Island dock is Really high so if you do not like hights !!
"This was a great way to get to Sentosa, giving you lots of view's of the bay, it was safe & enjoyable."
"Reasonable cost for a return journey on this cable car service. We really enjoyed this short, safe ride to Sentosa Island & back later in the day. Great attraction in Singapore city!"
"This is a fun way to get over to Sentosa, just be prepared to wait in long lines to get on! They were allowing huge tour groups to get on also, and it would take them a long time. They only allow 8 people to one cable car."
"One of the many 'toursity' things to do in Singapore is to ride the cable car.Our trip took us from Harbourside (only a few minutes walk from the MRT stop of the same name) over the Santosa.We visited on a quiet day, so were grateful to have a car to ourselves and took many photos as we enjoyed the views out into the harbour and back of the city.While the ride is great fun and highly recommended, the pricing structure and inclusions are a bit confusing.With the cable car servicing a number of destinations, and some tickets including entry to some attractions, I'd recommend doing your ticket type research on the website before you head off for the day."
"The lines were a bit too much, but it was worth it in the end because of the view. You rarely see Singapore from this angle. It's really beautiful to see Sentosa and the mountain leading to it in such a wonderful way. Highly recommended, but leave time for queuing."
that was so good We went across to Santona Island View was fantastic and even tho it was a bit windy felt quite safe in our little bubble
The ride was enjoyable and interesting enough. The views were majestic. The time spent was worth it. A good thing to do in singapore with friends.
"If you are hanging out by the cruise ship terminal, the cable car is the best way to get to the Sentosa Island. It is not recommended for people who are afraid of heights, as the cabins hang 60 m over the sea. I recall the ticket being a bit expensive but it covers a return trip from the middle station, to the island, back to the hills and so on. It is definitely worth it visiting the top station as well, as there are spectacular views over the city."
"What a great way to see the beautiful Singapore and Sentosa Island. Start at Mt Fabre, a hidden gem and ride the Cable Car across the harbour to Sentosa Island. Once there if you haven't already pick an attraction before you arrive there is plenty to do."
Cable car goes to the Santosa island. It is an interesting ride as it provides a good view of Singapore in general.
A nice fun-to-try attraction on the way to sentosa. Easy accessibility to mt.faber. A good experience with great city view.
"It's very safe and the cabin are new and pretty. It's a good experience but first timer with height phobia may find it scary cos the floor is made of glass as well, see through"
These cable cars are very safe and easy to get to. Love the views of the island and get to see the different resorts in the areas. Singapore is just a beautiful place to visit...
"Visited Sentosa island and decided to go back to the city with cable car. Went on the ride from one side of Sentosa to another and back, then to the city.If you have time and nothing else to do in Singapore, then its nice ride to take."
We took the stretch from Merlion station to the Imbiah Outlook station at sunset and loved it. Kids were happy with the views and the excitement of getting onto a moving cable car!
Singapore cable car is good transportation to get the sentosa island. We can see the top view of sentosa island and Singapore ship yard. You can buy the unlimited cable ride ticket and ride unlimited. The views are very nice.
"Purchased a Faber License membership to enjoy unlimited cable car rides and also pass on 50% discount to others coming with me. The views are amazing. Never actually had to line-up or share a cabin with any other people. The cable car doesn't seem to get that much attention as other cable cars in other countries, it's a shame."
We took a day trip and used the cable car to get to the top of the hill Merlion Park I think it was....we then went over to Sentosa. The cable car is easily accessible by bus and we had a bit of fun...most of the travel made use of the several cable cars that are offer...
"Cool views over SG and near islands. Its smooth, safe and stunning views will appear for you. Easy to get in and once on the main land you can make a nice hike to Hendersons bridge. Go in the air to see Singapore at its best"
"It isn't a very long ride out to Sentosa Island, but along the way, you get great views of the island and great views of Singapore behind you."
Great experience.The rest of my family went to Sentosa.I returned back.You have to catch a cab to the starting point.Found it annoying at every stop the tickets being marked
"If you have a day and want to go to Santosa, then go to Mt Faber and take the full cable car trip. Suggest you book on line first and save upwards of 20% off the standard price."
With this cable car you will pass above the water. You can enjoy and take picture of Sentosa Island and Singapore Ports. It was a nice experience.
Worth to try if you are heading Sentosa island. I've been high earlier but never in cable car over the water :) You get easily a picture of Sentosa and and Singapore Ports from this point of view.
This was another excellent experience. The trick is to some how get the glass bottom car. The experience of going over things is great. Well worth doing.
We just rode the two sets of cable cars. Didn't bother to see any of the sights at each stops. Very relaxing way to get over jet lag.
"well what to say about Cable car ride.we did enjoy a lot.had a great time.we laid back & enjoyed the spectacular view of the country from the top.If you are going to sentosa,don't miss to take cable car.there are lot of activities to do at Sentosa.From 4D show to adventure island & underwater world everything is such amazing.one will definitely enjoy a whole day at sentosa & will never get bored.I have visiting singapore 2nd time & never miss sentosa Island.the best attraction at Sentosa is Lazar show as songs of the sea. the beaches at sentosa are great & you will really enjoy party there as we did."
"This is one of the ways to reach sentosa and the most expensive one too.If you travel frequently to Sentosa ,then the boardwalk or sentosa express is recommended but do try this atleast once...The views are really good and you get to see Sentosa island from the top which u cannot otherwise..."
Great views. We used the cable car to travel from the Mount to Sentosa Island. Probably worth visiting if in Singapore.
This was a fun ride across the harbour from Sentoca Island to the main land. We were there to watch the laser light show and came upon this cable car by accident so we thought lets go and we loved it.
We were pushed for time so this was an excellent way to see Sentosa and worth buying the return ticket. Sentosa would have taken a long time to walk otherwise so seeing the aerial view was great. Great photo opportunity too and you could stop off for a quick walk on the beach or for some food.
Cozy laid-back way to enjoy the spectacular view of the country from the top. The tram ride is definitely worthwhile and it is also convenient to commute from one place to another.
"Gives a beautiful view of the entire city. If you are afraid of heights like me, and avoided flyer, this is better, as unlimited ride comes as package."
Very pleasant experience with the Singapore cable car: it's a touristic attraction and also a mode of tranportation to go from one spot to another in Sentosa island. The cabins are spacious and you feel safe. The views over the harbourfront and Sentosa are breathtaking! I went up to Mount Faber first. And then went to Sentosa. A must-do
"Great cable car, it's very high from the earth, you can see Singapore and Sentosa very well, advise you to go"
The cable car system in Sentosa island is both a tourist attraction and mode of transportation to get from one place to another. Good view when you get up there.
"Decided to get the annual pass for $135. This wasn't the most efficient process, but once you have it you're set for the year and it gives access to the original cable car and the newer line across Sentosa. Great views. Better to visit in the morning to avoid the crowds."
"If we want aerial views of Singapore then this is a must do activity but if you are scared of heights it will be a challenge, particularly in windy weather. Definitely the best way to travel to Sentosa!"
View is spectacular and seat is spacious compare to the old ones but not the best in the world. For Singapore it is good enough.Good for family including toddlers and old adults to be in the cable car as the speed is at a comfortable timing and each station staff offer helpful information and also friendly
It's a good option to go towards Sentosa. I sat in it once but it's nothing extra-ordinary. Yes it offers good views but that's expected.. isn't it?
"We took a return trip to Sentosa Island ' it's great to take a 15 min ride above the port, especially if you like ship spotting. You can also use the cable car to travel along the Island between the various attractions or take the long tour to the mountain. We saw people having lunch in the cars while traveling so it's another idea of how to enjoy both a meal and a ride in the sky.We got a day ticket with iVenture pass so admission was free for us."
Easy way to see parts of Sentosa Island and you can map out where things are. Also the ticketing place has special on for all the activities.
"Took the cable car ride from Mt Faber to Sentosa, we reached around 11am and there was no queue at all. If there is long queue, they will put max 8ppl in 1 cabin, since no queue four of us just took 1 cabin. During the ride from Mt Faber, you can see trees at first, then the harbourfront area with cruise ships and ferries. Passing by the Harbourfront, on the way to Sentosa, you can see apartments, Resort world, sentosa cove and the dolphin lagoon - we were able to see dolphins jumping out of water too. There was no aircond in the cabin, so during sunny hot day, be prepared to sweat and the small fans in the cabin don't have any effect at all. Overall, we enjoy the ride very much."
Very well run and operated. Great views looking out to Sentosa Island. This is a great family activity.
It was a nice ride on the island. The highlight was seeing a parked Cruise Liner and the view from the top.
I am living in Singapore and had not ride the cable car since I was a little kid. Took my 6 year old on his cable car ride as he insisted.It was nice to see familiar scenes from above like the Adventure Cove waterpark.I bought the Mount Faber and Sentosa line package. We got down at every single station and walk around. Nice way to spend an afternoon. Located different places to visit when I next drive into Sentosa.
Make sure you start the journey at Mount Fabre at the very start of the cable car. It's worth going to the very end to see the recreation of the artillery positions
Great way to get an aerial view of downtown Singapore. Nice vistas and picture opportunities. For the family.
"The cable cars were very clean, it was March 2020 and the start of Covid 19 so was very quiet - no queues. Straight on and off the cars and had the car to ourselves - in fact at times think we had the whole line to ourselves. Staff were really good too.However - it was just a bit boring, not much to see or do. We got off and went to sentosa which looked ok, but nothing special. We went on the zip line there which was amazing, again no queue at all - straight on it. But all felt a bit of a let down to be honest. Worth doing if you have time to kill - but if not, then don't waste your time"
Car was a little tight with wheelchair & 2 people. Lift to platform was out of order on one station and another station was closed for construction. Disappointed overall.
The cable car is the best way to get to Sentosa Island. You can get a single or round trip and visit all of the stops.The cars are very smooth and you get some great views. It's a good way to spend time in Singapore. Would recommend going in the morning before it gets too hot.
"The cable car is the most scenic, but also the most expensive way to go to Sentosa island. The bus service is the better way unless you desparately want prictures of Sentosa from above"
Good experience and fun in Cable car.It is quite safe and the drive is not so long.To go to Sentsa is very much comfortable journey.
used it to get to SENTOSA.. did not use from peak which would be more spectacular.. good view over water/docks/ bayside etc ...
"A rather spectacular way to get to Singapore's big entertainment island Sentosa is to take the long cable car from the 'mainland'. The ride itself is beautiful with great views of the island and the entrance to the city. Exciting for the youngest and relaxing for the adults. The stations at each end are quite anonymous and breathe a little 'tourist trap', but fulfill their function. However, getting a ticket can be a real gamble!I had pre-booked a ticket from home before going to Singapore. Once in front, I went subway to a station near the cable car, then received guidance from various signs about where the ticket office was located (in a building just below the station itself). I knew earlier from the email I had received that my e-ticket had to be changed on the spot to a real ticket. Ok, nothing strange about it. Upon arriving at the ticket office, I was informed that it was not possible to change the ticket to a real one (!) But that I had to visit the nearby shopping center on floor three. The information turned out to be wrong - no ticket counter was on floor three, but they directed me (via the roof!) To the building next door where there was finally a small ticket door where they could change the ticket to a real ... Walk back all the way to the cable car's departure hall - where I was told that the ticket was not valid but in turn had to be changed precisely on the cable car's own ticket box. Elevator down, stand in line and well ahead: a new ticket! Back up to the cable car - and finally - off! It took me 90 minutes to solve a problem that could have been rectified with the right information from the beginning. I experienced this a couple more times on my travel, so if you buy a ticket from home in advance, check properly if the ticket is valid on the spot and - if not - where you exchange it on the spot. I had plenty of time and the weather was still bad, so it didn't matter to me personally this time other than to marvel at the inferior information and choice of solutions in place. Unfortunately, my experience lowers the rating by one star."
Nothing exciting except that you can have views of Singapore city. You can take train to Sentosa which is much cheaper.
"Travelled from Sentosa island on the cable car. The $25 one way ticket is expensive, as most tourist sites in Singapore are, but it was a nice trip with fabulous views. Started from the Sinoso beach area, after getting the free shuttle bus from the Sentosa light rail station. Short walk from the end of the cable car to the light rail station Harbour Front."
views are nice. i like the one over sentosa better. to mount faber was okay. expensive for short ride
"Everything in Singapore has an X factor associated with it, somehow it was missing in this experience.First getting to Faber Hill or Harbour point is a challenge and then the cable car ride is only for some 10 odd minutes, which is hardly exhilarating.Getting to Sentosa on metro or by road is easier"
"I hate heights but these cable cars were pretty good. Great views of the city and Sentosa, particularly as the sun, was going down. Avoid paying extra for the dinner unless you pay for the $288 dinner, but to be honest I can't rate that one as I didn't have it. The dinner we had was cold, all small meals consisted of chicken (I dislike chicken) but I tried it anyway, but it was not to my liking. Other than the dinner it was a pretty good ride even for those that hate heights"
"Lovely views of Sentosa and the surrounding waters. A fun way to explore, and an interesting new perspective of the landscape.On the downside: a little expensive, and the cars aren't air-conditioned so they can get hot & stuffy.Worth doing once, but not sure it's something I'd do again."
It has changed throughout the years. I preferred the koi pond and the free cafe to sit with family and friends. Now a greedy man has bought it and now you need to pay to sit. + cable cars are $$$. The drive there gives you just as nice of a view and its FREE :)
The view was nice but it wasn't worth $33 sg dollars. The car doesn't have ac so it was stuffy. I would save your money and look for cheaper ways to get to the island.
"If you have ever been to cairns in Australia in their cable car this would be over prices and a wast of time, I wish I just caught a cab it would of been $300 cheaper"
"the kids was so happy, everythings look good from the above and the cable car was convenience too.. good experince afterall."
"Singapore is always hot and worst of all, the cable car is not air conditioned and it is extremely stuffy and hot inside. Regret taking this cable car."
you get a great view of singapore especially sentosa island. You see more than you would otherwise . its a good family thing to do. You get ideas of what to see next too.
"I didn't find the view spectacular. It's really quite short and expensive (I mean, think about actually great views, or on a ski lift for example).And let's not forget in recent history a ship tore one of these cars off the cable. FACT.Maybe I'm just not a cable car guy.I would be so bold as to say The Cable Guy with Jim Carrey was more memorable. Even with Giles bringing beers along for the ride.Maybe I should just lay cable.HINT: so as your day doesn't just revolve around this cable, why not add a Southern Ridges walk, including Henderson Waves and gelato and art at Gillman Barracks. Tag the cable on just for bucket lists or something."
"Singapore doesn't have high hills, so a cable car ride cannot be spectacular. It does provide interesting views of Sentosa's development, and this activity is enjoyable for young children. If you were to join, might as well take it from Mt. Faber to Sentosa (rather than just the portion between Harbourfront and Sentosa), as otherwise it would be too short a ride. Surprisingly, they don't sell one-way tickets. This is annoying as the only way to find transport at Mt. Faber Station is via Grab."
"Singapore is not ""hilly""and although the cars are nice with windows in the floor you can now get to Sentosa by many methods unlike before. In addition to do the most interesting route leaving from Fraser's Hill you have to make a special journey there. Unless you fancy a walk and then well you will enjoy the leisurely glide down! You do get a good view of the port and cruise centre on the way across."
"Can't buy one way passes. The view is nice but the inside of the cable cars are not air conditioned. On the main ride to and from santosa, you have to share the car usually b/c it seats up to 8. When you get to the island, there isn't much need to ride the inter-island cable cars. The fee you pay at the beginning includes all this. The price on this website is out dated. It's even more- it was $105 Singaporean dollars for 3 of us. We went on the intra island one just to get our money's worth. There are cheaper ways to get to and from the island- save your money for other stuff on the island- everything on this island is very expensive!"
This was an average experience for me. I would recommend the flyer wheel vs the cable car. I used this to reach Sentosa island. However on reaching Sentosa island I had to walk a lot to reach aquarium which became difficult for me with small kids and elderly.
Very expensive way to get to sentosa- not a bad view but not worth the money. Sales staff rather aggressive in their sales tactics.Wouldn't do it again or recommend
"this is way to expensive for what it is $38S , you get just a short trip over and back and it just not worth it"
The cable car was fun for a one time experience. It gives you a nice view of the surrounding area. The operators were careful not to overcrowd the cable cars. My husband and I had a car to ourselves on the way to Sentosa. We went mid afternoon and all the glass from the cable car windows made it very hot & uncomfortable inside the car
Our views may be tainted as we have done the Rain Forests Cairns and Table Top Capetown. Just seemed to be in the wrong place unless you like container ships. We did not do the full trip as got a bit bored. Saw Dolphins in the theme park. I think the idea is to stop off at the other attractions rather than views.
"Smooth ride, well maintained, good direction displays, staff helping, good ambience. Really liked by whole family."
"Not a fan of the cable car. The views are OK, but nothing spectacular. I have ridden a number of cable cars around the world and this is my least favorite so far. First they try to cram the cars full and insisted we get in with other people making it uncomfortable and hard to look around. There is also no AC in the cars and the fans there were not working making it even less comfortable. Given the price I have higher expectations. We paid over $18 USD per person. We actually opted out from riding it back even though our tickets were round trip as it was just not a nice experience."
"Looks good if you like this sort of thing, but You get better views from Skypark. And you can do this trip by local bus for Â£1 with free return."
Easy to access from the harbour beside the cruise centre. There are several stops but not all are worth getting off at. The view is great and it gives a different perspective of the city. It's interesting if you are in the vicinity or want to escape the heat.
"Was very confusing to find where to catch it from outside Universal Studios , We asked so many people walking around and no one knew. We asked some ground staff and got the run around time and time again. Finally we got there and with 5 min to spare before the closing time. We did it at night .Will go back again one day when we visit Singapore but do in the daytimeKids would love this too."
"It is such a magnificent ride , unfortunately it is not managed properly and so the queuing system is totally mismanaged and children find it very difficult to manage this especially during humid months."
You can pay $35 to get access to Mount Faber on the main island and to get over to Sentosa island and then all the stops on Sentosa island. Or if you don't particularly want to use the other stops on Sentosa and are happy to walk around you can save yourself $2 which doesn't make much sense!Make sure you go earlier in the day as at night you can't necessarily see much of the scenery below or into the distance. Especially the trip to Mount Faber is not worth it at night.We only did it as we'd paid to use both lines.
"Ridiculously priced at $35 dollars each, plus we wanted to go to the aquarium so we were charged $71 each. If we'd been more astute we could have bought the aquarium tickets online for a lot less and travelled on the cheaper monorail to the aquarium. You live and learn."
I wouldn't put it at the top of your list... It is a little out of the way as you need to get to it from the old Harbor front mall. The cars are not air conditioned either. There is not really much to do at the top. Best to do it first thing in the morning before it gets too hot.
"This is a good way to get to Sentosa, the Metlion and back. There is no single ticket so if you only want a one way it will cost you 33Singapore Dollars, not too bad for a return journey"
"If you have done skiing in Europe or elsewhere, you are very used to use this kind of cable cars. I was not impressed by this one. It was promoted as a beautiful view.To me it's not so special, im sorry. Sentosa it attached to the commercial port of Singapore, and I'm not interested in seeing douzens of tankers waiting to dock.It's also terribly expensive. To me it was just a fancy way to move from A to B, and it cost a pretty penny as i was with my family and friends. In my opinion it is not a worth entertaintment for a family"
"We visited on Sunday, to access Sentosa for the day. Very very busy, don't bother to access from Faber Point, lots of coach trips and the queues were massive, with the staff manning the cars themselves more interested with their phones than their jobs.Access is better from Harbour Front, no queues and if you want to take in the views go up from there to Faber Point and don't get off, just stay in the car for a round trip.We purchased a day pass for 2 adults, so we could jump on and off through the day and evening (views are phenomenal at night)Views are breathtaking, it feels really safe and is really clean. 8 people to a car, but we never had more than 4 on any trip.Well worth doing, recommended!"
"It is 14 minutes ride from Mount Faber Peak to Sentosa, A good view of the entire city and sentosa can be seen from here"
The cable car is similar to other cable car rides but the view from the car will make people say wow. The cost is higher for this 3 minutes ride. kids might enjoy.
"We have been to Sentosa before and this time we wanted to try the cable car and to be really honest I just can't justify if it were worth the cost. Especially considering there is no air conditioningOur ticket cost us $55 each which gave us unlimited cable cart rides and choice of 2 activities. We were heading to Sentosa for the segways so that ticket type worked for usBut it would have been much cooler, cheaper and easier to have just got a taxi and paid separately for the segwayI am just not sure if the view was worth it"
We purchased a ticket which included lunch at the Spud & Apron and the cable car itself. Whilst the cable car got us to the island the other half on the island was closed.Spud & Apron food choice was very poor and not worth getting the deal.
"It used to pull in the crowds in the earlier years, BUT as time goes by it is now NOT in the MINDS of most tourists and locals. This could be due to the reason that there are so many easy and cheaper ways to go to SENTOSA, Nothing fantastic over the short ride from Faber Hill to the island and visa versa. Too many cable rides around the world and in asia, offering much more exciting rides at better prices! The management is trying HARD to gain clients offering dinning in the cab...etc, amongst other things. GOOD LUCK to them !!!"
The Sentosa line didn't work on the day we visited. Bit annoyed that we were still sold a ticket that included the full price for both lines.
Went over to Sentosa for the day which was lovely to see the sites. Disappointingly the cable car on the island was closed for scheduled maintenance.We took the car up to the point and did the whole cable journey onto the island. We set off around 11am so lucky to have a cable car to ourselves.
"Fun way to see Sentosa island and also travel on the island to its tip, as well as visiting Mt Faber in the other direction. Got the round trip ticket that covered a trip to each station and cost $32. Lots of ticket options with some including theme park tickets. Queue was small and never had to wait long to get on a gondola but as the day wears on it got busier so look to start early. Mine had air con and you could take pictures out of a small window of the various views. You are in an industrial harbour area so the sites are not that special but good nonetheless. Sentosa island is such a fun place it is a must to use this mode of transportation in my opinion."
"Look to be honest i wouldn't bother doing this again. Its pricey and a short trip to Sentosa. Make sure you get your tickets at the bottom before you go up otherwise you have to go back down again, despite having bought tickets online. So if you have bought tickets online beforehand, please line up downstairs first."
"There are two lines to do, the faber line to take you from the harbour front and back the other Sentosa line a little sightseeing across the island.The price seems steep if you just want to get to the island and the shuttle is probably better.Whilst high up the views are underwhelming, so much building work is being done along with passing next to a major import shipping hub just allows you to see endless rows of shipping containers and some men pouring concrete.There is nothing in the cars or before to tell you what you are looking towards and indeed one end of the line seems to have nothing to get off and see.For me a waste of time and money"
The $35 list price is excessive if you just want to get to Sentosa Island and their are plenty of cheaper ways to do so. It's better to see this as a ride where you get to see the city from a different point of view. Pick up a discounted ticket on Klook to take a bit of the sting out of the pricing and you're good to go.
"We started from Mt. Faber to Sentosa in the morning. There is a package offered that includes some of the attractions offered in Sentosa. However, the information provided is not always up to date.The view was really nice on the ride. We did the return trip to Harborfront, which was also nice."
You take the cable car which take you above the harbour. There is bell of happiness which you can ring !!!
Got the cable car back over to the mainland from Sentosa $33?. Took about 10 minutes if that. No commentary. Waste of money.
"So this was a solo trip that I was taking to Thailand and had booked myself on Singapore Airlines, the good things is that one can opt for something called as Singapore Stopover Holiday - which for travellers from India costs about USD78, and you get accommodation, and lots of entry passes at Singapore including the cable care ride. Best is if one wants to save time get to the Maritime Square Tower 2, to get on to the cable car & you can ride this to get into Sentosa. Now the thing is read clearly for signs which says queue for redemption. And these are not so usually easy to find on many of these pass inclusions that SSH has. And its just a cable car, if you have a child in you, maybe you could ride it, get some views of passing over some of the bay areas, and over a bit of Sentosa, otherwise give this a skip. You could also think of this as a ride to Sentosa as it would other wise cost you time and money too. Nothing really great about it though. While coming back you can either come back to the same place, look if your pass says round way, if it does (which is the case with SSH pass holders) then you can come back to the same location you started the ride and take a taxi. I rather took a cab from Sentosa, as it cost me the same to get back to my hotel from Sentosa directly, just saved on some time."
"I wouldn't say this is a ""must-see"", however, if you want to visit the beach in Singapore, then I would recommend the Cable Car as a way to get there with some nice views along the way. The experience is unique, but a lot of the views are quite industrial. Take a look at my photos to see what I mean."
We caught the cable car to Sentosa - the ride was brief and there was a view of the marina on the way. The operation seems to run smoothly with little or no queues.
Getting to the station of the cable car is not so convenient. The fare is rather expensive! and should you go from Santosa back to the waterfront be aware of getting a taxi as the queue can be very very long...we waited for more than an hour before we could get one to go back to the hotel...tiring....
"Not a patch on the Lankawi car in Malaysia, but worth a trip to say you've done it. Walked back from Sentosa along the Boardwalk, which was more enjoyable to be honest!"
"WE had this ride as part of package. Not too exited, too much cost and west of time, If we new, we could have gone to gardens directly and save some time.,"
Really nice views of Sentosa island going in but it is a shame you must buy a return ticket since it's a nice walk back to Vivo center over the boardwalk. Expensive.
"Views are good, but not worth the price you have to pay for it. Can only buy a return ticket so there is no way of getting the ticket any cheaper."
I know this cable car short after they finished it when I lived there in Singapore as 'Expat'. It is a comfortable way to reach 'Sentosa Island'
"We were unable to buy a single way ticket and had to buy return, which was annoying. Probably a bit expensive for what it is, online tickets are much cheaper. The views are very good though."
Singapore cable car to enter and exit Sentosa is one of the ways to commute to Sentosa. I personally felt its quite pricey and not worth. rather during the same month i visited Langkawi and i have never ever had a chance to experience one of the longest and most amazing cable cars ever that i had in Langkawi. So i could easily compare that Singapore cable car isn't worth the money and the short duration. I would rather take Sentosa express or walk to enter and exit Sentosa.
"Guys I apologise in advance, my review might sound a bit negative for some of you given the amazing trip adviser rating for this attraction on this site. I am trying to remain unbiased during writing this review but I do need to highlight how miserable my day was probably due to some bad decisions I made along the way. So first and foremost if this is the first time you are getting on a cable car then yeah you will definitely like it. But bear in mind the ride is short... like really really short it kindda finishes before it starts. They will try to make you share the cable car with others and can fit upto 8 people in one cable car! Tried to do fit 6 passengers and a buggy with us during one of our journey. It was the most uncomfortable 3/4 mins ride in the 30 degrees heat. There is no aircon so yeah be prepared to be steamed in the heat. Although i must mention there were some weak air ventilation. If you are the second group on-boarding the cars you are most certainly going to be sitting facing the opposite direction of travel and going to miss the view. If thats ok with you considering the bucks you will be paying then yeah these are no big deal. Now the big mistake I made that ruined my day...i bought cable car return tickets from my hotel concierge, trying to be clever and avoid long queues but didn't realise this was actually voucher and not tickets. So when I went to the cable car station they sent us to the monorail office to collect tickets. This was about 20 mins walk through two shopping malls, then another 10 mins queue to redeem the tickets from the desk then 15 mins walk back to the harbourfront station. I would recommend you buy the tickets directly from the station and avoid all the extra hassle if you can. Now somehow while getting back to the station I lost my tickets, must have dropped somewhere, this never happened to me before. I went to the ticket desk to ask if they can help me in this situation, they basically told me to bugger off! Spoke to the tour company who issued the vouchers they weren't helpful either. I was really surprised a big company like sentosa doesn't have any system in place to assist genuine customers in this kind of situation. I had all my other papers with me showing i paid etc. How difficult was it for them to track and ticket they issued against the vouchers and block it and reissue new ones. No idea! They sympathised and was polite but basically didn't help me at all. Lesson for me get digital tickets where I can! Given I was there for few days I repurchased the tickets and went to sentosa. But didn't enjoy the whole experience Probably because I was let down a bit by this whole dramatic incident and ended up spending â¬132 for what a 15/20 mins cable car ride for two. A return trip will cost you $33 singapore dollars."
"Take the cable car from Mt Faber only if you want to see the view (which is spectacular). Otherwise, there are cheaper ways of getting to Sentosa, like walking along the boardwalk or taking the monorail or the bus. Good to do in the evening to take in the city and harbour lights."
Get on from Sentosa line and and than transferred to the Mount Faber line. I think very good opportunity to see sentosa like birds..Comparing to the distance you traveled a bit pricey.. Welcome to the Singapore)))Check website before taking tickets..there are combined packages and quite hours discounts. Like after 6 pm cheaper..Have good time..
Typical cable car with views of the area. Ok to once when in the area. The Sentosa section is very short.
"The cable car over to Sentosa is shorter in distancethan it seems, and is very expensive for the short ride it offers. There are far less expensive ways of getting to Sentosa, and I would recommend taking one of them, such as car, taxi or bus."
"We got the cable car from Harbour Front to Sentosa for a few hours on the island. Then on the way back, went all the way up to Mount Faber. The Sentosa and Mount Faber ends of the cable car have facilities such as gift shops, cafes, etc. But the Harbour Front area is relatively non-descript - although this may be because it is next to a large shopping centre.A great way to begin and end a trip to Sentosa.My only complaint was that ordering a taxi at Mount Faber proved impossible without a Singapore based mobile phone. So we walked down - which was hot, but pleasant."
"We took the cable car from Sentosa Island to the city late evening.The view was decent; with the city lights, traffic, bay and the buildings; but it was nothing special.One could easily give it a miss.."
"It is just a simple cable car ride connecting Sentosa Island to the mainland. It might be interesting for kids, but it is generally boring in nature."
"The view is ok, the cabin inside does not allow for great picture taking.But it is a convenient way to go to sentosa and I guess quite fun too."
It is expensive to go up to Mount Faber in the cable car. It is nothing special gives a different view of Singapore.The park is good but it was so humid up there that it was unpleasant.
Nothing really special except that you get a birds eye view of Singapore mainland and the approaching Sentosa Island when you go via the Cable car.
Went there on a recommendation from a fellow tourist and also because I went to eat at 328 Katong Laksa. It was close walking distance from there. It was a very cloudy day with rain so not an ideal day to visit. Lots of families in the area.
"You can take the MRT but better still is the cable car for transport to Sentosa where you'll find amusement park activities, hotel, and casino. This is a getaway for Singapore."
Walked in circles trying to figure out where to board the cable car. On boarding the wind was stronger than usual and we ended up freaked out from the experience. One time is enough. Thanks.
Ok.. experience.. you could take it or leave it..Lots of others things in Singapore that I felt were more worthwhile spending money on!
Had a fabulous view of the sea. The ascension was a bit scary when the cable car started swaying a bit sidewards. It spiced the journey...Overall was nice.
"If you have been to cable car elsewhere around in your country or other places, just skip this expensive one. Not worth the money and time. Views are fine, not something worth memory."
It's a 30 minute round trip from Sentosa to Many thanks Faber which is the 2nd highest point on Singapore. Good views of the docks and shipping on the ride. Gets v busy at weekends
"there is nothing special , but city looks good an all clearv view can be observed, in day time its worth"
We enjoyed our dining experience on the cable car however I will make a few comments it is not a 4 course dinner as 1st course is a shared bowl of nuts with champagne before hopping on and I don't call that a course. I chose the fish it was delicious all 3 mouth fulls my dinner was such a small serving while my husband chose the steak which was also delicious and a very generous serving desert also delicious. When I think of a fine dining experience I think white table cloth maybe a flower on the table not a plastic tray. Having paid $374( as we had a glass of wine extra) I was left disappointed and very hungry
"and have to say. Can do, but mustn't Nothing special. Ok, the view is not bad, but that's it. Start and End of the Cable Car is not easy to reach. Only Taxi or by walk."
The cable car from mainland to sentosa island is an exciting prospect and affordable. Worth going once..
"The ticket for cable car is S$29, and it is a round trip deal. If one only wants to go to Sentosa on the cable car but walk back to mainland, the return ticket will be wasted. Only round ticket ticket is available. Inland ticket covering just the Sentosa portion costs S$13, which I didn't think it's worth it. The island isn't big; one can easily cover it all on foot.Overall, I don't find the cable car worth the price."
"Thought very overpriced for what it was. We only wanted to go to Vivo city t than catch train but the ticket price was to Sentosa Island. Would definely recommend the restuarant at Mt Faber - Faber Bistro. Cocktails pretty good too. The walk around for the""""bell of happiness"" is a good photo opportunity as well."
"Bring my kids here by Nov 2016. The view from Mt. Faber was great. But other than that, there is nothing much to do here."
Its good for time pass. You will get special discount if you travel after 6 pm. Its the perfect time as you can see both day and night view.
"I find its stupid to spend money on this, Its better you take mono rail from Vivo city mall and reach to you desired location at santosa. Cable car did not add fun to my experience."
"The cable car ride to the island of Sentosa was an excellent experience. The cars were clean and tidy and staff were very friendly and helpful and were always seemed to be enjoying their work. You can also catch the mono- rail to the island but the aerial views over the island are, well, not the best pictures you can take from a cable car because of all the shipping waiting to dock in Singapore Harbour, but you can get some shots. A great ride. Been there done that. 5/10."
We did the ' fine' dining experience in the cable car ride last night and were very disappointed with the soup and main course of grilled Angus beef. We have never known Angus beef to have so much fat. There was hardly any potatoes or vegetables either. The rest of the meal wasn't too bad. A shame the soup and the main course spoiled the dining experience. The price was far too dear for the experience.
It's just a normal ride you take from point A to point B but it comes with great view of the Sentosa and Harbourfront.I wouldnt tell you to expect a lot but it is a memorable ride.
Get some good views and makes travelling to and from Sentosa easy. Can be a bit pricey though. We got a day pass but did not really need it as a one way journey on both the lines is ample to cover all grounds - unless you are staying on the Island and plan to go to mainland and come back. Then its worth it.
"The trip over gives you some really great views but.... if you intend to purchase one of the packages that allow you to go to attractions, be VERY CAREFUL as some of the major one's are NOT included and despite what they tell you, you won't now positively till you front up."
The cable car departs from Mount Faber which doesn't have good transit links or taxi's that frequent. It costs $29 to ride round trip as they don't offer one way fares. For $31 you can ride the cable car to the island then once on the island you can ride the other one. We randomly grabbed a map that offered a $3 discount on the dual cable car so both that. When we asked if there were taxi's that could pick us up from Mount Faber they told us to get off at Vivo city mall. There weren't many people there that day so we had the cable car to ourselves. It's a nice ride with a great view. Once on the island we decided to go exploring before getting on the other cable car. We went to both beaches and when we tried to find where to pick up the other cable car as we were tired it was nowhere close to where we were. We finally just jumped on the free tram that went from the island to Vivo city. Save your money for buying a drink at the top of Marina Bay Sands!!
The cable car ride is for very short time. U pay a handsome amount for 15 mins max. Its too much. Others got in inside ur car. You have to share with others.
"While in Singapore we had to ride the cable car, not a cheap outing but we brought the ticket that covered all the cable car rides. We did not want to actually do anything on Sentosa Island but thought a birds eye view would be nice. We also went to Mount Faber and had a walk up the hill, took some lovely photos looking back at Singapore. It is a nice relaxing way to see the views from above. Both places have somewhere to eat and drink so you will not go without while exploring."
I would like to say this was a good experience but it wasn't for us. It started with pretty poor customer service and then getting onboard during a thunderstorm. Unfortunately the cable car broke down and we were hanging there for quite a long time. Once it got going again it was very slow and it took forever to get to Sentosa. I think it gives you good views but don't go during bad weather!
"Bit pricey, but a nice relaxing way to get yourself to Sentosa. The views are nice, but doesn't offer anything new to those who have been in a cable car before"
"Not worth the time or the money. Spent half a day taking the cable cars from mount Faber to Sentosa island, did the internal Sentosa islan cable car ride as well. Mount Faber was a joke. Ridiculous and a waste of time and money. The ride to Sentosa island and the internal ride was not as bad, however I think this experience would have been better had we taken the ride in evening."
Not the cheapest mode of transport but it is enjoyable for a day. The views are fantastic and the all day pass lets you have flexibility. Not much at Mt Faber so hopped on the delightfully clean gondola and went back to Viva
Cable car should take at night and the view out of the cable car is beautiful. The sea view is nice and you can sit back and enjoy the scenery very relaxing.
It is a great view to Sentosa Island. It is also a very convenient way to go to the famous Sentosa Island.
"As with everything in Singapore it was expensive. If you include the Sentosa ""package"" then hideously expensive ($101)!I would not recommend going to Universal Studios"" unless you have deep pockets & a long life expectancy (queues for rides were 40-80 minutes). Good for kids I guess - good luck mum & dad!!"
"We went for the ride on the evening of 19 May,2017. It was okay riding in a car above the trees and water but it was no thrill or excitement. It was just like any other ride."
"It's a cable car experience you will find similar with other cable cars. More expensive, too short ride and nothing new."
"Very expensive way to travel, but of course once in the day and once in the night is enough for a good view of the island. And for the thrill.Of course, there's the glass top one, not for those scared of heights, which is interesting. A little pricey as well, so do go to Carousell or Groupon and wait for their discounts and offers."
"You can catch Singapore Cable Car at the Harbourfront. Ticketing is extremely and painfully slow. For S$33, you can ride both the Mount Faber Line and Sentosa Line (both ways for those two lines). It starts on the 16th floor of the building and go over the city. It is quite a view."
"Riding a cable car might not be strange to someone. But for us, it was a great time enjoyed together above the sea level. The original price of the ticket is kinda expensive but we got a contact who sells with discount price. So, we bought tickets for Harbourfront Station to Mount Faber (Round) and Harbourfront to Sentosa Station (Round). First, you need to go to Habourfront Tower which you can ride MRT (Circle and Purple LIne). Then, head to Mount Faber First and if you want to spend sometimes there, get out off the cable car and enjoy the picturesque view. There was a souvenir shop, too. After that, go back to cable car station and take a ride to Sentosa Station via Harbourfront Station. For us, we did not get out of the cable car and took ride to Sentosa. But, one of the family who got out of the car need to get in again with our cable car to sentosa station. Whatever, we enjoyed the ride with them, too. We are amazed by the color of the sea which is very clean and green. Moreover, you can see some private boats along the shore. For the line of Harbourfront to Mount Faber, you can enjoy the green views which is the mountain sides. For your information, there is a new cable car line to Sentosa Merlion (I don't know where it starts.) Enjoy your ride if you are in Lion City!"
"I was not surprised in this as I had a great experience in Kashmir valley right in Himalyas"" Gulmarg""."
Great views from Mt Faber as you cross to Sentosa. Wasn't a fan of Sentosa and found the cable car a little over priced for what it was. Didn't like the cheesy photo also which they insist on taking...
"I have been on cable car at several places including Hong Kong, Hakone in Japan etc. I consider them superior to this due to their better views, long duration and cost effective too.Nothing bad about this but SG is in general expensive. Good view of Sentosa island and harbor."
"The cable car leaves mount Faber and goes across to Sentosa. I must say I do struggle a little with the artificial feel of Sentosa, its seems a little infantile. However the cable car was timely, relaxing and the children liked it."
"The ride wasn't bad. It's really high, and you get to Sentosa easily. It can get really hot inside of those cabins so I wouldn't advise it if it's a sunny day."
The ride was good and views nice. Inside no aircon a bit discomforting.on top really nothing to see and to do.A bit expensive.
"The cable cars are a great way to get views from Mount Faber and Sentosa, but that's pretty much it. That being said, they are really great views."
"Great view (albeit short) and quick to get to the island and back, but just a quick cable car ride. The island is extremely touristy, just keep that in mind"
It was ok and fairly safe but I hate heights. I don't recommend it if you hate heights. But I guess it's ok.
Normally cable cars are for the places where there is no easy access for other mode of transport. But Singapore cable cars is just for tourist attraction where we can easily go to Santosa with Car or Train. But view from Cable Cars is nice and if you take around 8 PM you can see firework from water fountain show.
"If you're going to Sentosa, the cable car is one of the many options yet most expensive. TWO cable car lines that connect TWO locations ' Sentosa and Faber Peak Singapore. We decided to ride the cable car to see Singapore from above, capture photos beyond and able to see it in different angels.We were only interested to go to Mount Fabre but the ticket was also valid for Sentosa. the ride was short and not a fun ride. The cable car in Hong Kong to ngong ping village hong kong way a lot better. When we reach yo Mount Faber Peak we were not impress it wasn't worthy. When you reached to the peak you can see a lot, we spent 10-15mins and headback...The only thing we enjoyed during the ride when we passed the Harbour. The visibility was poor and totally Overpriced!!! it was a good day but doesn't meet our expectations!"
"Nice views of the bay, but expensive think it was $28 return ticket from Harbour Front to Sentosa, worth doing once to tick off your bucket list."
"You can capture the full city and the Island Sentosa from this Cable car. It's a bit expensive, i felt though considering the short length of the trip. good to go in Groups/couples."
We went across on the cable car and had no trouble but we were told there as been a few accidents and people have been killed but they seem confident that they have sorted problems and everything is safe
"Ride the cable cars for great views of the city. Stop and have a meal or drink. Very commercial, but fun none the less."
"Beautiful views , however nothing special , much better and more interesting things to see and do in Singapore ... I personally wouldn't recommend it .."
"If you dont have anything else to do in Sentosa, take this ride, It will give you views of the Sentosa and Singapore from the top. Its a short ride though as it ends in like apprx 15mins"
"If you really want to have an experience of seeing Singapore from a little way above while at the same time also wanting to go to Sentosa Island in a lavish way, this is your choice. Better to take it while the sun was up, though."
Nice views from the cable cars as you would expect but the non-airconditioned gondolas are steaming hot in the Singapore sun and the ticket price is high compared to going to Sentosa by regular transport.
"you can take the cable car to visit stations in santosa only or out the island as well, it is great to take it to see the view from the top as you can visit the highest peak in Singapore personally I would rather I used the time to visit other places but if you have the time its good to go."
"Nice maintained canle cars, paid S$ 33 pp, for mt faber - sentosa vv and inner cable car trip on sentosa. Prices are not cheap ar all, but viewsare stunning. On every boarding station there was a small queue, staff members let all people riding together board together, without any problem. However When boarding at Sentosa back to the mainlaind, the rude female staff member without asking urged us to join a family in a car. I refused. In a rude tone she said ""must wait"" this was also the case of the couple behind us. The an empty car came acrosse and she pushe me with her hands on my shoulder ""board now"" please give this staff member a hospitality course, i paid 33 (x2) not te be treated rudely and disrespectful manner! She is a disgrace for this expensive day trip."
"Amazing Views and Great Cabins, unfortunately they shut down with bad whether (which is fine) but isn't great when you by an all day pass and unfortunately don't even use the pass due to it being shut down. Only pay for what you know you will use baring in mind the whether as well. Definitely worth one trip though."
"Took a taxi to the hilltop and purchased tickets for a round trip. It was a public holiday so the ticketing took a while (we are not big fans of lines). The process could be made easier and more efficient with kiosks. The ride itself is great with fantastic overviews of Singapore, albeit a bit short. We did not go to Senosa but that looked from above to be a great family type excursion/waterpark."
"We bought a sky pass and had a 40% off from the McDonald's Monopoly coupon. It was an average experience and we feel it's a one time thing or it gets too boring (but we shouldn't expect too much because what more can cable cars do, right?)One downside we had was that although we were told last boarding was at 9:30pm, the shutters were already down at 9:20pm, which was really upsetting as we rushed from Universal Studios to the Merlion station hoping to catch the last boarding time - which we unfortunately did not as it was closed earlier than the stated timing. Nonetheless, we're thankful that there was a monorail station across the cable car station.Wouldn't have bought tickets if we didn't have the 40% off as we feel that the tickets are a little overpriced before the discount. Like I mentioned earlier, it's just a one time thing."
Paid for the 3 part journey only to find that the middle part was closed thus lsing the chance for the location attractions
"When you can't go around a building, go through it. Singapore cable car cuts through a commercial building between faber peak and sentosa island. Nice views, but other than that, you're average cable car. But recommended way to get to and from sentosa."
"We covered the Singapore Cable Car during our stay at the Sentosa Island, good decent car but owing to the smaller size of the car, one would not get an interrupted view of the surrounding, one will either have window safety grills or car frame itself in between the view and you. If one has covered the Singapore Flyer, then cable car is nothing compared to it. view was good, one side of the vast open sea and the other side city line with all the sky scrappers. We got a car to our family (without any sharing) so it was fun."
"A great birdseye view of Singapore and Sentosa Island. Those who are not so keen on heights, the cable cars fly high above the land and sea below, but the cars are fully enclosed and move gently. It is worthwhile getting the combination ticket for S$28 (adult) which includes the Mount Faber line (it gets you to Sentosa) and the Sentosa line."
"It is really expensive taking the cable car just to enter Sentosa. No doubt it offers a nice view of Singapore and sentosa island, but the price is just not justifiable. Just walk in to Sentosa using the broadwalk from Vivo, its much more enjoyable!"
It has a long que but you can access to visit harbor town and sentosa island. You may collect ticket by paying at counter for 10 $
"Took the trip from Harbourtown. About 10min walk from mall to the actual cable car station. Great view of Sentosa and Singapore Harbour. Limited value when actually on Sentosa. Trip up to Faber was unfortunately too late in the day to explore, but you'd need to really get around up there to see full value for the price of the tickets."
Expensive by Singapore standards when you can get here by metro and walk across for free. Such a short ride for limited views of city and Sentosa. Oddity is having to go up/down to catch the cable car from street level. It's not very well linked with the metro or mall. Very few people carry on to Mount Faber.
"Interesting, one can see Harbour Front and Sentosa area from different angle. Certain things only can be seen from high above.Too bad, I took the ride around late morning or noon. Inside the Cable Car was super hot, felt like in an oven. There is little fan which doesn't really help in hot humid weather of Singapore, especially during summer. That is an area where management could do something to improve it."
It is worth riding the cable car over to Sentosa Island for great photos but beware that it is quite pricey.
We had a go on the cable car from Sentosa lookout to Harbour town it was pretty average and didn't have the wow factor of other cable cars from around the world but if you have never been on one it would make an iconic part of your Singapore trip
"I loved the experience, the views and how it gets you into Sentosa Island but the cost of the ride isn't really worth it.Pros:the views of Singaporeyou get a cart to yourself (doesnt matter your group size. we were able to fit 7 inside one cart)a great alternative way of getting to Sentosa IslandCons:the cost/price (the prices was confusing so we ended up paying more than we thought)Not great if you are afraid of heightsOnly lasts 15 - 20 mins."
"Me and my friend traveled over to Santosa Island by cable car. We bought a package with unlimited travels, and two extra activities on Santosa.We got a nice view over some parts of Singapore and the Santosa Island. The cable cars felt very safe and modern.We think it was an okay price, and we went by the cable cars back and forth just because we could."
Same as any other cable car ever ridden but extremely pricey. At $28pp fo a one way ride off the island (told we can come back on) this was way too expensive for what it was. Cheaper ways in and off Sentosa with views that can be obtained for much less money.
Sentosa and the harbour are so built up that the trip has changed a lot but it is a wonderful smooth ride and a fantastic view.
"Kids insist on take the cable car. It got the spectacular view of the sea and santosa island, but not worth the money."
We bring foreign guests here so we take the cable car 3 or 4 times a year. There have been a few price changes recently and it's now about $120 for 4 adults. This makes it just too expensive for what it is.
The views are very good from the trip to Sentosa and it's a lot less crowded than the Sentosa Express. The advantage of the express is that it's only $4 but I think that the cable car is worth doing once if you're doing a day trip to Sentosa.
"I was recommended to visit Sentosa, and realised the cabel car was the only option to visit both mount peak and the island.@S$33 it is not cheap, but worthwhile for one off visitor like me. You will get birdviews of nearly the whole city/country and appreciate it more. Is it fantastic? No, but it's quite interesting, especially when you fly over the resorts."
"wish it was longer, kids will love it...good experience over all.the photo op is quite abrupt, can be done well"
"Used the Cable Car to get to Sentosa/Universal Studios. Great views. Only issue is at the end of the day, at dark, it too a long time for staff to find us a taxi to take us back to our hotel"
"The cable car ride is a highlight of a Singapore visit but timing is everything! When the tour buses arrived the queue at Mt Faber snaked out of the building, down the stairs and across the back of the car park (so my wife and I walked down the ""mountain"" to the middle station). Nice walk though."
"It's worth travelling once on the Singapore Cable Car to Sentosa for the lovely views. However, I do find the ticket prices rather overpriced for a relatively short journey from Harbourfront station to Sentosa that only takes a few minutes. It costs 33S$ for a return journey or 43S$ for unlimited rides all day. If you get the unlimited ticket, I recommend riding up to Mount Faber as well for a stunning view of Harbourfront and Sentosa. Be careful during the weekends as the queues for the cable car can get super long. It's probably better to travel to Sentosa first in the morning, then head to Mount Faber in the afternoon to avoid the queues.I would also recommend travelling on the cable car only when it is a clear day as the rain would obstruct a great deal of your view. If it is raining during your travels, then the Sentosa Express is another speedy option priced at only 4S$ for a return journey.The unlimited ticket option allows you to redeem a free souvenir magnet from the Singapore Cable Car gift shop, but make sure when you hand over your ticket stub to the staff that you get it back after redeeming your complimentary gift. The gift shop staff took away my ticket stub and I didn't think much of it at the time since I had the blue wristband on me that they give you as well at the Harbourfront ticket office. However, later on when I wanted to get on the cable car at Siloso station, the person checking the tickets said you need to show the ticket stub in addition to the blue wristband. I had to go all the way back to the gift shop and ask for the ticket stub that the staff member had forgotten to give back to me. Do keep your ticket stub with you at all times! :)"
"The Singapore Cable car is one of those things it is worth doing once, but I would suggest finding an alternative way back. It is very high in places and is actually quite a short trip across to the island where you can switch to another cable car at an additional cost, which is actually quite high to begin with, in fact you can get a low cost airline ticket for less!!! - and travel a lot further, it is certainly not the most cost effective form of transport. Only do it on a clear day."
I was very underwhelmed with the whole experience. The cable car goes over it two stages where you can split your journey if you like. It goes over a bit of the harbour and a cruise liner which there is always one there.On the way back we got off at the half way point and went shopping at the new huge mall - it really is worth a visit - although having all the top end of fashion outlets - there are heaps of other good shops which do not demand top dollar.
Rode the Cable car from Marina Bay to Silosa Beach and back.Saw the Green jungles and Skyscrapers simultaneously on one side and the Sea with ships on the other side.
this is soecially for sentosa where you should visit in the morning itself and do not opt for those half day sentosa tours with one way cable ridethere is lot to explore in sentosa
A tourist must try... But it will be almost like going on the cable car in Hong Kong. Just that the view in Hong Kong is much more majestic compared to the ones here in Singapore. The Singapore Flyer would be a much better choice!
"Good view from the cable car - definitely worth one time visit. however the ticket is for all the lines, you cant have ticket for one line. so you end up using it for all lines and going to places you would not have visited."
"The view is great, but the price was not that great.there wasnt really much clarification about what you were buying ticket wise, i asked for a one way ticket but still ended up with a return"
Overall rate is just 3 over 5. They are quit expensive for foreigner (SGD29 per person as we choose from Mount Faber to Sentosa only). The only way to reach to Mount Faber we need to take a taxi and its very hot inside cable car as the fan is not function at all. But we do enjoy the view and its the alternative way to enter Sentosa.
Its an expensive way to travel over to Sentosa but its fun to do once if you have children. I wouldnt mind the fee so much if the staff could manage to offer a smile whilst barking commands at the custmers
$$ spent not worth the distance of the trip.. the view was similar to singapore flyer and marina skypark. Might as well go to sentosa peak and see...
"This was a fun ride, but bit short (10 min per way).Excellent way to see views of Sentosa Island.We went early in the morning. It was not crowded."
"Some nice views over Singapore which negate the use of other Non Free High 'Rides' here while it is expensive for the amount of time you are on it.Unlike a number of other countries you have to be a Singaporean Senior 'Resident' to qualify for the Seniors Discount, while a number of other countries offer a Discounted Ticket for a Non Resident Senior (Tourist) on all their attractions."
General view of singapore can be observed from the cable car. visited sentosha through one way. kids may enjoy
"Give you a good view on your way to Santosa Island. Worth it for a experience but if you are on a budget will take to monorail instead.while it was a good experience, have had better in Hongkong on the Ngong Ping 360 cable car"
"This is just like any other cable car you see .The only advantage is that it is a really quick way to go to Sentosa from Mount Faber . But this is also costly .If travelled in Cable car before , use MRT to go to sentosa"
We visited sentosa on 3rd March.. We took cable car from vivo city mall station to sentosa.. I didnot find it too good for 29sgd per pax.. Instead I will recommend sky & luge... It was awesome ride of sentosa imbiah station.if you want to live the beauty of sentosa.. Skyride is must.. Even Singapore flyer is also a best option to view the city... Cable car is over rated.. In my opinion... Thanks..
"We took the cable car over to Sentosa for dinner and back again when some visitors were in town. We were looking forward to the views, however we were very shocked at the price. We did not think it was worth it."
"It is OK if you finished all what you want to do in Singapore and still have time to spent on the island but do not want to do anything with activity, not so great."
We did the cable car thing and have say most disappointing. There is little to see apart from some of the wonderful old houses buried amongst the forrest.Bordered on being a waste of both time and money.
The Singapore Cable car has been upgraded since we last visited.The cable car runs form Sentosa island to Harbourfront terminal and then on to Mt. Faber.The cable car is very expensive to ride - there are no one way fares and the fare for a return trip is $SG26 each - no discount.As a result most people now take the monorail from the new Harbourfront terminal (some 150m away) - the cost is $SG 4 each way. The new harbourfront terminal is at the entrance to Harbourfront metro station.At the Mt Faber terminal ther is no public transport form the top to the bottom - no bus service etc - so you either walk down the hill or catch the cable car back to Harbourfront. At Mt. Faber there is only an expensive restaurant - even the lookout is now closed and can not be accessed.As a result the most popular route to access Sentosa Island is now the monorail.However the view across the bay to Singapore is spectacular to say the least - but comes at a price
"I recommend Cable car only if you want to see the view of Harbour Port. There Cable Car rides one from Harbour Port to till sentosa isalnd and second is within sentosa island. from First carble car line (harbour point) also known as old line, you can see Port and sew with big ships and few part of sentosa island (resorts, water park). From other line (also know as new line) you can see almost all attraction points (all Beach, Tiger tower, Parajump etc ). You need to buy tickets both each cable car (together / separately/ one line). I suggest buy tickets online from local dealers."
You get a great view from the cable car BUT it's quite expensive and over in the blink of an eye! I'd say not really worth it.
"The best thing I remember about my experience riding cable car was spending a good time with my family/relatives in Singapore. It was more about who I was with, but the attraction itself was not that memorable. Sure, it was a quite nice experience to see how small Singapore is from above. It gave us a glimpse about this tiny country, the harbor, Sentosa Island, etc. But with the price we paid, it is something passable and better save my money somewhere else more breathtaking and memorable"
"We found the cablecar rides to be very expensive, even when coupled in an attraction package. We were also put off because the staff assured us that the cablecars would run until 1:00am on New Year's Eve, but they closed them down early and we had to walk across the bridge instead. The views are fantastic, but the ride is short. I would recommend riding the cable cars back and forth a few times for the view alone so you feel you get your money's worth out of the ticket."
"I think this is one of the most overpriced attractions in Singapore. You can visit mush better attractions for Free. Like The Gardens By the Bay, Botanic Gardens."
"THe cable car trip to Sentosa island is generally offered as a complex option of packages with various multi-ride and or entry to various attraction on Sentosa. The views are great, however in our case somewhat subdued by weather. It isn't cheap and I understand that at peak times there can be queues. We we there in early JAnuary so the queues were very short. There are extensions over the length of the island which have lovely views over the beaches and rainforest."
The tickets are sold as return not single.....good job we wanted to go one way back to mainland which was great but at mnainland we waited 30 mins for taxi in the end went back and caught taxi from shopping mall at harbour stop but even then took another one hour but it was xmas!!
Short trip for value. Kids was a little bit scary!but u get a fabulous view. It should have the opportunity to buy just one way.But it probably the best way to arrive to the island
There was four of us that went there in a taxi up the winding hill to the venue. It was $30 per adult to get to Sentosa Island via the cable car. There is good ventilation in the cable car and lights for at night.You can see a great span of the city and also the Sentosa Island. You go through one of the buildings as well.
"A nice way to discover Singapore ""from the sky"", but I personally felt that it was a short ride for almost 30$. Although it's probably not a surprise since everything here is expensive."
"The cable Car ride is probably the most over rated attractions in Singapore. At 28 SGD for the ride, its the most expensive way to get to Sentosa. The view is good and the ride is nice but also very quick! The costs for the ride are extremely high according to me. Overall go for it as a tourist if you really like to blow money !"
This cable car is the most expensive way to get into Sentosa. (SGD29) If you have never been in a cable car you can try this once. You can get the ride for a discount if you are buying Sentosa attractions pass. Alternately look for discounts offered by showing boarding pass of some airlines. View from the ride is beautiful but it is very short. If you are combining Malaysia and Singapore visit try cable car at Genting Highlands for breathtaking views for approx 2SGD
If you already taken cable ride during your trip to Signapore-Malaysia-Thailand then you may skip this. This is gives you good aerial views.
A bit worry because I had a bit problem with higher but still fun to try. Sentosa island have many interesting things to visited
"The view will always be breathtaking, but it's not that cheap :p The normal tickets cost $29, we got ours at $18 from Sea Wheel Travel Pte Ltd at People's Park Center. The ticket is valid for a two way Singapore line (Faber - HarbourFront- Sentosa) and two way Sentosa line (the cable car line within Sentosa)MRT HarbourFront, then follow the signs within VivoCity"
"Whilst on holiday, we decided to spend a day on Sentosa Island, south of Singapore City. We took the MRT tube to Harbour Front station and purchased tickets for travel on the cable car. It is only possible to buy return journey tickets - no one-way tickets are available. Cost in October 2015 - S$28 per person.We boarded the cabin at the shopping mall and travelled across above the water to Sentosa island. After walking around the attractions and shops in central Sentosa resort, we then used the cable car to go to the beach area from Sentosa to Silosa and return. It is possible to leave the car at Mount Imbiah station to check the views from the observation area.We then took the cable car back to the mainland and stayed on it until reaching Mount Haber, where there is a restaurant, shop and bar / bistro. The journey from Mt Haber to Harbour Front was included to finalise our journey and return to the start point. All of these trips are included in the price. There are great views to be had on a clear day, but when we travelled, Singapore was affected by heavy haze and the views were very restricted."
I wishes It will be long ride and massive high up like Nongping in Hong Kong. It was little too short to ride on. The views was enjoyable.
Part of Singapores history - it is only a short ride though. Better to go at night and see the night lights of Singapore and Sentosa
"My girlfriend and I bought a package for unlimited cable car day passes plus two attractions on Sentosa Island (we chose the Merlion and trapezing, but there are other options) for $50 each.The cable car round trip is already $30, so this turned out to be a great deal!The cable cars themselves are a mediocre experience, and didn't strike me as particularly unique. Mount Faber is not worth the cost if you are treating the cable cars as an experience on their own. It simply leads to a gift shop without much of a view.If you are looking to do a full or half day at Sentosa Island, they're convenient for getting around. If you don't mind the heat and walking, skip out on the cable cars!"
"I'm glad I did the Cable Car, its a great facility, I felt safe, there weren't any queue's, all in all a seamless experience.My only criticism is that you have no option but to purchase a return ticket. We caught the car from Vivo Shopping Centre and would have been quite happy to purchase a leg to Sentosa Island, however the tickets are priced or inclusive of a return journey back to Mt. Faber and then back to Vivo Shopping Centre.We ended up dropping the return component, the heat and activities wore us down and in all honesty, it was too much effort to return to the Cable Car Station with the nearby Monorail calling us instead.. I can't fault the experience however, just not enough of a wow factor for me to journey all the way back to the return point after traversing around Sentosa Island."
"Great view but $65 for one adult and two kids aged four and six was a bit expensive in my opinion.Went on a weekday so no queues,"
"The views were great, the ride smooth, and the staff friendly. My problem was that when we took the cable car from Sentosa back to Faber Peak, it was about 5PM or so. We were waiting about 15 minutes for a taxi. The attendant said she would call for a taxi. Another 10 minutes and no luck. However, there were many personal cars and busy taxis driving by. Finally another attendant recommended we take the cable car towards Harbourfront. Then from there, get a taxi. It would've been nice if we got this heads up earlier.So the attendant explains to the other attendants our situation (there were 4 other families waiting with us). We finally arrive at Harbourfront. We however needed to walk a little bit to make it to the taxis. Once we made it to the taxis, we needed to wait over an hour. There was a line queued, so we lined up as well.Once again, I'd give the cable cars a 5 digit, but the fact that they never gave us a warning really bothered me."
"It is a good experience and but not an awesome ride. you get to view the different angle of Santosa island.The ticket is expensive though , but can be compensated with the nice view once you are up there. You can get off at different place which was a plus point."
nothing special but worth it..it takes you from the mountains to the universal studios park where you can spend the day. nice sights.
"Interesting view and experience. The feeling u get when the cable car leave the building and fly through the sky in a glass cabin accompanied by the wind. However, night ride is more recommended and avoid afternoon rides."
This is a ok way to get one place to another If you have not done it do it. There is nothing wrong will this ride but it is only average way of spending a couple hour of your day.
My wife and I went to Sentosa and enjoyed our time there and we wanted to return on the Cable Car and were surprised that price was for two way only. We think people should be able to pay a cheaper price for a one way trip.The view was okay but we got a better view of Singapore from the Observation Deck on top of Marina Bay Sands.
"The cable car in Singapore runs from Sentosa to Mount Faber. It provides nice views of Sentosa and HarbourFront and the wider port area. It could not be described as exciting though. I thought it was expensive for such a short trip but worth doing once, but not something which I would pay to do again. Best time to go would be around sunset for the views."
This is taken to reach Santsoa Island and it is a good experience and not an asewome one. But you will have a good view of the whole Santosa island before landing there and that's the best part.
"The motivation behind the link auto ride is with the goal that you can see the perspectives of Singapore and Sentosa Island. Be that as it may, its really pricey about $25 for a grown-up ticket. It goes really speedy and actually, I didn't think it was justified regardless of the cost however, by and by. Verify you go on a sunny morning too, shady day and you essentially squandered your cash."
The actual chair lift is quite fun but it is the short walk up to the look-out that make the trip worth while.I do think this is over-priced however.Avoid the tourist trap as you get off the cable car - the food is also no good and over-priced.
"First things first:There are two stations in Singapore from where you can get onto this cable car, one at Faber Peak and another at Harbor Front station (Vivo city mall). I took it from Harbor Front station.I took it on a weekday and there was no queue for tickets. You can checkout combo tickets if you are visiting other attractions at Sentosa. Ticket is expensive IMHO. You will get a return ticket only. I am not sure if they have one side ride tickets.Now, if this is a your first cable car ride, you sure gonna enjoy this. Though the ride is quite short, but the view of the ocean below will surely lure you into photography. You also see an overview of whole Sentosa island, and its various attractions.If you have been to cable cars before, then there is nothing special for you here. In my opinion, you can very well skip it.What is the fuss about superheroes, I did not understand. They provided few masks and badges with tickets, you need to download some app on your mobile, I did not know what that is all about and it did not attract me do go into all that downloading etc."
I haven't found that great...u can just find a view of harbour...for the people who are not having any experience of cable car before may find this exciting..
"Singapore cable car is just another cable car, nothing new about it. Only difference I found is it passes over a busy city. So if you have been to some good cable car ride in Swtzerland or some other place around, it's not worth spending money."
"Sentosa is not worth a visit. The view of the harbour and of part of the city from the cable is very good, but the ticket price too expensive."
"Great aerial view of the river - very slow and bumpy ride - having experienced the cable car in Cape Town, South Africa, this one is unfortunately a bit average."
Enjoyed the cable car ride and views from Mount Faber of Singapore. The ride took us to Sentosa. We had to use the free bus service to get around Sentosa Island. Cable car ride was nothing special - not very high or long but worth a ride. My only comment would be that the price was high for a relatively short ride.
"Faber Cable cars take you from Faber Park to the sentosa waterfront mall (aka VivoCity) and ends at Sentosa Island. Its a great way to see the waterfront and the attractions at Sentosa (Universal, Waterparks etc.) .The developer however tries too hard to make the ride the attraction offering vip cars, dining cars, and fly like superhero cars for this 15 minute ride from point a to point b. Its an enjoyable activity and a good price for the trip. Be aware that returning from Mt. Faber is at the end of a road. You will need to use your phone to secure a taxi, and there is no real convenient MRT (subway) stop."
I had an average experience because the cable car goes too slow that you might spend half of your day in a cable car rather than going to your preferred destination and enjoying like:Universal Studios SingaporeAdventure Cove Waterpark
"After doing a couple of really good cable car rides in Vietnam we expected a lot from this cabe car ride in Singapore. Whilst we enjoyed ourselves for the short rides to Sentosa and Mount Faber it really isn't worth a trip just on itself.It would be good to combine with a visit to Sentosa.Also at Mount Faber they are missing a trick, they should have a viewing platform of the city with picture opportunities for tourists who visit. All they need to do is allow a viewing platform on the roof and it would be amazing."
You climb a building up a lift and pay for the ride . Yes it's d c app ready but not as it looks on the advert . Kids would be disappointed . We got the cable back to the hill top and it's not well served by taxis and we were told by a taxi driver this is common .
"We were surprised by the price of the cable car, and were disappointed that it was so short. You can easily walk up to the mount Faber, likewise you can walk to Sentosa or take the little tram connection. So if you are on a budget: skip the cable car.Spectacular though when you go over the cruise ships when coming from harbourfront, going to Sentosa"
We were alone in the car which was good and the trip over was great with splendid views over Sentosa Island.We were able to see that the island would be great for families as the main attractions are water slide themed.We did not get off as we were caught in a sudden squall and the car was swinging badly.We were happy to sit still and get back as soon as possible.It was an expensive scare at Â£15 each!
"The queue to buy tickets is a nightmare the cable car is very good, the cars are spotless and the views are great. However the system for purchasing tickets is very un Singaporean, people pushing in, the system is not policed and only two people selling tickets.What a Shame."
"Singapore Cable Car offers a stunning 180-degree view of the Southern part of Singapore west coast precinct with its apparent enclosure. Provides an aerial link from Mount Faber (Faber Peak Singapore) on the main island of Singapore to the resort island of Sentosa across the Harbour. Selected as a premium gateway, Singapore Cable Car offers a premium and differentiated experience for visitors to Sentosa island's attractions. The cable car system is another world's first with its glass-bottomed cabins If you're heading to Sentosa or Mt Faber you may wish to travel by the cable car, and enjoy the views...one set back is the ride is overpriced."
A bit over priced and short as quick as 3-4 minutes. The view is nice but in short it's not worth the money.
This was my 1st time trying/riding a cable car and it was just an alright experience for me. I thought the ride would have been a little slower to give you time to take in all the scenic views but I guess I was wrong since this went very quickly. I was a bit disappointed because of that but staff here are really helpful so service is good.
"We used the cable car as access to Sentosa Island, and for that it is a good option, but as a stand alone attraction, I am not too sure. At S$29.00 per adult, it's not exactly cheap for what amounts to about a 15 minute ride. We did get a 10% discount for mentioning that we flew with Jetstar though. Just show your boarding pass. Boarding as we did at Harbour Front, we first travelled up to Mount Faber, where we had only enough time to take in the views from the lookout (go through the gift shop), before re-embarking on our trip across to Sentosa Island. At the Sentosa Island juncture, you can opt to look through the cable car museum which is included in your ticket price. We didn't this time, but did several years ago. It was a worthy attraction, but not a must see. The round trip later saw us delivered safely but otherwise unenthused back at Harbour Front. Take note that the car are not air conditioned, with only a small fan trying mostly unsuccessfully to circulate a little bit of air within the cabin."
"We travelled on the cable car in the evening to see a show. On buying a ticket we asked to pay for a one way ticket as the show didnt finished until after the cable car closed for the evening so how on earth are we supposed to complete our rerurn travel on there. Come on Guys surely there should be one way price if you are not open after a show being held (wings of time show 8.40 - 9.40) last cable car 9.30.Other than that the ride was really nice and would have loved to use the other half of our ticket to visit Sentosa on another day (That would have meant travelling there twice maybe buying lunch and drinks and putting more money into their economy, shortsighted on their behalf ! )"
"Nice with the view and everything, but way too pricey. And no one-way option; so the ticket include roundtrip."
nice way to go from A to B.. the view is not something that is a ''must''.. use this to look at sentosa from above . i would skip it and try for something else to spend my money
"We were staying on Sentosa & took the cable car to Mt Faber & back. It was a clear day & the views were lovely.I was expecting more at Mt Faber. When you arrive you can either go to the gift shop. or visit the cafe.I had not checked, but thought there would at least be a park or gardens. So we had a coffee & headed back to Sentosa somewhat disappointed."
Overpriced and doesn't add to the Sentosa experience. Try coming in via MRT/Sentosa Express or the Boardwalk. Save your money for attractions on Sentosa
"A cable car ride is a cable car ride. We went at dusk and a nice view, but it wasn't worth the price. On the return, it was quite dark, and the other cable cars looked like flashing lightning bugs. The Super Hero theme wasn't of interest to the teenagers."
For me evrey one told us to ride it at the night ... i think in the morning will be better because the only thing u will see is the light of the buldings ..which is far away frome the cable car
I was a bit disappointed at the distance the cable car traveled. Once we reached one of the Stations we had no idea where to go or what to look at. I was looking forward to this experience but it has nothing on Skyrail in Cairns Australia
While in Singapore for our mothers 70th birthday we went over to Sentosa and on the way back caught the cable car. The cable car gives a different view of Singapore but we were lucky to have a clear day. Its the sort of thing that there is no point doing if its pouring down or smoggy. Chairs are comfy and each car held up to 12 people. There was no que which was a added bonus.It was another different perspective to Singapore. This attraction isn't very friendly if you are in a wheelchair or if you have mobility issues.
"Me and my husband rode the cable car from harbour front to sentosa, and back from sentosa to harbour front. It cost us 29 SGD per person just to ride the cable car for 10 minutes. The price is too expensive, but it's worth for once in a lifetime experience."
We took a taxi to the Jewel Box on Mt Faber Road. Mt Faber is 106m the highest hill on Singapore. We took a one way cable car ride to Sentosa from the mainland as an alternative to the train. I was amazed that the cablecar went right though a building. This attraction was free for us as we booked a Sinagpore Stopover Transfer package. We had a great view of half of Sentosa Island as well as a view across to the city. We went back to the mainland by the boardwalk to the mall.
"We enjoyed the views, but thought a round trip ticket for 30 SD was way too expensive. We didn't realize we could take the monorail but wish we would have after the experience. My advice, skip this expensive attraction, take the monorail to the island, and instead go to the top of a hotel to get the Singapore view (think Marina Bay Sands)."
"We done the return cable car ride to Sentosa from the mainland as an alternative to the train, and was glad we done this. A bit expensive for such a short ride, but it did give a great view of half of Sentosa as well as a view across to the city- although most of the city was blocked by hills. Enjoyed it as a first time visitor to Singapore, but would not do it a 2nd time....."
Catching the cable car to Sentosa island was a fun way of getting to the island as you got a nice view of the island and all the attractions. We bought return tickets but in the end caught a cab from Sentosa back to the main land because it was just as fast if not quicker. I would recommend buying a one way ticket and then catching a cab back at the end of the day.
"We felt that this was over priced for what it was. The views of Singapore were not great. Cars NOT air-conditioned, the fans weren't great."
we did it as why not but its $30 to ride both ways on the one day and we didnt realise so we paid $30 each for a 10 minute ride
All very efficient and quite reasonably priced but even though Inusually have no issues with heights it was rainy and windy and most definitely I was pleased to get off!!!
"I guess if you're in Singapore and oblivious to all the money you're spending on vacation, add this one to the list. it's not that this cable car ride is bad - it's not, it's very good, as is everything somehow connected to Sentosa. The problem is that it's very expensive - about US$25 a head, and it only lasts about ten to 15 minutes. If you've been on cable car rides in other Asia locations, like Hong Kong, you'll get a better bang for buck, and see much, more more. I would not say this is a must see; that said, I imagine kids will find it fascinating, and if you've got money to burn, burn it on this, too."
There is nothing special in this ride though they are claiming that they are the first cable car provider with Justice League design in their cable cars. From Harbor we went to Sentosa and the cable car that brought us to Sentosa has no any mark of Justice League. Quite funny.
i'm afraid of heights but took the courage to try this... before finally going home..we decided to stay atleast 2 nights in singapore and this was the best advice everyone is telling me to try and make my trip memorable one hahahaha...i dont want to post pics since my nervousness is surely clear in all the shots...
"Nothing really special about the cable car ride to and fro Sentosa island, It is just another option to reach Sentosa Island. You can enjoy the view and get to ride as much as you like if you buy travel package at Sentosa Island, which in my case brought me to Faber Mountain Cable car station which I found to be a small hilly nature wonder worth to explore if you love to be surround by trees and bushes.It's an old attraction that did not give me a thrills as other cable car in this part of the world."
"I took this ride first in 2003. The cars at that time were small (could sit 4 persons) but they had a glass bottom. I think that was their USP. This time in May-2014 when I took the ride again, the car was specious (6-8 persons can sit) BUT the bottom glass was missing! It takes the fun out of the ride, to be frank! Anyways, the view below is very good.My suggestion is that while going to Sentosa from main land, get-in at Tower 2 on HarbourFront. Then while returning from Sentosa go all the way till Faber Peak. Enjoy the walk there and then again get-in and finally alight at Tower 2.Also, if you are planning two trips to Sentosa - one for Universal Studios and other for the other attractions on Sentosa like the Luge, Dolphin Lagoon etc. then have the Cable Car ride once and have the Sentosa Express on second day. Now, the EZLink card is accepted for Sentosa Express as well."
Its a rather short trip if u only want to go to sentosa from harbourfront. But its has beautiful view n they over different kind of package trip by ticket booth.
After experiencing the cable car ride in Lantau Hong Kong this came off second best. We took the whole round trip getting off for a short time to check out Sentosa Island. Apart from some harbour views in the Sentosa section we mostly passed over construction sites so was not inspiring.
"It cost $26 Singapore Dollars to ride the Cable Car from the nearby Cruise Terminal to an island (Santosa) with hotels and attractions for children and adults at an added cost. I did not find anything on the island that was free. So if the attractions for an added cost or the view do not have value, skip this ride."
"The Singapore Cable Car first opened in 1974 and acts as a form of aerial transportation between Sentosa and Mount Faber across the Keppel Harbour. It is one of the main tourist attractions on Sentosa, with over 80 pods carrying up to 8 passengers each.I usually get a taxi or the cheap and efficient MRT when I want to go to Sentosa (there are fantastic dining outlets at Sentosa) although for a change I thought why don't I make the journey on the famous cable car. I do have a fear of heights, but I was prepared to risk my life on this occasion! It is not as steep as the epic Langkawi Cable Car in Malaysia, nor the ropeway at Table Mountain in Cape Town, but it is still very high above the harbour giving amazing panoramic views of the area. From the Jewel Box at Mount Faber (which has a great cafÃ©, by the way), I headed down to Sentosa: Singapore's playground!I can remember paying S$29 for my adult one way ticket. I cannot remember how much the return fare was, but I only wanted to do one journey anyway (I don't think my vertigo could have taken much more!). The queue for the cable car once you have purchased your ticket is always very busy, and I stood there for a long time waiting for a pod to become available. It must have taken a good half hour from when I bought my ticket to when I entered the actual pod and got moving. Anyhow, there were amazing views as we immediately pulled out of the station. The Singapore Cable Car is not really a long ride ' it only lasts around 10 minutes in the air ' but as with all things in Singapore there was a great ambience to the whole thing and you could see that families and young children were enjoying the spectacular setting. I had an Indian family in my pod with me, which made taking videos quite difficult but I made sure I had a lot of photos of my experience!At the beginning and end of your journey there are opportunities to buy various merchandise and souvenirs, but to be honest it all looked a bit tacky to me (stuff like 'I Love SG' T-shirts), so I just walked through the gift shops and out into what was Imbiah Lookout on Sentosa, quite near the Tiger Sky Tower. It would be interesting to compare the views from the Cable Car and the Sky Tower, and maybe I will get a chance to do so soon!But if you are heading for the Singapore Cable Car, bear in mind the hefty price, and ask yourself if it would be more economical to take a taxi to Sentosa instead (or even cheaper, the MRT). The views are amazing from the Cable Car ride, but you can get aerial views of Singapore for less $$$ elsewhere."
Nothing much to do in the cable car. Goes up-to the hill and back. The views are excellent in the evening when you can see the sunset from the car. Good views of Singapore from the car.
"Once in the cable cable, take a quick look around you to enjoy the view of singapore city, sentosa island, the port, ships, sea. (What else?)Felt like it took less than 10 minutes. Nice to try it once, but probably will use the train or bus the next time (to sentosa island)."
"The Singapore Cable Car offers a nice view of the city and the Sentosa area, but it's a quick ride, and your ticket is only good for one round-trip transfer. I was able to get a discounted ticket with a bank card promo, which made me feel better. But I would've been more disappointment had I paid full price for the ticket.If you're visiting Singapore for holiday and are looking to visiting Mount Faber Park and Sentosa, then I'd say it's a nice way to connect to those places. If you're traveling with children, then I think they'll enjoy the bird's eye view of Sentosa.The cable car is one of those things you do just to say you did it - not something that you would do more than once."
"Singapore is really a glamorous city, highly expensive and excellently planned. it was a business tour for 4 days. I had to be on wheels but tried best to gallop as much as I could with eyes. every place of attraction was expensive. I tried the cable car for the first time in my life and I believe it was never a wastage. Marina bay, Sentosa Island are best for kids or fun lovers as there are so many amusements. I loved to visit the Sentosa fort where the memories from WWII was treasured so nicely. I hate to go to Mustafa it is nothing but a crowd but may the people who must buy something for family on return may visit and it is the only shopping place open 24hours. most of the Bangladeshis were around it, like Little Bangla."
"Depending of what your expectations are, we were a little disappointed. It was $26 for each person and the experience was not that worth while compared to the Marina Bay sky park. We did not feel the need to get off at any of the stops. Compared to other flyers in the world it was just ok for us!"
"I got lucky as was able to time the ride just perfectly to catch the sunset. The views were spectacular, and the photographs, had I been able to take any, would have been stunning. There in lies my one complaint. I understand that safety is critical, but having even a small opening in the Plexiglas cover that would allow for a clear, non-glass reflective, photo would have been wonderful. As it was, all of the pictures are in my mind. Next time I may investigate the dining option in the car."
"I just had the full afternoon in Singapore so we spent time at Sentosa and took the cable car. I skimmed the island a bit overland. But we had to pay SD$26.00 each.The weather in Singapore, when I visited, by the way was crazy. It was searing hot when I arrived just before lunch time. My friend and I were in Sentosa in the afternoon when it begun to drizzle. By the time were in one of the cable cars, it was raining hard. It was thrilling, to say the least. It was fun, as well. So unfortunate, I had such a short stay."
The cable car from Harbourbay up to Mount Faber is reletively short (only couple of minutes) and maily shows parts of the harbour. You can't see any of the Singapore skyline from here. The open sea is to far away for a good look. All and all a little dissappointing.
Was a good view but sgd222 for a one way trip for 10 minutes was way over the top. would not recommend. better to do the singapore flyer
"Nice view of the harbour and Sentosa Island but expensive - as many things are in Singapore anyway - compared to the monorail option. Pretty short ride too. Forget the ""Adventure"" package. Its a lot more expensive but combines the cable car ride with several attractions on Sentosa. The Sea aquarium is a must see but others (Merlion) not so much. While the Segway and Luge rides are also good, the line ups are long and your high-end-can't-live-with- out ""Adventure"" ticket only provides one round for each while most other riders opt for a ticket to go three times. The Chill Out drink at the end is nothing exotic like depicted - just bottled water or a pop. Ripoff."
"This had been 'bigged-up' to us and in truth the scale and scope of the project is huge and the views undoubtedly great. But, on arrival at Mt Faber from Tower 2, there is the usual tacky gift stuff, a closed restaurant and no little bar to sit and drink in the view. Take the journey on to Senosa and all that is there is a theme park and some tacky exhibitions. This was the most disappointing part of our Singapore experience. Do it for the thrill of a cable car experience, but don't expect more."
"This cable car ride was...average. It was OK, but basically the same as any other cable car ride. It did give a good view of the skyline but the line to get on was fairly long. Sentosa Island is interesting but nothing out of the ordinary like I expected. Guess I was hoping Singapore's attractions would be more ""Asian"" and not so Americanized or modern."
"Pretty expensive, sgd 26 one way, but once in a while, this cable cable was not fully air cond and a bit warm in the cable car for 4 of us , two adult and two children below 12."
"First the good bits:This cable car runs from Mount Faber Park via Harbourfront to Sentosa.At Mount Faber there is a good restaurant (The Jewel Box) with lovely staff, amazing views & a great value cheap lunch offer.Second the bad bits:Our Singapore Stopover Package (page 35) stated ""Fly with us to Sentosa, Mount Faber and Harbourfront"" & offered a free 1-way cable car ride & directed us to Harbourfront to access the facility. What was not clear was that since Harbourfront is in the middle of the 2 destinations you can only get to one destination - hence we ended up at Mount Faber with the prospect of paying 40$+ just to get back to Harbourfront on the cable car! Solution - a taxi from just outside the Jewel Box will take you down to the MRT station for less than 7$."
This was the first cable car i had been on in my life around 6 years back so was looking forward to it. Since then had been on quite a few other cable cars too with more unique views hence the slight disappointment. The walk from Harbourfront MRT to the boarding point was quite a bit for old people. We went as a big family group and used the 50% off scheme else cable car seemed bit expensive. The car itself moves really slow so can easily take snaps and enjoy the view of sentosa. Additionally its really steady and doesnt make noises either which was great. Its nice to do once to enjoy the view.
"The ride is a bit fast. But you can see a good aerial view of the Sentosa, the nearby port and some skyline. The regular cabin is not airconditioned so expect a bit humid room especially when riding around 10am till early afternoon."
We did the cable car as my daughter loves them. It is a smooth operation however overpriced. Should provide a 1 way option. Also the electric doors at the ticket office are not good when there is a queue. Would not revisit.
"We are sure glad that the singapore cable car is wheelchair accessible because not a lot of attractions are available to the wheelchair-bound. We took one from Harbourfront. However, upon reaching Sentosa, there were only escalators going up & down the Merlion Plaza, no ramp, so 4 park staff helped me on the escalator. They should really do something about this."
"The cable car is the best way to go to Sentosa island as it provides a great view of the city, the harbor, as well as the island. Unfortunately, there seems to be a disconnect between Mt. Faber, which operates the cable car and Sentosa. I purchased online a day pass for Sentosa and this includes a return trip on the cable car. However, when we went to Mt. Faber, they refused us and insisted we first get our tickets from Sentosa. The same happened when we went to the Harbor view office of Mt. Faber and the guy at the ticket counter was a bit rude in handling our concerns. I assumed that this being Singapore, this two business partners could somehow connect to make it easier for customers, but apparently, I was wrong. I would have rated this higher if not for this poor service."
"Once is enough.This ride will give a you good view of Singapore and Sentosa, over Sentosa you'll see the pools of Resorts World then you'll say you wish you there.I tried the Ngong Ping 360 in Hong Kong, so I guess this cable car is ordinary. The smaller kids would love the Angry Bird cars though. Nice touch."
"Cable car goes from Sentosa to Harbour front and then on to Mount Faber. A 15 minute journey in total. Cost around 29 SGD per person which is expensive for such a short journey.Absolutely nothing at Mount Faber except for an expensive an unintesting restaurant.Try to terminate your ride at Harbour Front, where you will find a shopping mall called Vivo City. They have a great food court where the meals are very good value for money.This ride is definitely not worth the money."
"Well, if you are not used to riding cable car, it is a nice ride. But the view is just OK. If you want to see Singapore from above, there are much better options for that. And the angry bird theme? Please...who wants to listen to a theme song for a stupid mobile game while watching wonderful Singapore from above? It looks like angry birds is all over the island, even at terminal 3 at changi:) A little bit expensive ride, but people seems willing to pay that amount for it. So the price stays."
"This is probably one of the average attractions in Singapore, if you never been to a cable car before, you can give it a try otherwise its just a regular cable car journey. If you are a photo enthusiastic then you may get some nice snaps of the marina and also the beach from top."
"before 7pm the ticket priced at 29 dollars a person. offering fantastic view of RWS and also Sentosa. try a ride after 7pm, night breeze is cool. may wanna try the 4 course dinner in the air next time :)"
"Went with wife and 2 kids on 21 dec 2012, cost approx 100 Singapore dollars. Not a great deal to see but if you are on holiday in Singapore you have to fill your time so you will probably want to go. Note, if you are going to spend time on sentosa island then the cable car ride is included in the 1 day sentosa play pass which I think cost about 200 Singapore dollars for the 4 of us and allows you to go on most of the attractions on sentosa (excluding universal studios). If you are not going to sentosa then I reckon the Singapore flyer is better value (30 mins ride as opposed to 15 mins on cable car)."
It's an expensive ride for a lot of money. We thought it might be worthwhile to at least take some pictures from the cable car. But it was really too short and the scenery is really not that great compared to many other cable car rides around the world.
It was a pleasant ride. But you can't always see with people moving around the car. You get a much better view of Sinapore from the Flyer but you get a good view of Sentosa Island from the Cable Car.
"Our 4 year old grandson is crazy about ""Angry Birds"". When we were in Singapore the cable car to Sentosa had a temporary Angry Birds theme, so we had to take the ride. The view was great. He enjoyed it very much so I guess I would recommend the ride to all travelling with young children. The buses on Sentosa are free so you can get around the island easily. Personally I preferred Sentosa as it was 40 years ago! However if you like theme parks you will like it."
"you can see the singapore , sentosa and singapore port from the cable car. view is nice from the top. everyone can enjoy the view from top. night view is excellant also."
"The cable car ride affords the opportuntity to see Singapore from the air. The view of the water is great leading to Sentosa. It is a different way to get to Sentosa and it certainly brings into view all that is commercial and 'theme park' about Sentosa. It had been many years since taking this trip and while theme parks are great family days out, for me Sentosa had lost a lot of its earlier charm. Not for the fainthearted who are scared of heights."
"...and the view is a lot of office blocks, a bit of water and you're there. Nto Cape Town or the Alps - a taxi si quicker and less hassle."
"We took the very last cable car ride for the evening (""only"" 20SGD), and we were told not to get off the cable car on Sentosa island, but rather come straight back, or we'll have to come back by taxi.Well, for 20 SGD it was a short ride (10 minute all the way to Sentosa island and back), but the view was amazing, both of the city and of Sentosa island."
29SGD for a return trip is a bit too much. It is quite hot inside and the view was just okay until it reached over the cruise liner and Sentosa resorts.
"Overpriced, overrated but nonetheless something to experience in Singapore. There are much better things to do though."
"The veiws over the city are great, it was nice to relax after walking around Vivo City & the Harbour Front for ages and a novel way to get to Sentosa. We felt it was overpriced though so if you are on a tight budget we would say this isn't a 'must do' in our opinion, but enjoyable if you are not concerned about cost. We were lucky not to have to share a car on the first leg of the ride so could move around and take pics, on the way down we had other people in with us and it was impossible to get a pic of anything."
"a good place but the price for a ride was pretty expensive! but overall still good! the staff was normal and the services was also normal, nothing much to complain about except for the price."
"I travelled to sentosa in the cable car, we were 4 guys. It was an ok expereince. The height was good and a lot of greenery to see udnerneath. But its nothing extremely different. But if you have to go to Sentosa, then this is probably the best way. Take pictures, that would be memorable."
Nothing big or fancy here - quite simply a cable car ride that can be enjoyed by those of all ages. Definitely the best way to go into Sentosa as the view of the island is great. Try to avoid traveling in the car during the peak heat of the day as the sun warms the cars up and they get quite hot! A must-do activity whilst in Singapore.
It might look a touch expensive and the cable ride might be too small length wise .... but it was worth spending the amount and use this .... You get to see a beautiful view of the city and Sentosa Island ....The cars we were in were very clean and well managed .... We took a combo package which included couple of other activities to utilise from many options ....Should go there after you have been to Universal Studios ... Next day would be better ....
It makes for an interestingly different way of travelling to Sentosa island from Singapore. There are special capsules also which are decked for a romantic trip across. One can see the sentosa merlion from above as well and it was a peaceful interlude in the hectic sight-seeing schedule that we had that day( which had us doing Jurong bird park by morning and Sentosa island by the afternnon through the evening!)
We catch the cable car from santos after a day in the universal studio. The cost for 2 adult & 1 child return $79.00. Very pricing for a short trip. But great view & smooth ride.We will not be doing this trip again.
"Everyone told me how great it would be, but I didnt see something that they did obviously. Maybe I was just expecting more because of all the great reviews."
"The ride itself was not that long compared to the Cable Car in HK but the scenery was very good especially when getting near Sentosa. Since i was with my family (4), we applied for the Jewel Card family membership for unlimited access for 1 year by paying S$99. Initially, they offered the Angry Birds family membership worth S$139 but I told the counter personnel that I will not opt for it. Otherwise, I would have paid for $29 per person and that will only be good for one trip. The deal I got should be good for a family of four who has also just settled in Singapore.From Harbourfront Tower, you can opt to go directly to Sentosa or go to Mount Faber. However, since this is a loop ride, it would be best to first go to Sentosa then Mount Faber especially if you're buying a ticket and not getting the Jewel Card."
"Try it at night, it's beautiful ! Good place for photographers, as you can capture almost the whole Singapore!"
"all I can say is it's just ok... once is enough.You do get a fare bit of ride in the cable car, and the view of sentosa and PSA (port of singapore)but nothing so thrillingIf you just want to go to sentosa, monorail is a better optionIf you just want to go to mt faber/jewel box, a bus or taxi will take you thereit's not a mean of transport to get you to one of the above, but mainly the attraction in itself, which as i said in the rating, just average."
"Took cable car from Mount Faber (ok panoramic views) to Sentosa & back to harbour front. Got nice views of harbour front area & Sentosa's rides & ships out to sea. Imo unless u want to go Sentosa, u better views of city from Marina Bay Sands."
"Cost for cable car alone, from Harbour Front to Sentosa, one way is SGD24.00 yet return ticket is SGD26.00! Next time we'll walk across the boardwalk."
Way too expensive for a ride. Nice views of Singapore harbour and Sentosa island though. Go once for the experience and it would be quite enough.
"The car moved at a desirable speed, not too fast nor too slow. It offered a good view of Sentosa island and Mt. Faber. Not recommended for those with claustrophobia or acrophobia though. Better buy a round trip ticket than a one-way ticket."
"I shouldn't have gone on this cable car. Nothing special about it, and it doesn't come cheap. Sure they say it comes with admission to the cable car museum, but there's not much to see there. Should've gone somewhere else."
"Have been on the cable car twice near. Definitely better at night than in the day but very expensive compared to other options to get to Sentosa.Light rail costs $3 for the day compared with more than $17 for the cable car (and I think that rate was discounted because we went at night).Overall nice views but if you are interested in views, the Singapore Flyer has better/longer lasting views."
"The cable car is a fun way to get to Sentosa, but the ride is very short. Especially for the price. If you want to do it, I recommend only taking it one way. A one-way ticket is $10, while the round trip is $26/person. The ride itself is about five minutes, maybe less."
"Nice way to go to Sentosa, short ride with a beauitful view, but overpriced of course. 22SP$ for a two way ticket."
"Taking a trip on the cable car was an attempt to see Singapore from different angles and maybe get some photographs of the islands and beyond. It was not a good day for this as the haze was pronounced and visibility was low but as I have a flight out tomorrow, it was the only chance.I got on the cable car at HarbourFront - easy to find and well signposted. I had originally wanted only to go to the hill station at Mount Faber but was told the ticket was valid for Sentosa too. I could have chosen a package of places to visit but these did not tempt me (inclusive costs seemed to range from about $S69 - 81 per adult). The cost of the full trip was $S26.00I had the cable car to myself and snapped away - however the heat was tremendous and most embarassingly I had rivers of sweat pouring off me by the time I reached Mount Faber after what seemed like only a few minutes. Fake cherry trees were placed around the edge and when I tried to find my way out of the cable car platform (apart from the viewing platform and gift shop) all the exits had chains across them. I didn't ask if I could descend to road level and have a look around as I was so hot and sticky. After a cold coke ($S3.00) I thought I would take the full trip to Sentosa as I had hardly had my money's worth. The next car (and the subsequent one) were better ventilated and I made it to Sentosa without melting, took a few pictures of the Merlion but failed to avail myself of the 11 attractions on offer as they held little interest. As a person of more mature years, I just wasn't enticed by them but no doubt, if it had been 25 years earlier, my children might have enjoyed Tiger Ride (shooting I forget how many feet up into the air and down again), the Butterfly Park or actually going into the Merlion who seems a bit like the cousin of the concrete Big Merino. And it certainly wasn't the proprietors' fault that the visibility was so poor."
"We've been on cable cars much scarier and views a little prettier (think New Mexico's ascent to their mountains) but somehow this was still fun.We started by taking a cab to Mt. Faber, exploring the jewel box and some of the centerpieces they had around the complex as well as the views which was quite pleasant. We then took the car from there all the way over to Sentosa.Ride was smooth and quick (the cars actually move quite fast in my opinion) and we took some time to explore the cable car museum (available when you get off in Sentosa) which was interesting (they have a car constructed entirely out of legos!).Once you've done it once, no need to do it again."
"I took the cable car on a one way trip to Sentosa in the middle of the day (clear skies). I would recommend one way only and catching the monorail / bus back - it's not worth a return trip. To get full value for money, catch a taxi (e.g. from the rank outside Vivocity) up to the top of Mt Faber so you can catch the cable car the full way down. Don't expect fantastic photos - the cabin windows are scratched plastic. Better shots of Singapore (of the city) can be had from the Singapore Flyer with clear glass viewing. Note: cable car is closing 15 August 2009 until mid 2010 for renovations with improved cabins - so it should only get better."
"We were on Sentosa island for the day , we had walked miles and we talked about taking the cable car back to main land , we enquired at the ticket office , shocked to hear the price for 2 adults one way back 160.00 sing dollars , unrealistic price not ask ,So we walked back and saved the money for something else ."
"Cost way too much for a 10min ride back to the city. Cost us over $100 for 2 Adults & 2kids, then was a very short windy ride."
We purchased tickets for the cable car ride and SEA Aquarium and were very excited to see Sentosa Island. We stood in line for the cable cars and were crammed in a car with a big group of people who stood up the whole time to take pictures. I got stepped on a few times and we decided to take a taxi instead of the round trip that we purchased. We did not have a pleasant experience.
"My partnter & I and an American couple got on the Cable car from Mt Faber as advised by our hotel concierge. This way our ride would be longer and we would see more of the city.The initial trip over to Sentosa Island went without a hitch.We got on the cable car and rode back to Mt Faber early evening after spending the day exploring Sentosa Island..Upon getting off the cable car we discovered, that there was no taxi stand at Mt Faber to take us back to our hotel.None of us had a mobile phone.None of the cable car staff would assist us by telephoning for a taxi for us (we politely asked several ticket staff and staff we found inside the building, plus the security people outside they all refused)We spent approx 20 mins asking for assistance to no avail.Eventually a young man at the restaurant rang a taxi for us.We were really appreciative for his helpWe were first time visitors to the Singapore and were appalled at the lack of help we received from the Cable Car & Security staff."
We found this experience to be overpriced for what it is. The customer service at the counter was unable to explain clearly what the differences in passes meant. The only good thing was the day we used it we went over in the morning and back at night which meant we got a view of the night lights.
"The special thing about the cable car is the views, but the views aren't that great, and can be accessed fro: many other places. Additionally, the lines can be really bad, and it can get really annoying at times. If you're going to sentosa, just get a cab. It's the best and easiest way to go, even if you pay a premium."
"When you go to the ticket office, it gives the impression that you can get a cable car ticket for $18. But that isn't the case. It's $35. Considering the short journey and the cash cow at the other end of it. Please don't waste your money. This truly truly isn't worth it. Simply go to a tall building nearby and go to the top floor, it'll be far cheaper and you'll get the same view."
"Arriving in pouring rain there was no shelter to get to the cable car that was very expensive. Due to the bad weather, there was no queue and at the same time, one can not see the panorama. At the mid station, there was no one who could give information about further options or change to the other line.On the way back we chose the train, so the cable car adventure was a fail."
"So ended up paying twice as the tour operator cocked up and booked me in the day before, staff there didnt care and made me pay again. Did three laps for cold mushroom soup, a nice duck salad, ok beef and nice salmon and an ok dessert with a small glass of wine and coffee.If I were you I'd just do one lap in the car."
"$35 return for a few minutes. Went for the $4return monorail trip instead. I read numerous reviews prior to our decision; yes the view would be great, but at a cost of $70 for both of us?"
"Taking the cableway to the hill is disappointing: the hill is not vey high, the view is exceptionally limited, there is no viewing platform (what view there is is largely taken by restaurants), and the cableway is relatively expensive. There are significantly higher and better views from Marina Sands deck and the Singapore Eye."
This is Very disappointing it takes you to a look out and theres nothing much to see or do except restaurantVERY BORINGIt also takes to to Santosa
"Expensive, I understand how the price is build and it's ok, but at the end of the day I just feel like the attraction itself so as views were just ""whatever"". (Singapore Flyer was way better).Staff was very polite and helpful."
"We were led to believe that the cable car was the best way to get to Universal Studios on Sentosa. It's definitely the most expensive and the lengthiest and if you like long queues and standing out in the heat, then definitely pay the exorbitant entrance fee.We booked online but you still have to stand in line at the ground floor of the station house to collect you actual paper ticket. Then more queueing at the top of the station house as you wait for the cable car to arrive. Granted, the views from the cable car are spectacular and our kids loved the ride, but it was very quick and we were soon on a Sentosa and walking down a long hill to the bus stop to wait 15-minutes for the Universal Studios bus, which is a misnomer as the bus serves ALL attractions so it was jammed packed. A 10 minute hard fought bus ride later we arrived at our destination.We discovered too late that the last cable car departs Sentosa at 6:30 pm (seriously?) so we had to find an alternative route off Sentosa which was when we discovered that a regular city bus runs from the mainland directly to Universal Studios and back. And there was no charge back to the mainland (you only pay for the service to Sentosa).So, in conclusion, don't waste your time or money taking the cable car - take the bus. It will only cost you a $1 or $2 and will take you far less time while being a whole lot more comfortable."
"The view from the cable car is great. We caught it up to mount Fabre, and then across to the island. It was relatively quiet do we had a carriage to ourselves which was nice.Unfortunately we were unable to catch it back from the island to the main land as they had stopped it for some reason. Staff were not helpful about how to catch the bus back with no one directing people to where they needed to go to get the bus. Only a sign at the cable car announced the service outage with staff watching people walk up to read the sign rather than helping direct and explain what was happening. We ended up getting an Uber off the island as we had no idea how long s bus was going to be. There was no refund for the missed trip."
"Pretty views. Ordered round trip tickets online and had vouchers on phone. Receives cardboard tickets that I misplaced at the other side of the island. Whereas everywhere else in the developed world they would give you a one way trip back to your departure, to replace the ticket, this company refuses. Horrible situation for my two children of 4 and 6. Terrible management for an otherwise nice attraction. Shame on you."
considering the cost .. its only a 2-3 min ride . most of the things in singapore are hyped .. actually very very hyped. be carefull. if u can take advice from those who have already travelled but dont boast about them travelling to Singapore.
"If you've ever been in a cable car before then this experience offers nothing new or exciting. We were informed by the information desk near our hotel that the cable car is overpriced and not worth the time but we decided to give it a go. We were disappointed with the views as you don't see much other than the water parks on Sentosa Island, wouldn't recommend."
"The views are something you can get in even if you walk down towards sentosa. The Cable car itself is a supposedly a part of the public transport system, and costs 35$ for a single journey!"
Went with great expectations.Before we settled down the ride was over. Not much to see. It was a worthless effort for the money paid ..
if you are a person who has done a cable car than this does not provide something new or exiting except that the view of the city is given to you from a height.
The over all transportation in Sentosa Island is complicated and this cable car was not working between Singapore City and Island. We had to take the Cable car within the Island and it was not worth the money.
"There are cheaper options if you're just trying to get from point A to point B. Yes, the cable cars offer nice views, but other than the theme parks, there's really not much else to see. Recommended if you are pressed for time and just want to have a quick and easy overview of Sentosa. Otherwise, just stick to the casino and call it a day. Or just skip Sentosa altogether"
This cable car is so expensive for what it is and then you get to Sentosa and have to pay more money again if you want to go on the one there. Totally regretted this decision. I paid online so got it a little cheaper and only used it 1 way as we stayed late on the island and got the train back instead. Save your money for something more worthwhile.
"Quite expensive.Not much to see and do on the Sentosa island. Everything looks old, except the aquarium is ok but nothing special."
"Okay, but seriously expensive for what it is. Sentosa, the State of Fun(ds) is overpriced and this just adds to it. Better off walking from the Mt Faber cable car station and over the Henderson waves bridge along the Kent Ridge. Then take a taxi and enjoy a Singapore Sling, or two, at Raffles for the same price."
This was our biggest disappointment in Singapore. The cable car was very expensive if you only wanted a one way ticket (not available) $GD50. Now you can walk to the island from the MRT. The island has changed into a Disney world and not for the better. The old Sentosa kept some of the jungle and charm of the island.
There's nothing wrong with the cable car service as the infrastructure is well maintained and managed. However given the hot and humid weather of Singapore the ride wasn't exactly a fun experience as it does get stuffy and hot inside the car.They do have mini fans to help keep things cool but it doesn't really help much given the heat and weather of Singapore.The only good thing about the cable car is that it offers a bird eye view of Sentosa island and also it's attraction which is something for first time visitors.However I would suggest to take the train option to sentosa island as it may be a better and economical choice compared to the cable car.
We did this trip after 12 yrs mainly for our 10.5 yr old son.The cable car ride no longer has many tourists queueing up for it. Most tend to take the FREE Sentosa Express (Monorail). The cable car ride gives aerial views of Sentosa but nothing exciting. The chairlift at Sky Luge Sentosa beats this.The ride from Mt Faber Peak to Harbour Front is nothing exciting but comes bundled in the tkt price. No aircon but has battery operated tiny fans. Expensive !! And no refunds ! We booked the combination tkt - Sentosa Line along with Mt Faber line. We were unable to use the Sentosa Line but we were disappointed to find out about their no refund policy :-(
"I had booked a tour to Sentosa Island but we could not use it because something was wrong with it and they could not operate it. But coming back from Sentosa Island, it was working again and the experience was fantastic!"
"We were being jolly lazy and only wanted an easy way to go up to Mount Faber. We got the MRT to Vivo City and walked to the cable car station. We queued for 20 minutes watching staff treat customers with total indifference. We were then told we could only go up to Mount Faber if we purchased a SGD$26pp ticket that included the entrance fee to Sentosa Island - all tickets include this entrance fee, want it or not!We overcame our laziness and walked up th small hill and back in about 90 minutes (at a stroll)."
"I recently went to take the cable cars to Sentosa, great view from Mount Faber but for a family with teens I thought this was over priced for how long it takes so we did not go as the flyer is cheaper."
"As a local tourist, I must say that I am disappointed by the poor customer service. I was enticed to buy the family membership of $120. However on several occasions, I went up. There was no feedback on when the cable car service was closed for maintenance wasting my trip up to Mount Faber for the ride. Mimially, they should just sent some email to us to inform us about this so that we can be more playful and intentional in planning our trip or put it on the website. There was an occasion where I forgot to bring my own card. However, I brought my children's card. Hence, I asked for help as it was troublesome to go back home. They told me coldly to go home and that means 2 hours to come back to and fro. We gave up riding on that day. I asked to see the customer service manager and was told to take the lift. There were 3 lifts in the cable car towers and I just don't know which one to take to see the customer service manager. The customer service manager should be stationed downstairs to support the customer and not in some ivory tower. I hope thy pick on this feedback and improve on their customer relations"
"October 2015 . The Trip with the Cable Car is nice , and that is it . Mount Faber is nothing . Sentosa is like Disneyland , if you know it from before you will be shocked"
"For the price, I was expecting something special and was rather disappointed. The views from Faber peak were not all that spectacular. The views of Sentosa Island were OK but it would have been better to be on the island itself as the cable car ride was a somewhat detached experience"
We went over on our way to universal studios and paid $29 each. I had been looking forward to this but after five minutes it was over and on the way back I got just as good a view from the train. Which doesn't cost anything. Give it a miss
"The view was OK, but very short distance. I think it doesn't worth the money. Better choose Sentosa Express to go to Sentosa Island and you can also use it on the island too."
It was a short and overpriced ride to go to Sentosa. One gets a much better view of Singapore from the Singapore Flyer and it costs the same. Save your money for the flyer and take the monorail express to go to Sentosa
We took the cable cars with a return ticket but got told when we arrived it was only one way ...overall Sentosa I think is overrated .. kids would probably like it but you would need very deep pockets. map was useless & the signs were worse .. Need to do your research before you go ... Where the cable cars arrive is in the middle of nowhere .. & it's no fun if you are lost & no one who works there has any idea where anything is ....not a fan !
"Expensive, but pleasant enough. We used it to get across to Sentosa in style. Was not very busy at all.Staff could have been friendlier and more helpful though - they sent us down to the ground floor, to come back up again to go to the top of the mountain - a total waste of 15 minutes."
Be very careful if you intend using the cable car and then visit Universal Sudios.The ticket seller tried to sell us a combined cable car with admission to universal studios included for $101dollar. The cable car is $28 and day pass to Universal is $38.I tried to report this to their management but no one seemed interested or surprised.
"Our family has decided not to go back there again. We had different expectation about it. It was so boring. Far from excitement. We couldnt wait to get of from the see through tube.May be it would be good for a romantic dinner or a forced business deal, that make you couldnt escape from the thing before you sign the contract."
"Don't bother with this attraction. Yes, the views of Sentosa are OK. But we just wanted to do a quick loop and not stop anywhere. 10 minutes and $150SGD (family of 5) later and it just left a disappointing taste in our mouths. Fellow travellers were also complaining about the exorbitant prices at the cafe at the top of the mountain. They also had this stupid & cheesy Superhero theme to the ride where they wanted to charge you more to participate! There are so many other wonderful things to see and do in Singapore. This is not one of them."
"For some reason I took the cable car over to Sentosa. It is pricey and not interesting at all. If you have ever riden a cable car, there is absolutely no need to go on this one. The sights aren't great. They pack the cars full, so you get to ride with others.On the positive side, the lines weren't as long as I feared. Not bad at all. But if you just want to se Sentosa, take the small train instead. This was not 29 well spent S$."
"This cable car is clean, smooth and fast with beautiful views. However it is very expensive and you cannot buy a one way ticket. We went over by bus to Sentosa and thought we would take the cable car back. They wouldn't let us get a one way ticket so we paid $58SD for a 10 minute trip."
Great views but be careful if you expect the super hero experience where you can take pictures with Batman etc flying behind you. Not all the cars have the technology fitted and no-one tells you that when you get on. Our children were very disappointed when we realised that ours did not and we were refused a refund despite a lengthy discussion. For $94 SGD it was pretty poor customer service.
Pretty boring. Doesn't get very high. Not much on either side of the cable car. If you are going to Sentosa might be the way to go. But Sentosa is not really worthwhile either.
Family of 5 Was ridiculously expensive Cost over $100 for us to travel by cable cars There was no air conditioning in the cars and only tiny windows Found out the next day we could walk to island for $1 each View was nice but ride was short and deinately not worth it
"I was going ti sentosa at peak season, in december... Really long queque.. What i like is the beautiful scenery from above. We could see sentosa to vivo city.. What i dislike: it was too expensive for only short round. And what the worse was happening when the staff allowed other persons to sit with us in the same cable car.. I was going with my dad and mom, so total we were three. But, the staff allowed 2 someone else to be with us...Really not worth every penny..."
The price is to high compare the view. The ride is short and what more to write. Compare with the cable car in Taipei this here is nothing so no more visit here.
I payed 29 SGD for a round trip with cable car to Santosa IslandI belive the trip is not wort it as not much to see on Santosa Island (except if you have kids) . Each ride costs around 20 SGD therfore is quite expensive.
"Out of all the attractions in Singapore, this shouldn't make the top 50 list. It's expensive, it has almost no views and takes you to Mount Faber which barely has anything to show and is packed with expensive restaurants. Comparing this to other cable cars in the region (like Hong Kong) or the views you get from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel platform, this cable car ride makes no sense.Unless you or your kids get any kicks from the Angry Birds theme, stay away from this ""attraction""."
The ride is short. The angry birds theme rather appalling. When you arrive at Mount Faber there is not much to see and do. We wanted to have a drink at the Bistro but the service was terrible and the bottle of beer we got looked like ages old... The only interesting thing was the view of the huge container harbor on the way to Sentosa. If you don't have excessively time don't bother.
"I read in another review on Trip Advisor that the Cable Car offers better views and value than the Flyer but after trying both, my personal preference is the Flyer (if you're going to choose just one). The views from the Cable Car are beautiful, and the attraction is clean and well run. The down side for me was that the ride is very short and there isn't a map provided to help you understand what you're looking at. Plus, you get the same views from the top of the mountain, so you can save some money and just take a taxi or bus to the top.If you decide to check out this attraction and you're a local, the year pass offers the best value. For just $9 more than the cost of a single round-trip ride you get unlimited Cable Car rides, access to Sentosa and a 20% discount when you buy a ride pass for a friend/visitor."
"The Singapore cable car has a great product - a scenic cable car from wooded Mount Faber through Harbour Front to Sentosa, but the management and pricing of the attraction is disappointing. The whole experience is set up to maximise revenue rather than any focus on the customer experience or customer satisfaction. For example:Why is there no automated ticketing? How hard is it to sell tickets from a machine instead of making people stand in line? Instead, you have to stand in a long queue to purchase ticket seemingly sold by under-motivated, slow staff, whose numbers seem disproportionate to their productivity. Three staff members today and only one till open. The staff exist only to try to sell confusing packages. The woman in front of me was told it would be cheaper for her to buy a ticket for her three year old who was technically free because then she would benefit from an even bigger discount than if she bought the tickets separately. The ticket prices and ticket selling are a joke process designed to confuse customers and distract them from the high prices being charged.Why can't they sell one way tickets? We were three adults and three children who wanted to take the cable car one way from Mount Faber to Harbour Front. We had completed a hike and needed to get down from the hill. But you can't buy one way tickets, or you can, but the return ticket is the same price. Instead we paid $99 for various packages and promotions which featured Angry Birds drinks and masks, and probably the full trip to Sentosa and back. I felt completely ripped off and angry at having waited ten minutes to be gouged. The Singapore residents in the queue in front felt the same as they spent a good ten minutes like us trying to work out what package they were being sold and arguing at the nonsensical muddle that is the sales process.You're running a cable car which goes from A to B to C. Not difficult to organise one way tickets and ride only fares surely? But not if your objective is to rip off the punters.Summary: I enjoyed the ride in the cable car, I didn't enjoy being taken for a ride by the management."
It's a mini fun park that's all . May be good for family with kids but not a lots to see.
"Cable car ride offers good views of Sentosa and mainland Singapore, but at 26SGD return ticket for a 10 minute per direction trip, it is overpriced. View is not so spectacular as to warrant this price. $3 monorail is much better option.For romantic dining option, however, this may be okay. It is certainly a unique date/celebration idea to dine in cable car from/to Jewel Box."
"This is a very expensive short trip. Yes the cars are clean and well maintained but at a cost of $78 for myself and my 2 daughters to do a short trip to Mt Faber, then to Sentosa and back I would far rather take the $3 express to Sentosa and a cab up Mt Faber. I have been on other cable cars elsewhere in the world and this would be the worst value for money anywhere. Others obviously agreed it was overpriced judging by the people that left the ticket office without buying tickets once they realised how much it would cost. Sentosa was also overpriced and empty when we went."
A boring ride. Not much scenery to enjoy. Relatively expensive; not worth the price!
"Well, the view is ok. But the price is not.I do not think this attraction give you value for money."
We went here to ride on the cable cars which are out of order until sometime in 2010 so we were bused to the top of the mount. There was nothing much there and the views pretty poor. Think they turn this area into a christmas wonderland so think that is the only time its worth visiting!
"I have a terrible and unpleasant experience with the bad customer service provided by the One Faber Group staffs. I have utilised the rediscover Singapore vouchers with Klook for my cable car ride. Klook has sent me 5 QR codes for 5 tickets bought. Upon entry to board the cable car, the staff claimed that there was issues with 2 of my QR code tickets. She then advised me to go to the ticketing counter to redeem the 2 QR code tickets which have issues. I then proceed to the ticketing counter as per her advice. However, the staffs at ticketing counter gave me a different advice. They requested that I have to pay for the two tickets which have issues. After which, I have to write in to Klook to request for a refund for the 2 tickets paid. I then asked the ticketing staffs for a better alternative to resolve my ticketing issues. I explained to them that it is unfair for consumers to pay for the tickets out of their own pockets and has to chase the refund from Klook due to the glitch by Klook. I tried patiently to reason with them. The staff then tried to call Klook for half an hour but in avail. I had to wait for them to resolve the issue. I wanted to speak to the manager but could only get him 15mins later. In the end, he did not provide a satisfactory solution to my problem and keep emphasing that the problem lies with Klook and not with One Faber Group. This is certainly a very unpleasant and bad customer service provided by One Faber Group. I feel that I was being penalised for some glitches in the travel app. Especially in consumers' views, they did not provide an amicable solution to the issues which were not caused by consumers. I will certainly not recommend any family and friends to take cable car rides because of the customer service provided was utterly disappointing, unsatisfactory and unprofessional."
"Would've expected a form of proper ventilation system in the cabin given the sheer humidity of Singapore's weather.It was hot and stuffy and would have expected at least more windows, or even a cooling system (like a fan).It was expensive for the experience received."
Worst experience in Cable car. BEWARE if you are buying an open ticket. Please make sure you visit there website to check maintenance dates. There are 2 lines - 1 mount faber line and another sentosa line. As we were not aware we have started Sentosa line and completed which very small line and then we wanted to go for Mount faber line. The staff informed us that it was on maintenance. I feel like cheated because they should have put notice board outside the sentosa line that another line is in maintenance so we will not utilize the ticket as you can only use the ticket for both the line on same day so we approach staff ask them to if they can validate so we can come tomorrow or next weekend but that was the worst experience. STAFF ARE NOT FRIENDLY AT ALL. They will ask you to check with you agent where you bought the tickets (which is almost 1 month ago). THIS IS REALLY RIDICULOUS.MAKE SURE TO CHECK THEIR WEBSITE FOR MAINTENANCE DATES AS STAFF ARE NOT GONNA BE HELPFUL AT ALL
We took the sentosa boardwalk route to walk over with the intention of taking the cable car back however when we tried to buy a ticket they would not sell us a one-way journey. I have no idea why. This makes no sense. There is an express monorail type train for free so we took that back instead but we can't be the only people who wanted to take one route out and a different one back.Nonsensical.
We booked a ticket the das before we went there. And they didn't manage to send us the tickets early enough. By the way you have to que anyway. We needed to call the service and still waiting for the tickets.
If you want to feel stupid then buy the dinner option! It is expensive not worth a penny! Buy the cheapest ticket and do the cable tour and then go have dinner somewhere else and have a good bite. Do not believe anyone rhat this is an amazing experience because it is not. You do certainly not need to turn round over same place for 1h30 and have a meal that is inflated to the maximum with no taste to write the least
WE wanted to travel to Sentosa via the Cable Car and walk back to Vivo City but they wouldn't allow us or anybody to buy a single ticket - you had to buy a return ticket and that's all they would sell. Well they missed out.
"I purchased a ticket for the cable car to go from mount father to Sentosa from the Sentosa online store. I received an electronic ticket which includes tickets for the aquarium and universal studios. I got off the train at harbour front and took a tiresome walk up to mount Faber. At the ticket counter I'm told I can't redeem my ticket at the ticket kiosk.I'm very disappointed, I'm told to go back to harbour front to redeem my ticket and there's apparently small print on my ticket that says to do so.Very poor instructions and the ticket seller made no effort to assist me.Not impressed"
If it's a clear calm day stay away from this zoo of a ride that entices you with the convenience of online ticket purchase but then requires you to que up to collect tickets in the same line with all those looking for information and buying tickets while under utilized staff stand by.
The cable car trip to Sentosa Island and back was fine a great way to see the sites. We (two of us) however pre-purchased a double ticket which included the Mt Faber and Sentosa Line as a package. When we arrived on the island the Sentosa Line was not working and staff could not tell us when it would be up and running. When we had to leave it was still out of action and staff would not refund any money Would have been cheaper to buy it on the day as we would have only had to pay for one line
"We pre-purchased Day Fun Pass Play 5 for Santosa, which included ""Cable Car"" as per T&C, and headed to the Ticketing counter at Tower 2 in Habourfront to catch the cable car to Santosa. The staff there advised that such type of tickets must be redeemed on Level 3 at Vivo City.I went all the way to find the place as advised by the cable car staff, and came back with the formal passes redeemed.Upon using the passes to get on the cable car, other staff told me that I had to go back down to Level 1 to exchange for the tickets for the trip, which I did.Went all the way back to Level 1 from Level 10 in the 30 degree hot humid weather. And then surprisingly, the staff at the ticketing counter told me this time that the ""Cable Car"" included in the Fun Pass for Santosa can NOT be used for the cable car to Santosa. I questioned him why his staff didn't tell me when I first came to redeem my eTickets. The reply from him was I can make a complaint!!! That's it.As a tourist with 2 small children from overseas, I didn't know that the Cable Car included in Santosa Fun Pass is not for Cable Car to Santosa. When I started explaining what's happened to other staff, my 7 years old son just told me in a different language ""Dad, they don't care what you have complained at all""."
"I just don't understand why such a high technology and developed country like Singapore can not train an employee that's working at the cable car station at Mt. Faber.We were forced to ride a cable car with other people as animals...!We didn't mind to ride with other people even on our honeymoon trip, which we love to have a private time.But, all you had to do was 'just ask nicely'As we spend time in Sentosa for our honeymoon trip, the first impression was bad, we knew that the cable car seat arrangement Indian girl can speak many languages,But the only language she can't speak is 'SERVICE MIND LANGUAGE'As I mentioned before 'we are not animals'Don't treat a person that bring you a money like this....!"
"Most fantastic view I have ever seen ,Just incredible and with one day pass it's most economic to go to sentosa island ."
"It's a small distance and a nice view.You know that in advance. What you don't know is that Dopoelmayer obviously didn't train the personell on how to operate a cable car in an efficient way, meaning moving a maximum of people as quick as possible.They will let empty and almost empty cable cars pass while there' s a line of a 100m of people waiting.I am used to much more efficient operations from skiing in Austrian."
My friend d convinced me to do this. Ride was smooth but it is so high I couldn't look!navoid this attraction if you dislike heights
Don't waste your money and time unless you use the cable car as transportation to the attraction park which is a small wanna be Orlando theme park.Staff super impolite and you are better off by saving the $33 per adult by using the big wheel to get an overview of the city.
"Two years ago I hiked the Southern Ridges trail from the Harbour Front MRT. This time I brought 4 friends. One suggested we take the cable car to the top of Mt. Faber and hike down.The cable car ride costs $29 each. $145 for 5 of us. As soon as the car leaves the station you can see your destination and people exiting cable cars at the other station maybe 1,000 feet ahead (just an estimate). We all started laughing. That's it? $29?What a rip off. You can walk to the top of Mt. Faber in short order from Harbour Front MRT or just take a taxi/Uber there. While I'm at it ... Mt. Faber is a hill not a mountain.The Southern Ridges hike was excellent."
A bit of a tourisp trap. We asked for a round trip to mt faber but got the combined ticket which includes the sentosa cable car. We were quite specific so they were either ripping us or just couldnt care less. That aside its still too expensive. Not worthwhile as far as I'm concerned.
"When I last reviewed the Singapore Cable Car in 2015 I recommended the ""Faber Licence"" which is effectively a 12 month membership allowing unlimited rides. However, this offer is now restricted to Singapore residents and there is no multi-day pass available to visitors/tourists."
"Never should you risk your time, special occasions or money for this ""dining experience"" which claims to serve gourmet food. We spent $300+ for 2 only to find that we were served stale and insipid seafood that has been frozen since Stone Age, a dessert made entirely out of whipped cream, and a box of chocolates expiring in 3 days (they further claimed that this was the delivery date and not the expiry date). The food arrives on a VERY hot ceramic plate, and the staff serves it with a glove. Very highly and presumably that their ""gourmet"" food is reheated in an oven or stove, and not made by a Chef on the spot. Don't expect any service from the staff who are not willing to go an extra mile for anything else other than serving the designated food, which of course I didn't touch my portion of at all that night. What a way to enjoy my 21st birthday celebration."
"We got on the cable car at Harbour front to Sentosa Island. The cable car is so far away from the city that it wasn't even worth taking a photograph. the main view is of container ships, docks and cranes. It cost around $50 dollars for the Faber Line. When you get to Sentosa there is another cable car that crosses the island for about $13 dollars which I'm sure would be far more interesting and a third of the price. On the return we stayed on the cable car to mount Faber hoping that we might get a decent view but that was worse. Trees obscured all the possible views.I would advise you to get the free shuttle bus or the cheap monorail (about $4 I think) across the bridge to Sentosa and use the cable car on the island itself."
"Book ahead and save yourself alot of time. Its very frustrating. For some reason, the counter acts as a tourist advisory centre and ticket office."
"This is a very expensive form of travel and there are better ways to see Sentosa Island like walking the amazing boardwalk from VivoCity to the Island (which is free, undercover, has traveletors for those that are lazy and keeps you dry from the rain). The cable car is very pricy, so if you are looking for an experience of a cable car than this is good, but does not need to be on the list of things to do in Sentosa."
"There are so many other ways that you can get views of the city, why waste your money here, yes it is unique, but is it worth it?"
"This cable car trip is very nice, but was spoiled by the very expensive ticket price. I paid much less for other attraction and got much more. Not recommended."
"We bought 3 tix for the cable car, starting at merlion station on Sentosa as we were staying at resorts world. My daughters wanted to ride the Mount Faber line, so we had to purchase the Sky Pass tickets to get us onto the Mt Faber line from the merlion station.Whilst riding the Mr Faber line, the line kept stopping and starting, making my children and wife very scared. We were then told to get off at Harbour front station.I asked for a refund, and it took 20 mins before I got an answer, and to my surprise, they told me they will only give me a partial refund as I had already ridden on the cable car. WHAT KIND OF RESPONSE IS THAT!?Very disappointed Singapore Cable Car! You should be ashamed of your customer service!WARNING everyone, if you experience any issues with the ride, don't expect a good outcome if you ask for a refund!"
"Ride is too short for the ridiculous overprice. Especially if you are bringing other people along. Don't bother.Save that money for other things. There are other ways to get to sentosa and there are other free views you can get.Nearby to Mount Faber, 10 minutes walk there is Henderson wave. Can have a nice stroll there rather than wasting."
"Not so impressive. no god view from cable car compare to other cable cars I experienced.Cable car is safe and fine, but unfortunately view is not so good. There are other places, where you can get great views."
"We are regulars here for over 7 or more years but tonight after returning from a long trip to Asia, all we wanted was an easy atmosphere and a burger. Not too much to ask. Burger buns were stale - tasted of mould. Asked for new burger buns. Still tasted of mould. By which time the burger and fries were cold so I asked for a hot burger and fries. So the second burger tasting of mould, over my original burger which was tepid with my original fries which were cold were delivered!!!! Time out!!! Very disappointed."
"Very bad service! Arrogant people working there! Purchase a ticket , it says ""Package is available from 7pm daily"" ! No mention closing time! At 21.40, Was surprised they were about to close and did only one way from Habour tower to sentosa!!"
so so so so not worth it. the title says it all.free pins and masks wont even cover for the price.should have ust taken the bus or mrt or cab going to sentosa which would have saved me money and time. there's even no view to see.totally not worth it.
Went to Clarke quay singapore Monday night had to pay 85singapore dollars for 3 glasses of wine and they charged 28 dollars for a glass of champagne what a rip off people beware the bars at Clarke quay They send youngsters to serve you so you cannot check up be aware send these rip off people broke
"Cable car ride awesome, but to let customers wait for a short but very expensive ride for more than half an hour to purchase tickets is very un-Singaporean. Saturday just before noon, only two desks open out of six. Singapore, pull up your socks, it is not only money, try the old service again!"
"Looked everywhere on their website to find out how much the short ride from Harbourfront to Mount Faber was and all they had was the entire ride to Sentosa. Got to Harbourfront and was put off by the long queue. So walked up to Mount Faber to have lunch. On the way back, we decided to take the cable car back to Harbourfront. Asked at the ticket booth and was told one way or return same price $26. Get off at Harbourfront or Sentosa also same price $26. Why don't they be more upfront with such information and state this fact on their website? Unfortunately, this is the typical unyielding, inflexible system that is rife in this country. It seems that what the consumers want matters absolute squat to these people. Nice way to run a tourist attraction!"
"The worst spent Â£29 in our entire lives... yes that is how much it cost to transport two people across to Sentosa island in what was a 10 minute journey!! What's more is we only wanted to get a single but they only sell a return ticket! It's a nice view yes, but if we knew the price before hand we would never have considered it! The view is not worth that at all! Whats more is you can only get to the cable car by taxi... so that cost us another Â£10 on top! all in all a very expensive morning before we had even arrived at the island. Would HIGHLY recommend taking the metro which is Â£1.50 each or walk for only 50p (takes about 30 mins)... if only we had known this beforehand."
"We were at Mt.Faber on 19th July 2012 .. To begin with, there was no parking faciity whatseoever.....only valet parking (which I got to know about too late!). There were limited directions on where to purchase the cable car tickets....the valets (who were very friendly) asked us to go upstairs - the cablecar attendants guided us to shop front on Level 2 - who in turn asked to go back downstairs just behind the valets parking counter !The guy at the ticket counter was a disinterested bloke...possibly bored that there were hardly any visitors....atleast when we took the ride. We were forced to buy return journey (via cable car) tickets at $$29/pax. They do NOT sell one-way cable car tickets! Did I tell you that they also give you free drink (sugar water) and some angry bird masks!While the cable car ride by itself is good, the management should consider a $15/pax - one way option.Go for the ride only if you have small kids.... There are other places from where you would have a better (and prettier) view of the Singapore!"
"My brother (8) and I (12) went on the Cable Cars today from Sentosa Island to the mainland and were extremely bored. There really wasn't anything to see except for trees and a construction site. The ride was too short and a complete ripoff. It cost S $52, whereas a cab cost only S $10. My dad says that it was the same price as our lunch. On our way back, we had to get off in some building on the Harbor front and STILL had to take a cab back. My advice? Steer clear of the Singapore Cable cars and head for a taxi stop."
"I was so looking forward to going on this, went all the way to the Harbour Front to find that it is closed until some time in Q2 this year. No date given. i can only rate this as terrible as I could not go on it and the information about it being closed and when it was re opening again was not very good when I got to the ticket desk.I would recommend this on the basis that seeing the span between start and end point, the views and the ride would be great."
"Great experience and value for money considering the great view, good food and excellent services provided!Only downside is the time, 2 rounds of flyers is an hour for 4 course meal. 2 course per round, 1st round was sufficient but second round is a bit too tight for the main course and dessert. Not everyone eats that fast though and ended up rushing through the meal."
"Wished the weather could have been better, didnt wait for long and had a pleasant ride. Souvenir shops have quite a wide range of items too for everyone."
One of the most enjoyable activities in the city. Best to take a good camera as you can get photos of areas you cannot normally photograph well. Overall good and would recommend.
"This will be the 3rd time I am taking Singapore Flyer. But the view still takes my breath away.Seriously speaking, if you are visiting Singapore, please2x make sure you take this ride as well. The highest point at 165m, you get to see our city area and residential areas.It is a breathtaking 30minute ride. I would recommend that you take it in the day first as the view is awesome but if u only have a choice of the evening ride, it is more romantic - u can see our city simply lights up!I share with you photos I had taken."
"Breathtaking and amazing views of Singapore, must go on the flyer. Worth it.. It revolves very slowly, so good for anyone."
"After living in Singapore for several years and doing most tourist attractions two to three or more time, my ten-year-old daughter and I finally tried the Singapore Flyer. Well, it's just blissful at the moment - a bit sad but blissful. The pandemic has reduced crowds significantly at such tourist attractions so while I wish them better times ahead, but for now I enjoy the tranquility they offer. This is your usual slow moving mega Ferris wheel but wow, the views and the opportunity to experience an entire 'pod' with just your family. Memorable and a real treat. We loved it - just wished they would have let us go around twice."
"Well it's better than what it used to be, third time and less crowd during the weekday. But you don't feel the one hour"
"This is certainly a must if you visit Singapore, don't miss this unique experience. You should plan some few hours for this attraction."
It is a very popular attraction with a plenty of options! You can do a ride or dine in! I like it both! Its a very beautiful place with the marina bay view!Amazing view during evenings!Food is delicious and staff are very friendly!Cheers!
Pretty nice views and wonderful experience. You may observe Marina Bay and Singapore from different angles. I like ferries wheels and this one will be one of my best ferries wheels' memories.
You have to book your seats.. and You must Visit This flyer..There is Restaurant after the entrance on level 1Singapore eye shows you the whole city from a Eagle View.You can see the roads the infrastructure the waterbodies by just standing in the glass cubical.Its TOTALLY CLEAR GLASS .. there are seats to sit but nobody prefers to sit as such..
We both enjoyed the Flyer for 30 minutes ride. The places visible were beautiful around at night. We can see the city and harbor from different angles. This place is worth a visit.
"Really amazing experience, you are like in the top of the highest peack in Singapore.I love it to try it and try it again."
"This was an amazing experience, it provides a great perspective on the city of it's size and the buildings. I would highly recommend the experience."
"Once in a lifetime experience. if you are afraid of heights will please do try, but once you inside . Hmm The best ever!"
Best place ever! Singapore was awesome place.... I will come again together with my family next time. Peaceful place...
The Singapore Flyer offers amazing views of MBS and the Marina Square precinct. Perfect family activity as you spin slowly. Lots of laughs - especially at Mum's expenses as her fear of heights kicks in
Great of the City. Very nice night view of the city. Got the VIP cabin package with Singapore Sling served while enjoying the scenery.
"To have the breath taking views of Singapore, one must go on the flyer. Worth every penny spent. It revolves very slowly, so even kids or elders won't be scared at all. Best time to visit is evening."
Its just like the very famous London Eye. Very affordable but global experience. The city vie is panoramic. Better to visit in night time. The shopping arcade attached is also worth visiting. Dont forget to take your photo clicked but its bit costly.
"Trust me, it looks prettier when you saw it with your own eyes. Singapore city is beautiful, highly recommend if you try it with night view"
Whether you want to ride it or just look at it from a distance (does make the city skyline interesting) you get to see a lot from the wheel and it is a nice place to chill out in an air con glass pod.
"This was awesome. The view is amazing, breath taking and well worth doing. You can see 360 degree views of Singapore including Merlion Park and Singapore River, Great photo opportunity of city."
"2nd highest in the world after the one in US, excellent view from the top of the entire city . Worth the visit ."
"Cheap, clean, smart, efficient facilities and driverless trains covering most of the city. Compare and contrast the London Underground."
I have been lucky enough to visit a few Flyers in the World and the Singapore one is magnificent and the best I have ever been on - go in the evening when it is getting dark as the views of the city are amazing and the Marina Bay Sands and Gardens are next door so you can see these all lit up. This is by far better than the London Eye which is world famous and you have a lot of room to walk around and take photos. I am not a great lover of heights but this did not bother me at all. As is everything in Singapore this attraction is very well organised and you have little time to wait. There is a visitors centre nearby with local food and drinks for visitors to try out before or after.
"We took a ride on the flyer and were not disappointed. The views of the city are amazing. It wasn't particularly busy when we visited and so we had no wait, and an entire 'pod' to ourselves. It was a great way to orient ourselves on the first day in Singapore."
It is just so beautiful.Check the light show which occurs mar lion side and opposite site( marina bay sands side)Highly recommended
The Lion was interesting and a lot bigger than it looked when you get up close. It was easy to get to and there were a lot of local school kids there. It seems to be an important icon to the people of Singapore.
"Although we had our doubts about the VIP edition for the Singapore Flyer, we enjoyed the experience hugely. There was very little waiting to board the big wheel, and the champagne not only eased any anxiety over the height and duration, but also heightened the exhilaration over the sights. It was also nice to be able to sit down whenever we wanted and to have more space to move about. Our group of four shared a capsule with only a group of two (with a bottle of good champagne for each group). Visitors should schedule their visit for sunset if possible."
What an experience! Worth the time and money spent. You get to see the whole city. Felt safe at all times. Best time to do this is late afternoon / early evening as the lights change the city to a spectacle!
Visited the Singapore flyer a few times because it is always beautiful to view the scenery from the flyer. It takes you 30 mins to finish the entire ride and go during evening or before sunset is the most.
"My friend from the US stayed in the Hotel Ritz Carlton which is very close to the spot. The cabin is very spacious and feel comfortable! You can see the 360 degree full view of the bay area which is amazing! Great experience for travelers even for me as a local Singapore! The ticket is worth the price. When I go, not many people maybe it is weekdays. Waiting time is just few minutes. It was afternoon time and the sunshine was a bit strong. Maybe the evening time would be even better with nicer view. Staff is friendly and direction is very clear. The staff was very kind and willing to hold camera and take photos for us. Great training and service attitude. The place is kids friendly if you kids are ok with the height. Will come again with my guests from other country!"
"We've lived in Singapore for over 7 years now but we visited the flyer only in 2019 when guests came. Though we already know what an architectural marvel Singapore is, the panoramic views from the flyer make this ride worth it. We timed it to go up at twilight and come down after dark. It is quiet and peaceful as compared to views from other places and Singapore looks stunning in the night lights.My only wish is that it was a tad longer at 45 minutes."
We enjoyed a fantastic view from the flyer as well as the wide window panes and low moving paste. There was no queue after sunset and everything went smooth.
"Located close to other attractions such as the helix bridge, the Marina bay sands, the merlion and so on.A single capsule can accommodate a group of 8+ people. It helps to be friendly with strangers so that you can take pictures of each other.The ride is pretty slow and lasts for about 30 minutes. A voice recording that provides information about the flyer and its surroundings plays in the cabin.Overall, a must-do activity in Singapore."
"We went up about ten in the evening and the views were absolutely beautiful. We wanted to take the girls up again but in daylight this visit, sadly the Flyer is out of action this time"
"Great views of Singapore.Good value for money and well worth a visit.Well organised, with good facilities."
The ride takes about 25 to 30 minutes. It's like riding an elevator with floor to ceiling glass. It's an enclosed capsule and it's air conditioned. It's the highest of its kind around the world and it gives great views of practically the entire country and even Malaysia. What I particularly like about it is that there's an audio commentary that you can choose to use during the ride. It narrates about the different places in Singapore and even gives trivia about these places that I was surprised to hear about.
"The Giant Flyer will take you up in the sky, giving you an amazing view of the city.Since it's moving slow you could click some good pictures. Also there will be audio assistance with map, which helps you to get an idea of places around the Flyer.Evenings will be perfect as you get to see the setting sun and the busy evening streets. Good for a ""ONCE"" in your lifetime experience."
On the day we were to go on the Flyer they closed it due to a Thunder Storm and possible lightning. So we returned the next day and had a Pod all to ourselves (4 people).It was like a private booking at no extra cost.Well worth the cost.
"We did not pre book this, just turned up on the day, it was fairly quiet and we had the pod to ourselves, the views are amazing and plenty of information about various landmarks, well worth doing on your visit."
By night it is a spectacle to see the view from the top. The full circle takes around 45 minutes and is a great attraction. The carriages have 4 iPad sized screens that help pick the landmarks you see.
"Definitely recommend visiting the Flyer we were lucky to only have a total of 4 in our pod so we had great views, the pods can take around 28 people so they can get quite packed."
This is another 'must do' in Singapore. It is spectacular breathtaking view! Conditioned cabin holds up to 15 people.
"Certainly is worth while visiting; however do check its operating before you leave. I went twice and it was working, due to 'technical difficulties'.You can get the train here easily enough."
The Flyer Second largest in the world provides you a glimpse of the beautiful Garden City Singapore.
"Got a breathtaking view of the Singapore Skyline and the night vision is to die for! We did the Flyer by 7p and the Flyer gives a 360 view of the whole city. The glass covered capsule had a long wide bench which allowed 2 or 3 families to sit and gaze out at the beautiful lights. However, no one missed any opportunity to click selfies and shots with a grand background of the SIN Skyline. Lighting is very dim in the capsule so camera shots had to be timed and angled to get a good in-capsule capture."
"A little pricey but in all a delightful, comfortable, stunning ride full of views of this stunningly beautiful City. It's a very enjoyable long, slow ride."
Ride the Singapore Flyer at night for a spectacular night view of Singapore.Absolutely a must if you are visiting Singapore for the 1st time or a return visitor that has not been on this before.The staff are very friendly and attentive so it was just a really enjoyable time.
"A must visit place for all the tourists. The flyer moves at very slow speed and is comfortable for all the ages. We get fantastic view of all important places of Singapore. The capsule in which we sit is so big , you can freely move and take photos of you and family in all angles without any fear. Suggest all tourists to enjoy this flyer without missing . It takes 35 -40 minutes for one complete rotation. Cost is about 59 SGD, but worth it."
"I went on the Singapore Flyer in October 2019. It was a lot of fun. I paid $33 SGD for my ticket. I went in the morning on a Saturday when it was less crowded. I also took a taxi there to save time. From the Singapore Flyer you have spectacular views of Marina Bay, the Sands, Gardens by the Bay, Merlion, Saint Andrew's Cathedral, the Fullerton Hotel, the Singapore skyline and many other things. It was really an enjoyable experience and worth the money. I recommend taking a taxi there and from there as it is a bit far from the nearest MRT stations and it is too hot and humid to walk."
"Very good and in our view we got the best view of Singapore from the top, s must on a nightime however as the lights are amazing"
"Singapore flyer is an experience in its own way....cute capsules just swallow you and take you higher and higher ....where you can view Singapore from the TOP - Awesome View...Not to be missed.One precaution, as the capsules of Flyer, does not stop, just slow down for you to get in...Senior citizens and children need to take care"
"Sunday 20th October and we took a trip on the Flyer which is Asia's largest giant observation wheel.The fare was 33 $SD each, roughly Â£19 each, the fare for children was 21$SDThe ride takes about 40 minutes and at its highest point the pod reaches 165 metres above the ground.From our Pod we got a 360 degree view of Singapore's landmarks and points of interest. This included:-The amazing Gardens by the Bay's with the Supertrees, Merlion spouting water at Merlion Park, the iconic Marina Bay Sands.Additionally there was the unusual shaped building, Theatres on the Bay, known as 'The Durian', The National Stadium, National Gallery Singapore Supreme Court and recognisable by its dome. We also saw part of the Formula 1 race circuit.In the distance we could see the Marina Barrage.Throughout the adventure there was an audio commentary pointing out places of interest and providing historical, cultural and useful information.It was not very busy when we visited so there were only 3 other people travelling in the Pod with us, so we all were able to move about freely."
"A must experience. Simply awesome. A day time view of Singapore is simply amazing.Kids enjoy it a lot. Very few cities have a flyer, but they all are different in their aspect."
I took this ride at night time and it wasn;t very busy we had 4 other people with us in our carriage. Seeing it at night really highlights the main attractions and we actually watched the gardens night show while we were up there. It is extremely high and I couldn't really stand and walk around like others could so I sat the whole ride and took it in. You have to do it even if you are afraid of heights it really showcases the night beauty of singapore.
Don't miss to see the beauty of Singapore. When you are inside the cable you will see the panoramic majesty of Singapore. Must visit this place if you are going to visit this country.
"The Singapore Flyer is really fantastic! It is impressive! And, it is a great way to get a birds eye view of Singapore. Fly away!"
Great time on the flyer.I'm very scared of heights so sat down for the whole rotation.Great experience and even better when you get off there is an excellent ice cream stall Gelatissimo... low sugar chocolate was a real treat for me!
"At night, you can see a great night view and feel the tech of massive Flyer when it slowly rotating. I wish to visit again at the daytime."
Its a great experience and great views of Singapore from the POD.Sit back and relax. Go mid week when less people.
"It is around 30 min ride , ample time for you to enjoy the night scenery, it is worth the queue. definitely a good way to enjoy the nights scenery of singapore and show friends from overseas to have that experience"
"Half our trip for around $30. Great views over city, Marina Sands and Gardens By the Bay. Worth every cent."
This is really great value for money. The views are as amazing as you would expect. We visited during the day and could literally see for miles. As with most popular tourist attractions I'd recommend arriving early to avoid the queues. The entire circuit takes about 30 minutes so the time spent here will depend on how long you queue for before boarding. We arrived at about 10:30am and walked straight on! Well worth a visit.
Went here at night to get a view of Singapore's city lights. Truly mesmerizing. It was a 20 to 30 minute ride. Comfy and spacious. This one is an instagramable must visit.I thought that the Marina Bay sands view deck was high... Wait till you ride this one. This one is the highest!
This is a great way to enjoy the sights from above of the modern city of Singapore and enjoy a wonderful meal at the same time. Don't miss this experience.
"its a 30 minutes ride for a single rotation ride. pretty high that it covers a 45 kms radius view on a clean sky day. in the nights, it is a pretty breathtaking view with all the glitzy lights of the city in view. worthy it"
"Went at night for a different experience. Ride took around 30 minutes long. There was a queue when we went but it moved pretty fast. Once at the top, views of the Singapore skyline are breathtaking, especially at night with all the city lights. Nice to know that you could actually book a capsule and have dinner with friends/family while admiring the Singapore skyline"
My wife and I found this a really enjoyable experience.Fabulous views and very we'll organised.When we arrived in Sentosa island which has a bit of everything we made are way to the Shang gri la Hotel for lunch a very enjoyable day.
"When we visited it was very quiet and got straight on. This gave some amazing views of the city, particularly of the gardens and Marina Bay."
This is very similar to London Eye...giving a good bird's-eye view of important landmarks of Singapore. IT takes about 45 minutes to go around once...giving us ample time to take pictures and view the beautiful structures of Singapore
"We booked Singapore flyer tickets. Great place to take some selfies and family pics. It's a very slow ride with scenic views of Singapore, Gardens by the bay, Marina Bay etc and you don't feel a thing. Would recommend it highly. I don't have fear of heights but my kid has but she was just fine in the flyer,she had fun too."
"I was really scared of this, but it is really stable up high. I would have loved to do it at night.Great views all around, with commentary too.We had the pod to ourselves, it takes 30 mins to go all the way around"
As number of tourists are more they surely can reduce price and benefit in having more viewers. It has 2 seperate class of dining as well. Evening dinning on the cable is really wonderful.
Don't buy your tickets in advance as it's easy on the day. Get there early before the tours arrive. We had a pod for just the 2 of us. FantasticViews great. Commentary helpful. Pick a good clear day. It stops if there are storms aboutDay I'd probably better than night as you can see so much moreA definite when in Singapore. Most big bus routes stop there and MRT station close by
"Picked up from our hotel Village Hotel Bugis by City Tour coach with the ""Spiderman"" guide on board with his hilarious comments. Reached the site of boarding point. The slow moving giant wheel in the lines of London Eye was enchanting. The ride of about half an hour was a delightful view point of Singapore. This can accommodate at any given time about 750 people."
"Went to this place on a weekday, coz I was informed the cue is long during weekends. Better if you visit this place during sunset or early evening, so that you could have the best of both worlds, sunset, and SG starting to glow up because of the lights. Very comfortable ride. Temperature inside is cold considering the humidity in SG. Accommodating staff. A must try."
"Great views over the city, if possible go during the day and night as you get to see Singapore city in different ways"
"Had a few days in Singapore went on the Flyer which gave great views of Singapore. It was not busy as midweek, we bought our ticket when we turned up. If you show your Singapore Airline boarding pass get 10% discount. Lovely garden and fish ponds underneath the Flyer."
"I chose to visit the Singapore Flyer on day one of my trip and it was an exceptional way to start, with the city laid out at my feet. There is a gift shop as well as food stalls directly below the flyer."
"We went on the Singapore Flyer to see the sights. You get a brilliant view of the Grand Prix pits, Singapore Straights, Gardens by the Bay, Marina Sands and the many different architectural styles across the skyline.The pods are spacious with good seating although you'll probably be standing all around the pod looking at all the sights."
"Its a 30 Min Journey in the Flyer, You can enjoy a full View of Singapore Sitting in the Flyer. You can even opt for Sling Shot of Champagne in the Flyer Cabin."
We couldn't believe how perfect was the city from there. Perfect view but a little bit expensive. It is ok for once.
"Best time to ride is just before dusk, to see the metamorphosis of the skyline in the changing light. This is certainly a must see!"
Nice experience and 30 min is well spent...evening is also good choice of time of wanted to see lights of Singapore.
Must visit a place and wroth time spending. Lovely view from the top of stunning Singapore. Suggested time to go to this place is the Evening where you can see city skyline.
Singapore Flyer was a great way to see views of Singapore. The rotation commentary and digital guide on board helped identify and give more information on prominent landmarks.
"Wonderful way to see the city! It's only 30 minutes and the views are fantastic! Nice gift shop as well. Saw a few things there that I never saw again anywhere else.... since this was day one, I didn't buy anything. It's a regret : ("
"We didnt expect to enjoy this as much as we did, they views are amazing and give a great overview of the city. we visited during the day and would probably have visited in the evening if we had thought about it, A good place to see the light show at the gardens on the bay if you time it right."
"I visited the flyer just as daylight was fading, and couldn't have timed it better. To see the aerial view change from day through to night was unbelievable, and was astounded at just how far could be seen. Not inexpensive, but definitely a must visit if in Singapore"
"Just ourselves and another couple took the Champagne and Chocolate flight, it's a great way to see the city from a different viewpoint!"
"Took the Hop-On/Hop-Off bus to The Flyer around midday on Tuesday and NO LINE UPS. Straight onto a pod with 4 other people (pods take up to 28) and provide an excellent 1/2 hour viewing of much of the key areas of Singapore, so you can choose whether to walk or ride or bus to next thing you choose to explore. Well worth the cost and 30 minutes time well spent."
"If there's only one thing you want to do in Singapore, I'd recommend taking the Singapore Flyer. Our Singaporean friend recommended that we go at dusk and true enough, we got to witness views that were really fantastic!"
"Do not miss this attraction. The Singapore Flyer is the 2nd largest Ferris Wheel in the world. It offers a great view at the sky line of Singapore, the Marina Bay Sands, the bay, the garden by the bay an others. One trip takes about 40 minutes. It is worth the money."
"This is a MUST when visiting Singapore !Incredible experience and you can see EVERYTHING !!It really is an amazing experience.There is also an interactive tablet inside the pod so when you are going around you can pick different locations on the tablet and it gives you some information on the things you can see around you, I thought this was a nice touch so you can identify everything and get some history/ facts.The Singapore Grand Prix race track is right under this. So you can also visit this once you have had a ride on the flyer.I have included some photos from inside the pod."
"The Singapore Flyer is a must see attraction, breathtaking views of the City. It's $33 dollars per person, but it's worth every cent."
We went to on the flyer at 7pm so it was just getting dark and was quite dark by the time we reached the top. The views are magical and we took some great photos. Never felt unsafe at all. The ride is so smooth and enjoyable.
"Great way to see the Singapore financial and social center. Very smooth ride and they did not overcrowd the capsules. While the line seemed long, it moved quickly.Well worth the trip!"
"The Flyer and a trip to Sentosa are mandatory for any visitor to Singapore.Expensive but worth the cost.On the several times that I have taken the Flyer for visiting friends and relatives, I have had no wait and have enjoyed the experience. Staff is helpful."
They have a lot of eateries and you can spend the whole day here relaxing. Take the flyer and enjoy the ride as well as the views at different angles. It's a great place to spend the time with the family.
We did this to get a good look at Singapore and it was good. 30 mins all up to do a circuit with some info on the sights
"Since its pandemic season, its understandable that less activities, such as stores and eateries sites are in operation on site.However, the capsule journey was a sight to behold and experience.Beautiful panoramic view of the Singapore skyline was breathtaking.The kids certainly enjoyed their moments, fidgeting their camera phones taking pictures for memoirs.The gift shop offers wide variety of souvenirs to choose from.Setback is the accessibility of public transportation which might take you quite a walking distance to reach its lobby.However, plus point is that, it is wheelchair-bound friendly and that means physical disability guests may still be able to experience the ride."
Good way to see city. Take your camera as it has nice views not normally to be ahieved. The organization was a little confused at times but overall a nice experience.
"We decided to visit the flyer after having stayed in Singapore for 2 years already. It was casual for a couples date, but the experience was pretty much as expected."
"The Singapore Flyer is one of the world's largest observation wheel at a height of 165m. From the top, you can see views of Marina Bay Sands as well as the rest of the city and out to sea.We thought it was a great experience to do while in Singapore and worth the cost."
"Good to go for once, offered lovely view but bit pricyRecommend to board flyer around 6:45 pm to enjoy day and night view"
"Singapore flyer is a must visit place in Singapore. It is highly recommended for photo loving people. From here you can see the whole Singapore and the view is amazing. However it is very slow so you will not fell when you reached the top and when the bottom. But you will get a beautiful view from here, you can see the the gardens of bay , the ocean, a football court, the whole Singapore and so much more."
The fee may be pricey. But you need to try it out at least once. It has the 360 view and you can see most part of Singapore.
"This was quite an experience, although after a while, I had seen enough and wanted it to hurry up. It wasn't bad, quite the contrary - but it is the scenery that makes this attraction, not the excitement of the ride IMO. I went when there was no line or perhaps only ten to twenty people in front of me, so the wait was nothing to speak of.The views are spectacular and I recommend this."
I have visited the flyers in every city and this one is no different. The city is great and clean and gives you a great view of the city
"The singapore flyer was a treat for the eye but but, refrain going to the attraction during the day time as Singapore's relatively a hot country. Sun Ray's were shining on our shades though. The capsules are Airconditioned however it was hot.But the view was spectacular with no doubts."
We visited in the afternoon and were lucky that the flyer was pretty quiet. We were able to have a whole pod to ourselves (don't think the attendant was too happy about it - why not if there's no one there?).The views were fantastic. We got engaged in the Cloud Forest during our trip to Singapore so it was great to see the dome from a higher angle. It was also very cool being the only two people up there and not having to worry about views being blocked.
It did feel like a good experience in the start of being in the flyer. However due to the extreme slow speed it started to get boring. Looking at the lit flyer from the ground is as good an experience too.
"The hype of the place is amazing but it doesn't live up to its hype, I would definitely suggest to spend on other things than the flyer."
"Great view overseeing singapore city skyline. Very beautiful view to see and take photos with beautiful highway. Quite Pricy though. My advice is to choose either one, MBS sky deck or S' Flyer. If you have gone up with one, you can forget about the other. But recently when I went there, it was close, so do check out before heading there."
"Wanted to take a ride up on the Flyer but unfortunately it was closed for maintenance when I visited. Would have seen impressive views of the city, which I was able to get as well from the Skydeck at MBS. Impressive structure and usually very popular with visitors."
"Had an enjoyable time on flyer not so much the ride but for the sightseeing and looking over the city.Worth the money in the end, I would definitely go at night as Singapore at night time is sensational."
"Merlion (lion head with mermaid body) is one of most popular tourist attraction. Great photo shoot but so many people fighting for best spot. You need to walk about 10 minutes to get there under scorching sun, bring your hat or umbrella and water if you plan to stay a bit longer"
Fun experience and a must visit if you don't have high altitude claustrophobic feelings. It's slow and steady so you get used to the height. The views are amazing and the lights at night fascinating. Must must visit especially if you are with family.
"Attended Singapore F1 GP as official and my station/position was very close to the Flyer which was unfortunately closed /not operating as it is beside the race circuit and pedestrian traffic was ""allowed"" during specific times... CERTAILY was imposing feature and had time permitted would certainly have ridden on it. am sure the view would have been spectacular over the city and bay area... maybe next time !!"
"If you wish to get the beautifully lit view of the city , go to Singapore flyer around 7:30 PM. Grab you tickets and sit back to see the Marina bay light show at one side and the different colours sparkling at gardens by the bay on the other."
"On clear sunny day, well worth the excursion to the top to see superb views of Singapore and beyond. Definitely add to list of things to see and do"
"The ticket was expensive for a 30 minutes ride. The view was fantastic. You can get many good photos from here of the Garden by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands Hotel, Fullerton Hotel, etc. Otherwise, nothing much. They also take a picture of your group before entering, but you can refuse it. We did as we know we weren't going to buy the picture! It's not cheap."
Good view from the flyer. Visited during night time. Have perfect night view of Singapore. Walking distance to the Sand hotel and river cruise. Nice experience for my kid.
We have a very smooth ride on the flyer. The gondola is very big and can accomodate for up to 15-20 people . very nice view from the top .
Singapore Eye also know as Singapore Flyer is basically a big giant wheel with multiple capsules which can hold around 10-15 tourists at a given point of time and this wheel rotates at a very slow speed which allows you to view complete Singapore from a height. If your planning to go tho this country its a must to ride. But if you really want to enjoy the lighting view of this country from this flyer u must take this ride in the evening.
"The view from the Singapore flyer is very nice but go there when the weather is good (sunny and no haze) otherwise you will not see Indonesia and Malaysia. The pace is very slow so enough time to look around, personally I believe it could have been a bit faster. Great to visit with elderly people."
I think you will have better views of the city from the observation deck from Marina Bay Sands but this is ok too
The view is great and it is worth going with families and children. But once is good enough as it is the same.
"Very nice view of whole city from all angles,must see,very good tourist destination ,you can enjoy scenic Singapore in day or night,must visit"
"More than great views, you have all the fabulous buildings from another perspective. Free with the Singapore Stopover Holidays. There are so many great things to do here, though, prioritising is a must. I think equally good views are acheived on a cruise."
"During a short stay in Singapore, my fiancÃ© and I visited the Singapore Flyer.We had a good day to see the landmarks of Singapore on our first day in the city. Although the day was slightly hazy, the views were amazing.Nice spacious cabins, and lucky for us air conditioned:) The entire rotation takes about 30 minutes, and you get breathtaking views of all of Singapore's amazing landmarks. The narration that plays during the trip is informative, and helps you understand the significance of each of the landmarks, gives insight into the history of the city and there are also touch screens if you want to learn more about the things you are seeing.A great way of seeing a 360 view of the city and a must do when in Singapore."
It is a great place to garner good views of the Singapore skyline. You would not even feel the movement as it is very very slow. Kids after a while get bored as a whole round takes 20 to 22 mins. Overall a one time enjoyable experience
"This is a great way of having a view of the many Singapore land marks. You can pay more for a private pod and to have champagne, but the basic one is fine and goes over just long enough to enjoy the birds eye view without becoming bored."
"Recommend this experience and also go for the Singapore Sling trip. Slowly and calm you are taken on a ""flying"" trip with numerous of views over Singapore downtown. Night trip is nice with all the lights of cityWe loved it...."
Well worth the money. We went at night and it goes around slowly so you get a good look at Singapore by night.
About a 5 minutes walk from the MRT.This landmark is a must visit if you are in Singapore for the first time. Great views of all the surroundings.It would have been better if Singapore had produced a clearer day but it was a sunny day if a little hazy still.
"Went for a ride, and what a ride.Unbelievable views and commentary as you go to pick out landmarks.Get photo opportunities."
"Air Conditioned Flyer cabin can accommodate around 10-12 people, one round will take around 30 miniatures to complete, you can see the Singapore most of places when its go highest position, you can take beautiful photos all around, nice experience to be have in Singapore at the reasonable price,"
"good views, we did this during F1 race so we could see the whole race track from aerial view. was super."
"This is my second trip to Singapore, really do love this city and especially when night falls, the city really and literally lights up. A marvel and the Singapore Flyer will only enhance this experience. Reason I'm a star short; don't go when it's raining or drizzling. Your view will be obscured and your pics and selfies won't be great.Will be back again Singapore."
Visited the place during day.Day visit has the advantage of zero rush as well as less number of people per enclosure.The view is simply mesmerizing as one gains height. All landmarks of Singapore are clearly visible.The whole process takes approximately 30 minutes.Air conditioned enclosure with glass all around are simply a must do in Singapore
Get a ticket and experience a full scene of the city from the flyer. You gotta see the whole city from the top. It takes about 15 to 20 mins for the complete thing to get over. Good one!
"A few of its kind are there in the world n this one is closest! Visiting in daytime makes more sense if weather is ok. Do book a meal online or at times discounted prices available on-site. Travel by public transportation may take up lot of time, located near merlion gardens by the bay! May walk down."
Wonderful way to see Singapore from above at slow pace. Very scenic views at low reasonable cost. Well worth the time & money.
It's a good activity which can be completed within one hour. There are seats inside if you can't stand. Most of the time people were taking pictures through the glass of the city.
Singapore flyer is a great view from 47 stories high. a wonderful experince and a must do when visiting Singapore
"Holy batman!! This aerial view of the city, at a height no man should ever go, was a shock to my system lol my fear of heights kicked into high gear on this magnificent ride. My husband loved it!! He got some amazing photos that we would never have gotten other wise. If you are ok with heights this is a must do in Singapore."
Went on the Singapore flyer in the evening during the grand prix and it's inaccessible unless you have a ticket for the F1 so we just walked on without having to queue. Also there were only 8 people in the capsule so plenty of room to see the great view of Marina Bay.The ride lasted about half an hour and moves so slowly you can't tell you're moving.I'm not very good with heights so the first part of the ride going up was quite nerve racking but I enjoyed the second half of the ride more and the view is better on this side of the flyer.The most annoying part of the ride is the constant commentary and screen telling you about Singapore. It doesn't correlate with the ride so is pretty pointless really.Otherwise it's a great experience and not too expensive.
"This was lovely. We did this at night. And the view is amazing. Many options to choose from, can do dining in cars, or have drinks etc. eas definitely worth it."
"We had read reviews recommending early evening as tthe best time to visit however we were keen to avoid queues and decided to go early morning instead. There were no queues at the time and as it was a clear day, the views were fantastic. We shared our ""car"" with 3 other parties however there is lots of space so not jostling to take in the views or to get photos. No, it's not cheap but it's not bad value as the flyer moves very slowly although I can't remember how long we were on for - certainly long enough to get lots of photos. The cars are comfortable with seating and air conditioning. It's located close to the F1 building, Marina Bay Sands and Helix bridge so you can fit in lots of other attractions before / afterwards."
This is our first experience on the flyer. It was good plenty of room for kids tp run around. Its a ferris wheel don't know what more to say. If you are looki mng a place to see the Singapore city view and dont mind spending SG33 its a good option.
This is the Singapore version of the London Eye. It's pretty nice. It was raining when I was there so I didn't get quite the view that I would have otherwise. But you can see the harbor and the gardens pretty easily.
We really looked forward to this having done large ferris wheels like this in London and Brisbane but our luck was not with us as it was so smokey and hazy from fires burning in Malaysia.Wish they offered a discount ticket for the days the view is not good.
"Not the fault of Singapore but the haze from the fires from neighbouring states somewhat destroyed the experience, but the pods were clean tidy and spacious and the view over the Grand Prix track was great."
"The air conditioned pods are a real joy after the humidity of the day. A great view even with the dullness of the haze hanging over Singapore. Although not as high as the London Eye this is a must do to get a great view and good pictures. The price is comparable to the observation deck at the Marina Bay Sands and the good news is that you can take pictures of this iconic structure from the flyer as well as capture images of the gardens, and the skyline.We were lucky enough to get a pod for the 3 of us, I am not sure how often that happens but it did allow us to take as many photos and see as much as we wanted."
"Until recently this was the world's tallest observation wheel. Carriages are very large holding up to 12 people. We were there in late August and were the only people in the carriage so we didn't have to push past others to take in the stunning views. Carriages move very slowly, I believe it took about 30 minutes for a single revolution. You can easily pick out many of Singapore's landmarks including Gardens by the Bay, the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome, the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Singapore F1 motor racing track."
really good experience.. go with family.. you can see nice singapore business view.. sea view & other many building with nice view.. bank & business building..
"You can see Singapore all around; Port, Marina Bay,roof of Cloud forest, etching. If the sun shines opportunity for good photography. It takes full 30 minutes for the flyer to go one full circle."
We went on the Flyer on our first day in Singapore and found it a good experience. Not badly priced either which is always good. Goes around very slowly and although this is good for picture and video opportunities by the time you get half way around we was ready to get off
An excellent way to see the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and surrounding area. The bird and skyline were tremendous
"As with other wheels, this is an easy 30 minute changing view of Singas. It is especially enjoyable when your spouse suffers from vertigo so for those 30 minutes you can have a wry smile as you do the loop and for a change they quietly sit there gently freaking out. An absolute please during our Singapore stop over. Wish I had one at home."
I have done this twice now. ONce to celebrate my sister's 50th we got the champagne car to ourselves - this is a private car with champagne music and chocolate strawberriesthe 2nd time was the cocktail private car for my daughter's birthday!both were very excited and enjoyed the private car and drinks!
We picked just the right time to go on the Flyer. We went up when it was day time but on the way down the sun had set and it was dark. Spectacular sites of the main tourist attractions and the Marina Bay Gardens of course.They really need to improve the sign posting from the MRT station though as it doesn't continue once you leave the station and in the heat you don't want to be walking without really knowing if you can get to it
"We rode it at night to see the lights of Sinagpore. The ride lasts about a half hour and is as smooth as silk. Bring your camera and enjoy! When you want an activity that's unique, try this: Singapore has more than malls, museums and gardens. I wonder how many couples become engaged on the ride."
"We had the Singapore flyer listed as one of our 'must dos' whilst here, I can't say we was disappointed but I wasn't enthralled. The views are great but the ride is slow and once we'd reached 1/4 of the way round we were ready to get off. It might be more impressive at night with all the lights or better with a drink/food but I felt I saw just as much from a local sky bar with a drink at the cost of â¬26 dollars each whereas the flyer was â¬33 each with nothing."
"Went on the Singapore flyer for the views over the city and surrounds, great views easy access. Went at about 11am, no lines and no fuss. A must visit when in Singapore"
"I am really afraid about heights and I suffer from vertigo, but the stall are very wide and you can sit quietly without problems. I liked very much the tour and the landscape from there!"
"The Singapore Flyer is very similar to the London Eye, we did a special package where you get to drink a Singapore Sling during the 30 minute ride. To get to the Singapore Flyer is not that easy, it would be great if there were more signs or even painted directions on the footpath. We thought we would be able to walk from the Gardens by the Bay to the Singapore Flyer but it is too far, you have to get back on the MRT and then it is at least a 10 minute walk from the closest MRT stop. There are plenty of taxis out the front if you want an alternative way to go home."
"Cannot complain about the view or experience. Magnificent. My only thought is that it is overpriced, as are many things in Singapore. 40 minute flight for $33 ??"
An occasion to celebrate and remember with the family and their partners. Food was excellent and the staff were all friendly and efficient. Two rounds was a bit rushed for the full dinner course. Three rotations would have been perfect.
People who hate of heights are comfortable as it travels very slow. The view is amazing as we can see the city. A great experience.
We visited in August and it wasn't all that crowded. Pretty expensive for what you get but that's Singapore. The views and interactive touchscreens were nice as was the commentary in the capsule. Worth a ride.
It is more expensive to book with a sling and the sling is very weak and not to be compared with the one they serve in the Raffles Hotel but I even preferred it as I'm not too keen on alcohol/gin. It's not as good for a full view of Singapore as the 1-altitude either but it is still a great experience. You can move around the cabin and there were even snacks offered (although they were very spicy!). You don't have to queue up though and its a great service. It is also nice to see the flyer at night from inside the cabin with all the lights on. A very relaxing experience.
"This offered good views of Singapore but to be honest, I think that going to the top of one of the many available towers which means that you get the best view for the whole time and perhaps get refreshments. Also, getting into the pods can be a little risky especially for elderly people. Some staff are lovely but the one getting people in and out of the pods was a bit 'precious'/jobsworth but not very helpful."
"The Singapore flyer is one of the main touristy things to do in Singapore. From my experience, I'd say if short of time, you can either do the skydeck at Marina Bay Sands or this and not necessarily both since you get amazing views whichever one you choose."
"Impressive, with fantastic views of Singapore. Popular but waiting not long. Worth the visit and highly recommended."
Nice 30 minute ride with great views of Singapore . A bit pricey with 33 and 21 sgd tix for adult and kids but worth it . Went on a weekday and almost end of school holiday so no queue as well .
"It is an interesting expreience to go on the flier to see Singapore from above. Pity you cannot buy the tickets online - but the queues to buy the tickets an board the flight wasn't bad at all, took less than 5 minitues altogether.The commentary given as you ride was pretty good as it gives informations about what to see from at various directions as well as some history of Singapore.The price was a bit too much for what you get."
"Had a layover in Singapore on my way to India. Stopped at the Singapore Flyer - Ferris wheel. The 360 views of Singapore are breathtaking. The tube you travel in on the Ferris wheel has air conditioning. Great selfie and scenery picture taking moments.The only reason this attraction was not 5 stars is the very long walk and confusing entrance to the ride. This could be better signed and a more direct way could be helpful when it is so blazing hot outside.Otherwise, the sights and ride are worth the price of admission. Enjoy!"
"We were excited to go on the Singapore flyer after learning it was the largest Ferris wheel in the world! We caught the MRT to Pomerade station, and then had lunch just outside the flyer. We waited till it was around 6.30 then bought tickets and went up to the second level. Luckily the lines were fast moving and we didn't have to wait long. Once on we were able to see the sun set and the light come on for the night show, it's a 30min rotation so plenty of time to soak in the sights of the city. The ticket is a little bit expensive but worth it for the experience!"
Another good place to visit in Singapore. The ticket is quiet costly but it is a one time experience to get in one of the highest flyer with a height of 165 Meters. It will take 35 minutes to complete the ride
Perfect way to see Singapore in air conditioned pods.... can see all the sights without the walk. It takes about 30-45 mins to go around
Singapore flyer is a giant observation wheel at singapore it takes almost 30 min for one round at the top of the wheel we could also see malasiya and indonesia.It is one of the great constructions in singapore
Worth a trip when you are here in Singapore. No line to wait and great views from the wheelMight be worth buying tickets beforehand on Internet yo save time
It was a nice experience being up in the air and seeing the beautiful city from that viewpoint. I suppose you getting to enjoy a supposed peaceful night also depends on your luck with your 'capsule-mates'We were unfortunately with families with very noisy and rowdy children running around and screaming so it was pretty difficult to fully appreciate the view.
"We did this during the daytime, which was a great way to see the islands that lay outside of Singapore. We also got to see the F1 track and the view across the city. Well worth doing."
A wonderful experience to life. You must have this and night time much better than the day. There's a value for money
I have tried this twice with my family the first time was a bit boring cause we went in the day time but the second time we went it was at night and the view was amazing.
"A very nice trip, it felt safe and comfortable, and the views were, of course, breathtaking. Recommended!"
Singapore Flyer is a must visit place when you are in Marina Bay sands. Around 10 minutes walk from Marina and easily can commute by MRT. It costs 33 Singapore Dollar per person and takes around 30 minutes to complete a cycle. Wonderful experience and view from the flyer is awesome.
"Our third time on the flyer, this time with a young child. We went mid week and mid day, which was quiet and we had a capsule to ourselves. It's a nice, quiet, relaxing ride in lovely air conditioning which is nice after being out in the hot humid weather.It is more spectacular at night but we enjoyed the views in the daytime too."
"Great views of Singapore City. Very smooth ride, doesn't feel like your moving at all. Worth seeing day and night!"
The best of the region on the birds eye view of singapore and as far as Indonesia..One time will enough to blow you away.
"Great view of the Central Business District and of Singapore skyline in general makes the high price worth it. During the month of Singapore National Day, a promotion makes it a steal for senior locals in possession of a PAssion card, at just S$1.90 per ticket."
"During July we went to Singapore and Indonesia.Singapore is an amazing place to stay, and the Singapore Flyer is brilliant, it is a bit bigger than the London eye and better set up. The views are fabulous, we went during the day but I think an evening fly would be better, to see Gardens by the Bay at night from there would be amazing.Would recommend if you are there."
The view was fantastic and the air condition was also nice. The weather was also perfect so that we can see far. So Its a must try!!! thank you.
"Is it that due to mechanical issue that I could not go in? At night illumination, remains city symbol."
"When we visited in February, the Flyer was closed. Apparently it is have mechanical problems. However you still see it and it is lit at night. Even if you can't ride it, it still remains a symbol for the city."
Mesmiring view of the city must do. Capules are realy clean tidy view of city is beautifully view in morning time
Its wheel adds yet more eye catching beauty to the skyline even if rotation is not currently part of its abilities.
"We went on the Singapore flyer in the afternoon. its nice and cool inside, but it felt like a trap as I was stuck in a confined area with my toddler for 40 min! Not so suitable for young children as it can be quite boring..."
All the hype about this Flyer - I real life this is just small one compared to many in the world. Do not waste your money!
Usually heights don't bother me but it was a quiet day at the Flyer and they asked if I would mind going in a pod by myself. I said no and thought I was lucky to get one all to myself but as soon as the doors shut I had a bit of a panic. I got some great photos (when I could let go of the bench) but I don't think it was a significantly better view than from the top of MBS. It's certainly something to do if you have time but not one I'd say is in the top 10 for Singapore even if there were other people in the pod.
"I visited quite late in the evening. If I recall correctly, the ticket booth was not clearly signposted, and the building around the flyer looked like it needed some refurbishment. Good views, but nothing spectacular especially considering the cost of the ticket. The souvenir shop was underwhelming, which meant I saved some money.It might be worthwhile if you are stuck for something to do for an hour though, but I wouldn't make it top of any to-do list."
"Look at it but do not ride it - you can summarize this * another Ferris wheel * that is becoming more common in the world. Sure the view from here is breathtaking, but you have at least twenty more places in town you get at least as nice a view ... Absolutely no 'must' but you get what you pay for. However, as a photo object, the 'wheel' can have its value - beautifully illuminated even in the evening."
A lovely way to view the city at night looks amazing at night as well when all lit up. Only downside is it's a bit of a walk to the gardens by the bay and the surrounding area so wear comfy shoes if you intend to visit the area by foot
"Yeah - went on this one evening - absolutely great views on the 30 minute revolution - but was annoyed by the constant ""advertising"" over the speaker system. I would have liked just mood music or plain silence."
"We visited past the flyer. Thought of going there but was told that its not worth going. Most of the time found it stationary, thought what is heard is true. Didn't miss much I suppose as visited the London Eye."
Very slow with great views. Did not enjoy this much compared to other things to do in Singapore.....
"Just a typical observational wheel. The Flight Experience attraction also lies there'¦ so two attractions, one place!"
"Wheel goes up, wheel comes down. Nothing here that can't be seen from a hundred other high-rises that dot our CBD for a fraction of the price.A must-visit if you like big wheels that turn at the speed of continental drift."
A scenic view of the bay and the surroundings. It was nice and enjoyable but I felt it was a bit expensive for what it was.
Singapore flyer is like a merry go round gong at a very small speed. One can see a good panaromic view of the city after reaching the top. According to me the experience going on top of Marina bay sands is much better.
"This is definitely an eye catching attraction. I dont think it's really worth the high admission cost, however. If you like ferris wheels and observation decks, give it a go, otherwise, give it a pass.Weirdly, the view at night wasnt too great, as the windows seemed foggy and there was a lot of glare.Staff were very friendly and helpful. Lots of other little shops and attractions are also on site."
We went in afternoon but I think to go when it's dark will be nicer especially if you time it for the light show in the Gardens by the Bay. I think if you want a birds eye view of Singapore the Marina Bay Skypark might be better
"Children are always excited to go on the eye but really if you've been up once, there's really nothing much to be upbeat about cos scenery remains the same and sometimes you do wish that you could have something else to look forward to when on board ... but it's always an adventure for kids! Good for tourists though to see SG on a different perspective but i do feel that the price could be cheaper!"
Relaxing moment to enjoy the surrounding view. Can use the time to have some quiz on SG. Take a short break from the busy schedule and hustle of the city.
"Maybe I'm bias, but I don't love ferris wheels/flyers as a way to see a city. There's much better views available from the many bars and restaurants atop Marina Bay Sands, however with that said the Singapore Flyer is quite a novel way to see the city. It takes about 40 minutes to go around, so make sure you're ready to be locked in a bubble for that amount of time.With all that said, it was a great way to see the start of the F1 Grand Prix race, but those spots are quite limited."
Just an average ride on this SIngapore flyer. You get a good view of the city. Quite comfortable but i dont let having too many people sqeezed into the same cabin. Dont even have a seat for me during the 40 minutes ride
"We went to this flyer and the view from up there is beautiful, However, the ride is about 40 mins and it can get quite boring after some time."
"We did the Flyer one weekend evening around 5:30. We had read that it was more crowded later, but even when we left the area after walking the grounds, there was only a few people waiting in line. We had four in our family, and had a pod all to ourselves, which was great for seeing everything. That said, the view isn't as good as others in the area (Marina Bay Sands, Level 33, etc) and it is quite expensive for a half hour ride."
"A lot of Singapore attractions are based on the views you can get from them, the higher the better. Singapore Flyer was expensive and not easy to get to - and offered a view I had already seen.I have done the Vegas High Roller, and I will be doing the London Eye next month, so I guess I keep going to giant ferris wheels -- that said, its not a necessity. If you can get a sweet bargain, go ahead, but it's a long walk from public transport and usually a long wait in line, and its a 45 minute ride. I don't regret doing it - but I wouldn't have regretted skipping it and saving the time/money either."
Nice view but a bit over-priced for what you get. Similar to the view from the Marina Bay Sands hotel.
"The view from up high was lovely, but one can still enjoy it from any bar restaurant on a high floor in a sky scraper, for eg. level 33 bar & restaurant or Marina Bay Sands hotel bars in levels 55 & 57. I found the informational videos about Singapore places to visit on the Singapore flyer quite interesting though."
"Singapore flyer lets you view the top of city hall where you can have a majestic view of the whole area. This ferris wheel concept is very modern and family friendly, however the pricing is abit high. So i would recommend to buy the tickets when its on sale or discounted."
"Flyer is average according to me. Very slow and not so thrilling. In total 30mins , we all feel bored withing 15mins. If you want to say that you travelled in Flyer,just go."
"If you want to see the Singapore cityscape, this is the place to be. Just know that besides the Ferris wheel, there's really nothing else to do there. Another great place to see the cityscape would be marina bay sands. But that's way more pricey."
"a good experience, but too slow. One circle takes 30 minutes to complete. Would prefer MBS Skypark to have better look of the city."
"It was expensive for what it was. I guess there are options to visit it with champagne and the like, but the standard is a ferris wheel with view over the coast, the Sands and the city.We were there on a day with no waiting line, which was good.The best part was grabbing icecream at the store right outside of the main building"
This flyer offers a lovely view of the city from all angles. It was lovely to see it all lit up at night. Its one of those tourist things that seem to be a must do when you are visiting Singapore.
Post completing Garden by the Bay we directly headed to Singapore Flyer in the evening as it was 1 km from there. We entered Singapore flyer at 8 pm and wanted to see Singapore in the night. It was good experience however just worth once.
"Singapore is beautifulThe Singapore Flyer is Nice but, Expensive for what it isI would rather take a helecopter flight if it was available"
"Nice location and view. Especially as you enter the city.But nothing that you'd amiss, considering all other places in the city that you could visit and spend time."
"It's something my travelling companion wanted to do so we went up and we came down. I noticed as we were entering the attraction, there was a flight simulator at a reasonable rate but couldn't find on the way out. Anyway, Singapore Flyer:Done."
"The Singapore Flyer is a very large ferris wheel, similar to the London Eye and the Orlando Eye in Florida. We went during the day and maybe it is more enjoyable at night. We felt it went far too slow and the price was high."
"The Flyer has all the elements to make for a 5-rating review, but failed to deliver on two elements: (1) Our car was so cold that the windows covered with condensation on the outside half way through the trip so that we could no longer take photos of the city. (2) We purchased a premium entry package with a Singapore Sling, and it was absolutely awful. Just disgustingly sweet cherry juice with no detectable alcohol. You will do better just to get a regular ticket. At least then you can have a 4-rating experience because you won't have to deduct for the drink."
"I took a first-time visitor to the Singapore Flyer, confirming the actual experience of riding it is worthwhile. My experience of getting to the flyer, however, left me hot and annoyed and the disinterest of the young staff in my comments about the lack of signage didn't improve the situation. The website instructions say to travel to Promenade Station, take exit A and follow the blue signs for a 5 minute walk. I could not spot any signs and although the flyer is visible, a construction site blocks the view of which direction to access it from. On arrival we followed the sign to what we believed would be the ticket booth and entrance, only to find that the ticket booth was the floor below and the other side of the building to the flyer entrance. There seemed to be no logic in this location as it was neither near the carpark or foot traffic. If the flyer site hadn't been so isolated from other attractions I would happily have walked away at that point."
"Not bad, avoid on a rainy day as you cant see anything on the outside from inside.Even after the rain has stopped. Avoid the Flyer at night , not worth it."
"We purchased a package off the Klook app and unfortunately got ripped off. It was for the Singapore Flyer, the Domes at the Gardens by the Bay and the Skywalk at Gardens by the Bay.We needed to collect the tickets from someone at the time we booked the flyer and he gave us an envelope containing the tickets for all of it. We checked all 3 were there then were ushered onto the flyer. When we went to redeem my ticket at the Skywalk it was a childs ticket (only typed on the back and doesn't stand out). I ended up not being allowed on the Skywalk and to date Klook have been difficult to deal with and haven't accepted my email with childs ticket photo (claiming they can't open it, when I emailed it to my other email addresses and have no problems). When we were at the Skywalk someone else had the exact same thing happen from Klook as well.The Flyer was a nice slow ride and had great commentary about history and sights to look at. It was airconditioned and had seats in the middle you could sit on.Great for nice photos of Marina Bay Sands, The Gardens by the Bay and the city."
"You cannot miss the view of the 'Flyer"" on your left as you near the city from the airport and it looks like most 'wheels' but probably a little bigger.It does provide good views over Marina Reservoir and the city skyline but so do many other points in Singapore.Of course it is lit up at night like they all are.Unless you like swinging through the air in a small capsule walk the streets and see tne history."
"This would probably have been a more amazing experience if i hadn't yet seen the views from marina bay sands. Definitely a good way to see the city from above, but doesn't really differenciate from the sights you see from the marina bay sands rooftop, so i'd choose between these two instead of doing them both. A nice ride can't deny that."
"Been here many times , honest review is a bit feel boring when ur inside the capsule not worth it , which is expensive to get there"
"This is a giant Ferris wheel from where one can get some spectacular views of Singapore. Getting on these giant Ferris wheels like London flyer, and other such wheels in other countries is rather touristy and these tour operators trap you easily.Unfortunately there are so many ways of getting spectacular views of Singapore that spending one hot hour in the queue and again spending one more hour on top is a bit boring.Possibly having a ride at night to see the Singapore lights must be more attractive."
Not so impressed with the ride. Yes it is done well but boring after awhile. There are better ways to take in the magnificent views of Singapore. Do it once for sure.
"I didn't like it personally . Wheel moves like a earth warm , it will give you 360 view though of singapore. No from my side ."
Not sure how they manage but actually Flyer is much smaller than in pictures so we just looked from outside and did not try it as we had already full day with other activities. But I must admit that it looks very good during night time.
"The flyer was immaculately clean, very quiet and provided beautiful views of Singapore. The staff were very helpful and friendly.. It was easy to get tickets, no difficulty in getting in & out. The hop on hop off buses drop you just outside."
"The overall experience was just ok. Had much more expectation from the Flyer, but its just give you a city view same as Marina bay sands. Nothing new and I would choose Marina Bay sands any day for the city view considering the cost involved as well. You can give it a miss if you are going for a short stay and dont have time in hand."
i am a stingy traveler. the ride i am sure is spectacular but there are other ways to see singapore vista. i advise you just take a selfie with this gigantic ferris wheel without riding it :)
"If you guys are a group, you might love it but I went alone was not interesting as it takes a long time the cues"
"We enjoyed the flyer - but there are lots of rival alternatives if you want a top down view of the city.We went early morning, and there was no queue. There didn't seem to be an MRT nearby, but we were able to get a bus direct there. Although it said the capsules hold 28 people, there were only around half a dozen in ours because it was a quiet time of day.But here's the issue. At $34 per adult, it's comparable with other high rise views around the world. But there's loads of competition. We preferred the One Altitude rooftop bar, for instance, which offered similar views - and at $35 came with two rounds of cocktails. Even the Marina Bay Sands Hotel bar is cheaper.And although it's a shorter building, the terrace on top of the Art Gallery also offers outstanding views.So - although we enjoyed the Flyer - I think I'd actually recommend you give it a miss."
Like the London Eye but not as much to see. You do see the Grand Prix stands and hotels and the two rivers.
"A little spendy but comparable to others at $33/pp. No better view than what you get at MBS or another highrise rooftop. TIP: If staying at MBS, no need to do this. Their roof is better."
"It's an interesting concept to allow visitors to have a birds eye view of the city, similar to cities like London. Go if you're in the vicinity after visiting Gardens by the Bay, or having watched a concert/musical at The Esplanade...and would like to cap the evening off with a view of the city.Ideal if you have the whole capsule to yourselves (they do offer private dining in the capsule for you and your partner but that will set you back by at least S$1000....you make 2 revolutions for a 4 course dinner) but we weren't so lucky in that we were in a capsule with a noisy tour group on both occasions we were at The FlyerIf you're looking for a good view of the city, there are other locations to consider"
"Singapore skyline is certainly wonderful, especially at the sunset. The ride is however so slow that can become boring. Having 20 people per capsule also ruin the atmosphere. Suggest to board around 6.45/7 to catch the best of day and night"
This is something like london eye. Not like must visit place in singapore but you can visit this place to have a birds eye view of singapore
The flyer takes 30 minutes to complete one rotation. The flyer provided good views of the marina and city skyline. Another option to see the skyline is to go to the top of marina bay sands on the 57 floor. The price of the elevator ride provides a credit $20 towards a bar drink. We had the delicious Singapore sling. The marina bay is only a few minutes from the flyer
While on the Flyer it STOPPED really scary and had happened few times. Will think twice before buying ticket to FLYER
"It's an ok but not wow experience. A bit slow and takes around 40 minutes to finish the lap. Amazing view of city skyline and famous attractions, specially at night. Yet, the Skypark, I think that's the name of the three towers connected by a roof top park and pool, for it provides the same view, in addition to you moving around several areas of the attraction, instead of staying trapped in the glass compartment of the Flyer."
"Its quite pricey for a 30 mins ride. Although you can see Singapore skyline, it didnt gave me an awesome feeling. Quite a disappointment"
"This was the final excursion on our 5 country honeymoon tour, really memorable evening. I remember seeing the F1 track from the flyer, must he amazing on race days. Can't remember what I paid but definately should be on your list of things to do in Singapore"
"The actual ride itself was great, and the Singapore sling delicious. We had our own pod that was decked out with plush seating and nibbles. The reason I am deducting rating points is due to the lead up. It was difficult to find where to collect tickets, and we were told to come to Guest Services to wait for an escort to the ride at 1.45. Over thirty minutes later we were still waiting for the escort. With an impatient five year old this is just not acceptable. They should tell people to come to Guest Services at the correct pick up time. It was just not organized at all."
We did the Singapore flyer with children all less than 6 and we realised that it could have be skipped .They have huge lines (our wait was 45 mins ) and they don't allow you to give food to the kids while waiting . Maybe they don't want the mess .
"We pay $33 for adults and $21 for kids.The ride last for almost 30minutes, quite a boring experience for the kids (and for adults frankly).We definitely enjoy the cable car more."
"It's okay, not the most fantastic view of Singapore, and it takes awhile to get around maybe 30 minutes but at least you get your money's worth"
"If you love to go on a ferris wheel and enjoy the view of the bay area, then you must go for this.Personally I preferred to go on marina bay skypark due to some reasons,i.e., no time limit on stay and you won't be closed in a capsule.Rest is your choice and according to your itinerary you select anything."
Definitely recommend doing this at night to enjoy the city and harbour lights.The boarding cues are hidden which reminded me of Theme Parks around the world. Over 1hr lined up before actual 30min trip.Edge pod is air conditioned so it was a very pleasant time.
Overall experience was pretty okay. The entire round takes about 30-40 minutes and gives you a great view. Do try to visit during evening or night time.
"I find this place boring.When i entered the places, not much crowd/queue was there in weekend's afternoon. ticket costed 33$ per adult. I find this expensive as the flyer itself is not so much interesting. I would recommend to visit Marina Sand Bays hotel top floor that Singapore flyer."
"Unfortunately, we lost the ability to romance the Singapore Skyscape because of two young, extremely loud and inconsiderate Chinese females who spent the entire ride yelling unbearably into their mobile phones in Mandarin. Sadly for us, we couldn't open the door and take the quick way down. The whole trip up and down was great for photo opportunities but, in hindsight, you get exactly the same view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands Skywalk."
"Not being a fan of heights perhaps I should not write this review. It was OK but would certainly not be a ""must do"" for me."
"The view from above is spectacular. Everyone should try. People with motion sickness, dizziness on heights etc. can also try as the speed is too slow ."
Everything was ok. The ride is maintained well and the view is splendid. However it takes just 40minutes and im not sure if it is worth the price
"Had to walk quite a way to get to it , windows were steamed up with the humidity so restrictive of being able to take photos ,does give you a good feel of the vast area and buildings , not sure if it's worth the 30 s dollars"
Fine once you're on the wheel but the surrounding facilities were lacking. Once on the wheel it takes about half an hour to go round and it's very clean inside each pod. Overall recommended.
"We enjoyed the Singapore Flyer, but it certainly wasn't the highlight of our trip. It provides great views of the Marina Bay area and the surrounding harbor."
"I will preface this review with ""I don't like heights!"" so the first thing I did was sit down and hold on. Why did I do it? Singapore Flyer has great views on Singapore, the harbour, the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay etc etc. We easily entered a huge glass encased capsule after a short wait in line. There were three of us and another Chinese family of 8. I will say only that the whole family were all loud, argumentative and aggressive when it came to seats and standing in front of people trying to look at the view. Not much you can do about it except enjoy yourself otherwise. And I did enjoy the view from the relative safety of my seat, even when we were going over the top of the ferris wheel so high in the sky with seemingly only a few metal spikes holding us up - what was I thinking!!! For those who are height-a-phobes, sit still, hold on, and enjoy the experience, its is a good one in hindsight."
The flyer Moves too slowly..u won't even feel that it's moving...u can enjoy the Singapore from top anx it's amazing big buildings ...
It gives a good view but it's very slow. You kinda feel bored after a certain point to be just sitting inside
"Once you are up - it is AMAZING! But getting up was such a saga. We made three visits and each time they were closed due to bad weather... yet some people seemed to be allowed on. We even rang their customer service line and asked if they were open, they said yes, yet were closed when we arrived 10 minutes later and told us they had been closed for more than an hour. We eventually worked out that if you purchased your tickets on your phone, they let you through - even if the ticket desk was closed! It's a great attraction but be aware of the organisation, very unlike Singapore."
"I think it is has been made a BIG HYPE. There is really nothing spectacular to spend SGD 33 per person for this unless you have been to a developed country for the first time. I would instead prefer to hire a bicycle or a battery operated cycle to roam around Marina Bay and explore the beauty. Well, it is an individual's choice at the end of the day."
"This is a good way to get to and around Santosa island. For those of us who don't like heights it's a nightmare. However, if you can open your eyes the views are great. A very smooth cable car."
Nothing much to see. Inside is spacious and air con. Have seats for elderly to sit down. Half of it you can see the skyscrapers of Singapore the other half is basically nothing. U can go for it if u got a deal but not a must do in Singapore.
Too slow as it rotates at a slower pace than expected. Overall I felt there were more interesting things to do if one is in Singapore for 2-3 days
"Just a warning. This place is designed for people who go there by tour coaches.For those going from the MRT, it's a so-near-yet-so-far experience because of the bad signage. It gets worse when it is a hot day and you have kids in tow and you just wonder if you are going the wrong way. The escalator at the side of car park that leads to the overhead bridge to the Singapore Flyer building has no signs so I won't be surprised if many people end up jaywalking instead. And even if you use the overhead bridge, you will reach level 2, and then you realise that you have to walk a big round to reach the escalator that goes to level 1.There are no seating area at the taxi area, and also hardly any seats for anyone who wants to take a rest without buying a drink. There are also no seats when queuing, which adds on to the bad experience especially when the queue is long."
"Visited flyer while in Singapore. Decided to go evening to see lights over the city, unfortunately there was a lot of others with same idea. Really crowded, first queue to tickets and just at the counter they say that an additional hour for getting in the wheel! That is not really good service. Only one ticket counter. The tour itself quite nice thus getting in same car with ADHD Chinese disturbing the experience. If you visit there pre book your tickets and consider pay little extra to get private car"
"As wheels go this one has a nice view over the Kallang river and the city centre of tall building and historical places. At night its clearly a very colourful array of lights and during the day often a good viewing point to see the city centre (financial centre) and what is left of Tanjong pagar container Harbour. Another key aspect here is your in the middle of the F1 race course, so you can see the boxes or Pits during the period other than the race. It takes just under 30 mins to do the round. The facilities are ok but other than the view not much here."
"It has fantastic views, but waiting in the queue to get on, and then the slow pace of the flier itself makes it seem you are using a big part of your day. Also fairly expensive, but wat in Singapore is not?"
"You get an amazing view of the gardens by the bay/dome, the city and Marina Bay Sands. The cabin is big and equipped with with AC. The ride takes about 25mins to complete and moves very slowly. Ticket price was S$33 which I thought was a bit too much."
"More space, not atrociously priced and great views of the city like most of the other eyes. Takes a lot longer for one revolution so plenty of time for photos. But would only recommend it if you are on a romantic trip or want to fascinate your kids by the engineering marvel that it is. Otherwise there are plenty of place to get great views of Singapore."
"Maybe Ferris wheels aren't my thing, but standing around a slow-moving capsule as you see the same sights as a rooftop bar isn't my thing. Pick a rooftop bar instead. Also, due to the glass design, females should avoid wearing short skirts unless they wish to show off."
"If you have visited similar places in other countries you cn give it a skip. Its overall 30 40 min ride. You grt good view of bay and merlion and the city but its slow and you tend to get bored. Also the temp control is not low so it does become a little,warm. With 33Sgd ...it is fairly expensive. If first timer pls do take else skip"
"The place is well maintain. Exciting, but only for the 1st 10min.. after that, boring.. to long....."
This was our third time visiting and I must say it was still an opener. We went in the late afternoon and the crowd was ok. Not a long q to go up and inside the cabin was also comfortable number of people.I would say the experience on the flyer itself is still wonderful and enjoyable.But the food court was getting from bad to worse. It used to be filled with many people and all shops were opened. But now less than half the shop are operating and barely any people there. I am not sure how to describe it but the surrounding shops and restaurants just doesn't have the mixed vibe to suit the flyer.There is koi pond directly under the flyer where you can purchase fish food to feed the koi.
i think better to the the ride in the day than night because you can see much more & further during the day.
"Obviously the views are amazing the ride lasts for 1/2 hr but $80 for 2 adults and a 4 yr old, it's a bit steep. At least our 1 yr old was free."
Flyer maybe good for tourist. kinda boring. suggest to visit ones is more than enough unless they add more to make it more interesting
"A simply extraordinary display of zero empathy and zero responsibility of a known issue with their third party booking system.Bought two adults and a child from an approved third party. Received confirmation after payment some time ago, only to be told at the ticket checkin that because the third party hasn't sent the children's ticket (for whatever reason) - despite a receipt and email stating payment and ticket confirmation - staff refused to let us in. End of story. No solution. No assistance. Just 'no'. It was juvenile.We were there for my daughter's 5th birthday celebration who was wondering - literally in tears - why the staff were being nice to everyone else and letting them in except us. Even a child could see the horrendous handling of this by the undertrained and hopeless staff.One particularly terrible employee who we initially spoke to - before I asked her to walk away - was a demonstration in entitlement and childish arrogance. Her attitude was woeful and her immediate unwillingness to assist us in any way was bizarre at best. I believe her name was Farah and management should pop her in a back office as far away from customers as possible.The young male trainee - the only one with any sense of customer service who actually apologising for the issue we were facing - stated this has happened before and the previous customers tried the international number 'relentlessly' to try and resolve the issue when presented with the same doe-eyed stupidity. An issue which SHOULD have been acknowledged, addressed and resolved by the staff rather than providing us a clinic in short sightedness and idiocy.It took four staff - FOUR - before someone finally came down to attempt to resolve the issue - taking every detail of the purchase down to the point of ridiculous - when we we're finally able to board. By then nearly 30 minutes had passed and dozens of guests had been through ahead of us; the damage was done and our daughter was beside herself, so the entire experience was a complete waste of time and money.Awful staff management, zero demonstration of genuine customer service or lateral thinking, and an entire experience absolutely ruined for our daughter's 5th birthday.Your staff and management should be ashamed of themselves."
"Like all ""eye""s of the world, it was boring and no value for money. Way better of going to the top of MBS to catch the same view (if not better). SAve your money, and give it a skip."
"This is an overpriced eyesore. At worst it's a vain attempt to copy British technology without any regard to functionality and popularity, at best it's an expensive accoutrement to buttress Singapore's skyline. It adds a geometric dimension to the MBS structure. As a tourist draw it's a failure. Who wants to spend more than an hour on an expensive Ferris wheel. You can get better views at a cheaper price with a drink or meal included.The facility has broken down several times leaving riders stranded. And the poor hawkers on the ground level don't get much traffic. Not one of our proudest monuments."
"It's currently broken...but either way it's a really long thing to do. Personally, I lost interest in the view but was still stuck in the flyer for another 30 minutes. It's a nice view, but I'd just go to Marina Sands for that"
"it is one of the attractions a major city needs to have, but if you can avoid it, just go somewhere else."
"I visited the flyer on a Tuesday night with relatives from overseas and had to wait 1.5hrs before I was able to board the flyer. Our queue was Long and at times not moving at all and I soon realised it was because of large groups of corporate guests (people with tags and special arrangements in the cabins such as wine) who were allowed to jump the queue and bypass the normal guests to board the flyer first. I counted a total of 12 large groups who cut the queue and were allowed to board the flyer first the moment they arrive. Thus, our regular queue was moving at a snail's pace (and along corridors that was stuffy and warm). This is unacceptable. I have taken the flyer numerous times and I have never had to wait 1.5hrs for a flight before. Everyone is a paying guest, why are some guests given more consideration than the rest?"
"its outdated,just turning up & down.nothing extra.there are better attractions & this one is a waste of time"
"For those going there, take yr meals before stepping into this place. When they just started, there are many food varies to choose, after so many years, the eatery place are so deserted and charge costly, eg. a plate of fried noodles cost 3 dollars at residential, 4.5 at food court (mall) and here they charge 6.50. The taste, quality and quantity does not justify the pricing. The place seems worn down and total spending time approx an hour (ride plus queuing for the tickets)"
The views were okay and they just don't do justice with the entry fee. I'd suggest you to drop this and better go on Marina Sands viewing deck for much better views.
The views seen up from here can be seen from anywhere and hence don't see a profit in wasting 30 dollar per person . Actually it's going in loss and the Govt might soon close thsi attraction as no one pays to go up there except few tourist
"If you have a goal to be on each flyer in each capital city, then this is a good reason to step on.If you like to have a view of Singapore, I know better places . It is a highlight of the city, but I would not dare for it."
"View of city skyline and areas around Marina Bay Sands. Taken twice - day and night. Preferred night view. Frankly Singapore Flyer is nothing to rave about with its many man-made structures if you have been to the London Eye with bird's eye views of historical landmarks of the beautiful Thames River, Buckingham Palace, Parliament House."
It was initially exciting for the kids but they quickly got antsy. Luckily cabs are big and roomy... But really not worth spending 30 minutes on this if you have many other activities on the plate.
Get a view of the entire city. But gets boring after the first few minutes. There is nothing to do and you want the ride to end.
"You might have as good of a view in many other places in Singapore, and at least without beeing stuck for 45 minutes in a cabin where there is nothing much to do. I find it pricey for the ride, and you might even have to queue at the entrance for quite a long time."
"While starting the ride you will feel a bit excited, but once you are there, theres is nothing special except at the highest point, when you get to see the bay. There are too much of iron architecture blocking your view."
food and service was not good and there were some technical problems with the ride. I would not recommend this experience when there are so many other wonderful things to do in Singapore.
"I've had the ability to get on a few of these around the world, this one is not only the most expensive, but also one of the most uninspiring, feel free to go if you have nothing better to do and are willing to throw $50+ per person"
"I've been here 3 times.. but the last time, when me and my parents went there, when i want to exchange the ticket i already bought online, the staff not so friendly!!! When i said NOT i mean it.. which im a foreigner, if i need help or confused about the ticket, the staff in the cashier need to explain and more patient and nice to us... now i didnt want to go there again... You should asked ur staff to learn how to service people (specially tourist and foreigner) more nice and patient, because we PAY and a bit pricey too.."
It seems that by now people know that there isnt much to see and do at the Singapore Flyer. There was no queue at all to go in but the price was still too high for what we got: a quick tour (30'?) on the wheel with decent views of Singapore. Recommended if you have kids that are begging for it or if you are really bored otherwise nothing special.
"you get a view of the city and on a clear day, a distance into the heartland of the island. but it is not a spectacular view. it's cheaper and takes a lot less time than this very slow moving ferris wheel if you simply google the pictures. i wouldnt waste my time doing this again."
"This was an obligatory tourist attraction for me on my stay in Singapore. I am willing to overpay for lots of things to try them once, but this was not worth it. At $33 per person you get to ride the extremely slow ferris wheel for about half an hour. Best part was when it was over. There are some good views when you get to the top of the ride, but you can get similar views with better angles for much cheaper in other parts of the city. Thankfully I did not have to wait in a long queue to board or I would have been really unhappy with the wasted time. Spend your money on some other funner things in the city."
It's my 2nd time in singapore so the first agenda is to ride the flyer but to out surprise the flyer is closed due to technical issue :(The place looks deserted only people there are the people that doesn't know that the flyer is closed included us.
"For me, the ride were just too short and not worth it comparing the money I have to pay. I visited singapore 3 times in my life, I enjoyed everything except this one..."
"This was the biggest disappointment of our two week anniversary trip between Singapore, Bali and Taipei.My first activity I wanted to experience and share our special moment was with Singapore Flyer, and that never took place. Two weeks before our trip I received an automated e-mail stating due to technical difficulties the Flyer was not operational. We were given the option to immediately cancel or wait. As this was once in a lifetime trip, I was hopeful and waited. Three days later a second e-mail informing me the Flyer would likely not be operational and they would process a refund. IF YOU BOOK IN ADVANCE, YOU PAY AT TIME OF BOOKING. I have no issue with that to secure special events such as dinner or slings on board. When they cancel, you are informed refunds take 6 to 8 WEEKS. Unacceptable. Airlines refund quicker than this and they are notorious for cancellations.When we arrived in Singapore we learned more about the technical difficulties from locals. We also were informed management has changed in recent years and more ""technical difficulties"" have occurred where the Flyer is not operational. Two different tour operators told us they have recommended against bookings as this has become more recent with financial issues. Initially I would have thought ""that's just tour operators steering visitors to other things."" Then we visited the Singapore Flyer grounds. It was deserted, on a weekend afternoon less than 10 people we saw around the sprawling area of the Flyer. There has to be some validity if everyone is keeping away, and it's a shame. I always thought of the Flyer as an icon of Singapore. Yes, it's still lit at night and that's beautiful (hence 2 star and not 1). There is no timeline to get the Flyer operational, instead the same message is repeated on technical difficulties. If that's the case, be transparent and don't process refunds in 6 to 8 weeks. If guests are required to pay up front for bookings, finances should be in order to reimburse.Overall, extremely disappointed."
I when to this place on 5th of March however the flyer are close. Not a good day for us but we still enjoy the experience there.
The Singapore Flyer was out of action during our recent visit to Singapore for technical reasons. The flashing lights on it at night from a distance appeared to be moving but in fact it did not move for the whole week of our stay!
"Unless you have lots of time and money, the Flyer, is not a TOP choice. It's slow, expensive and the view can been seen from many buildings.I would pass."
"We came here to have a walk round the promenade etc. Well the actual promenade was closed and there was literally nothing at all to see here, except for the flyer. It's also around a 10 minute walk once you get off the MRT. Not too bad but unless you want to go on the flyer, don't bother going."
"33 SGD is way too high for this ""OK"" ride.The flyer is definitely hyped.I would prefer the Marina Bay Sands Skydeck."
"I wasn't too impressed with the Singapore flyer, it's around $30 dollars and the staff will allow you on even if a place to sit isn't available.The views you get are incredible and you have plenty of time to capture the moments.I do believe it takes a little too long to go around but that could be due to safety measures and the amount of space it covers.All in all it is a good experience but just a little timely.What I would recommend is to go during the night as everything is lit."
It is no wonder why the Flyer got into financial trouble. You travel inch by inch around the wheel and see the same view over and over again. You can get a great view for an entire day if you just check into any of the good hotels nearby. Skip this.
You can get better view from other places than wasting time n money here.it use to be great attraction till the IR came.now you may want to go to the sky deck of marina Bay Sands for a splendid view.kids under six years may enjoy the flyer.its a half an hour slow ride.
"I just dont think it's worth it. The view is so-so, the interior inside is so-so. Maybe will be better if you book the romantic dinner."
"Don't waste your money got to the zoo, water world or night/river safari instead you'll get your monies worth then. Pretty but not worth going on. You can see the same view and pay for a hotel for the night for the same price if not cheaper."
"It is a very big flyer with expensive ticket.Although it has view to most parts of the city,but it is not exciting at all and is very boring."
Found this experience very expensive and not worth the money. We also had screaming children running around which did not enhance our experience in any way.
A huge circular structure turning so slowly that you don't feel it's moving. You can have a nice view of the Singapore skyline but do it only if you have time with nothing else to do!
"We were excited to do this attraction as we had heard you get fantastic views of Singapore. Whilst this is true, we were a little disappointed with the experience. We had expected to have some information inside the pods themselves about what you are looking at, focal points etc but there was nothing. We thought perhaps there would have been an audio talk suggesting which side to look out of and what you could see but again nothing. Having not been to Singapore previously we thought this would be a good attraction to get a sense of where things are in relation to each other obviously not. We did see on exiting that there was some information points scattered around but we were confused as to why these would not be inside the pods?Overall a disappointing experience and for the price you pay we did not think it was worth $66SPD for 2 adults."
"So u go there, park, walk walk to all until you eventually end up going up a wheel which is shorter than most buildings around.So not great wow factor. Don't not get me wrong the views are amazing, it going up any bar or restaurant in the CBD would get u similar views. But then there is nothing else to do, but to drive elsewhere. So better off being in Raffles or MBSs get a good glance of the Citi and do something else without needing to drive elsewhere."
"Ofcourse it's nice to go up in a ferris wheel and see the city light by night. But there are so many bars and hotels around the bay area that give you a similar view, plus they have the entertainment. Given the hefty entrance fee, it's not something I'd personally repeat."
A very good experience and spectacular view but ticket price is very expensive and there is no discount for local. 30 mins of ride
"These ferris wheels are becoming common is cities with lots of tourists, but Singapore doesn't need one. The attractions in Singapore are all at eye level.......walking around in Chinatown or Little India, shopping on Orchard Road, eating at one of the many food stalls. Enjoy Singapore by walking and eating, not by spending a boring hour in a Ferris Wheel that offers you a look at a skyline that really isn't all that inspiring."
"The views from the Flyer are good, but the same views are available from other cheaper vantage points in the city. My husband and I ended up paying $66 to take a 30 minute trip on the Flyer and were put into a capsule with a family who hogged the window space to takes selfies for the entire time and whose screaming children were jumping all over the place, including on our bags which were placed on the seat. All in all, our view from the Flyer was no better than the view from our hotel room and was inferior to the view from the Skypark of Marina Bay Sands. Don't waste your money."
"This is one of those eye giant ferris wheels...There is a lot to see from the cabin, but be prepared for some not so great customer experiences along the way. When we bought tickets (box office is nowhere near the entrance...) We got this major argument from the ticket person who insisted we pay full price for our 12 year old . They actually wanted an ID like we carry around a passport for purposes of showing her age. Really? Also seniors get NO discount unless they are from Singapore. Seems greedy. Attendants was off putting and rude, which is unusual here. Once on the car, the AC was obviously NOT working. Views were great but comfort was not. Shoddy service. Also kind of expensive at $33. Do not pay more. They also try to sell you green screen photos at highly inflated prices. DO NOT BUY THESE> Take your own photos in the cab."
"Once enough for life, specially due to the 25USD not worth the experience.Hard seats, no music, hot temp inside the cabin, obliged path thru narrow souvenirs shop.I don't regret, just due to the beautiful person accompanying me......"
I'm not really a big wheel fan but wanted see if it would impress me which it didn't. The views are better from some of the surrounding buildings and make sure you go to the bath room first!
"At SGD33 per head this isn't good value. The facility is getting shabby and frankly you can see more from the Marina Bay sands hotel. There's not much to say really, it's what you'd expect only pricier."
Don't mean to disparage but its kinda boring and too expensive. If you are a tourists in Singapore and don't have much mobility then maybe think about it but if you are young fit and healthy - there are so many other things to do
"The Singapore Flyer is an extremely dull ride, and at $33 per adult it is grossly over-priced. It is a contrived beat-up of an attraction, not worth bothering with. Five minutes into our half-hour ride we realised what a waste of time and money it was. Avoid it!"
"This is meant to be the Singapore equivalent of the London Eye.It is a unique way to see the southern part of Singapore, but frankly speaking the novelty wears off after 10 minutes or so.By all means, ride the Flyer if it is part of a package deal.And once you have ridden it, there is little reason to ride it a second time."
The flyer is huge. Moves very slowly so that u can enjoy yhe scene of Singapore from the air. Unfortunately the day we ventured out was hazy and nothing much was visible. So we felt as if we didn't get our money's worth.
Not worth to visit. Ãxpensive and boring. Weather is hot in Singapore and with the recent haze.... you may not be able to see far.
Boring typical way to get a mediocre view of Singapore. Better off to go to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark (observation deck). You will get a better and more comprehensive view of Singapore.
"I can understand that it's slow for a lot of reasons, BUT it's boring and you finished feeling anxiety!!The capsule was FULL of people!!Bad experience, but amazing views!"
Beginning was a good ride but for half hour for 1 round i think its bit too slow. Our visitors fm overseas looks bored.
This is an attraction that I don't understand. Unless you want to spend long time looking at Singapore from the Top. It's quite boring as it takes 30-40' to complete the ride...
Okay it's an impressive structure but I went at night and there was little to see.The pod was crowded and it is a tad boring. It's a bit cheaper than the London Eye and it feels an awful lot slower. I could always do without the obligatory picture to sell you.This review should not put you off just a suggestion that you should go in daylight hours.The viewing deck on the Marina Bay Sands hotel is way way better.
I have no idea if the flyer was operating or not..I have spent a week in Singapore and my hotel room had a view just on the flyer..I have never seen it moved during that time....so. We went to go there but we didn't...
Wasn't the best weather the day I went so was a bit overcast but overall I felt there weren't that great views. Yes you could see gardens by the bay and yes you could see marina Bay Sands but not the greatest angle. Perhaps this would be more impressive at night..... not worth the $33 fee
Just like any other flyer around the world. Heavily priced for just one round and since it often rains in Singapore you won't get to see much unless you wait out for the rain to stop.
The website and brochures will tell you that the opening hours are from 8.30 till 10.30pm. Don't turn up just before 10pm and expect to get on though. The ticket booth closes at 10pm. That's info worth knowing before you spend money getting there for a late night flight...
Too expensive and over hyped. Not worth the money you spend. Sitting in glass box and getting to see the bird eye view of singapore is fine for one time. However you getter view from marina bay observatory.
I think the ticket for singapore is over priced as comparison to view . No doubt the view is beautiful but still it's not a must watch for travellers with limited budgeted .
It is absolutely unnecessary to keep this flyer in a beautiful city of Singapore. Who has the time and inclination to go to a flyer ? There are many other good activities to be done in Singapore
"The view is fine, but the food was cafeteria quality. Also. the wine and champagne was extraordinarily over priced. We paid &150.00 for a bottle of Veuve Clicquot which you can buy at Binnys for under $60.00. They did not provide you with napkins for dinner. I had to use pocket tissue.Also, to add insult to injury, the rotation was too short for dinner. You were rushed to finish dinner before the rotation was completed. This was by far the worst expensive dinning experience that I have ever had."
"Well, to me it's just spending money to go up and see scenery that's all. No different from viewing it from a building. So it was a little boring and nothing much for me."
"Firstly we were put in with way too many people so didn't even get a seat. The carriage we were in was very noisy, so didn't really enjoy as much as we could have. The view was quite good, however for what we got don't think it was worth what we paid!"
Its an waste of money. People who stay at marina bay sands is an no go for them. it has same views as its from marina bay sands.
"Unless you are really really in need to ride a Ferris wheel in Singapore, u need not bother doing this. The view is not that great and the price wise is really expensive.Most locals don't bother visiting this tourist attraction once they have done it the first time as its really quite dull...For a lower price, u can instead visit Marina Bay Sands skypark which doesn't have a time limit and the view is higher and so much better. U can trust me and that's coming from a local. Cheers."
"My wife really wanted to go on this so I went. It takes like half an hour to go around and well, that's it. There's only so much looking at the skyline before it gets boring.It's also very expensive as well. I say double the speed, charge a 1/4 of the price and it'll be worth a visit."
"Kids were very excited then as soon as we got on excitement turn to boredom.Good view but it didn't do much for us, their family is for 2+1 but we are a family of 5 but we didn't mind paying AUD $150. Sadly we were quite disappointedThere isn't much to do around the area for the kids so after a boring ride it's time to go back to our hotel.In comparison to MOA eye area (Phils) where there were quite a lot of things to do and is suitable for all ages."
"Unless u want to get good photos shot from this flyer, don't bother. It's not like any big wheel ride I have ever tried. No feeling that the vehicle is moving and the entire cycle can take about 45 minutes to complete....."
The capsules are nice and of course the view is great but doing one round seems to take forever and it is quite pricey. At $33 per adult it seems a bit meh.You can get a great view from a place like Level 33 or 1 Altitude but have freedom to move around more and have a drink or use a bathroom.I think children will enjoy this attraction and if you want to go try and head there to catch sunset on the way up and night lights on the way down. From probably around 6:50 - 7:20pm as this is roughly sunset in Singapore.Overall it was clean and neat inside the capsule but would not do it again.
This is an expensive way to get a view of the city. Try any of the hotels in the city ad buy a drink on the roof bar and it won't cost as much.
"The Good:* The Singapore Flyer offers a good view of the Singapore skylineThe Bad:* The view gets a little stagnant after a while; awkward atmosphere at times with the other guests in the same ""cubicle"" similar to the ""passengers in the lift""* Better value from visiting Gardens By The Bay and soaking in the skyline of Singapore from rooftop bars / restaurants in the various skyscrapers of Singapore whilst sipping wine or a cocktail"
Strongly recommend that you should take it during night if you are supposed to make a visit to the Singapore Flyer.The entire ride will took around 30mins. The night scene is definitely one of the positives for it. It can be quite boring throughout the entire ride if you are supposed to take it alone as there is nothing else to do other than phototaking at the highest point.
I don't suffer from claustrophobia but I did on this attraction in Singapore!!Our children enjoyed it but became quickly bored. The same view is available at many other places around Singapore.The queues are long during peak times. I wouldn't recommend this.
Under rated attraction. Oversee views but nothing historic unlike London Eye. Price is reasonable to upkeep the venue. But nothing amazing. But I must say that the eateries are good. More outdoor activities encouraged.
"We were quite excited about going on the flyer as we read a lot of positive reviews and their website made it seem like this was an experience not to be missed. Unfortunately, it was the total opposite. The place was quite dead on a Saturday night. There was no queue or massive throngs of people waiting to get on the flyer. The staff manning the lines of people getting on or off the flyer looked bored. It was just 5 of us in our pod. While I do admit that the view is quite pretty, it wasn't so stunning that you needed to pay $33 for it. There are many other ways to enjoy the view, like roof top bars or skyscrapers/skyrise buildings nearby. The entire 30 minute ride was slow and boring. Initially, we were contemplating on buying the Premium Champagne Flight tickets ' luckily we changed our minds at the last minute. That would have been a complete waste of $69. I wouldn't recommend this ride to anyone and based on the very few people we saw that night (it was a weekend), they don't seem to be attracting that much of a crowd."
Not quite all that in bag of cheap. A drink at any of the plenty roof top bars will do the trick. Is overpriced for what you and and not a must do attractions while you are in Singapore
"Great panaromic views, though it does get mundane after a while. The price is a bit high too. It was a great experience, but needs no repetition."
The Singaproe Flyer is an OK way to have a look over the central business district of Singapore. I think it is about an hour ride like all the big ferris wheels sprouting over all the big cities in the world. Personally I think you get a better view going to the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel and have a drink at the bar or dinner there. Of course the drinks/dinnner are expensive there but then you are not paying a fee to go on a ride.
"It's nice to see from distance, but the ride it's slow and boring, not to mention overpriced. Deck at the Marina Bay Sands it's alot better."
This ride is ultimately boring and way more expensive than marina bay sands observation deck. Adult ticket will cost you 33sgd. Skip these and try to go to Marina Bay Sands Rooftop Bar instead and buy yourself a drink while enjoying the same skyline view.Cons:They wont allow us to have a separate capsule from the other tourist considering that there are no heavy line wait.
The capsule is aircon so the trip up was comfortable. Except for the annoying kid who keeps screaming. The haze really limit the views around so if it is there i wouldnt recommend it. Unless your ride is free then give it a go. Nice gifty shop at the end. The garden in the centre is nice. Thumb sideway.
At 33 SG$ it's expensive and there the noting great to see. The least they could have done is to provide a running commentary on short history of landmarks visible.
The view is quite nice however it does not justify the price paid.There are better ways to spend your money in Singapore.
"Seriously overhyped and not worth the queues at all!Firstly- the whole building at Singapore flyer is almost dead! There is a limited choice of dining options!!!Secondly - view at the top is limited, and the whole experience is over in 45 minutes!The money is better well spent at Skypark at marina bay sands!"
Nothing much to see for there is nothing new compare to other eyes (Flyers) in other cities. Must as well visit the spectators deck on 57th floor at MBS hotel.
This is a HUGE giant wheel but noting great. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Overall a boring experience and a waste of money.
"This is one of the must do attractions for tourists. My 2 cents worth though:1. Too expensiveAt $33 a pop for less than 30 minutes on the flyer, it feels like burning too much for too little time2. It could do with a little bit more life.The food stalls, shops, even the workers feel loke they're just going through the motions of another day.3. Something moreI feel like there are some improvements that can be made to the place. Don't get me wrong, the place is absolutely beautiful. But there is potential to be unlocked in this place, i believe.All in all, if you're looking for somewhere for photo ops, I'd say Marina Bay Sands view deck is a better choice since you can actually stay for as long as you want and are not limited by plexiglass panels around."
"Very touristy and just like other ferris wheels in urban cities. Nothing to write home about. We decided to pay for this ride to get a good view of the city. Perhaps if it were located closer to the middle of the downtown area instead of on the outskirts of the business district, there would have been more to see."
"The views from this attractions are undoubtedly superb, however we went and there was no line. Seeing another couple come out from a pod solo we asked if we could have a pod to ourselves and were told no and instead they let empty capsules go (we had an empty one before and after U.S.). Aside from this all the staff at the attraction weren't talking to customers and seemed more interested in talking with one another. Shame as I was interested in taking one of the premium packages next time but with service like this, will be spending elsewhere"
"doesn't really add anything to the Singapore experience. I suppose, if you've been on one big wheel you've been on them all."
"Pretty average experience, good view but scungy surrounding where the wheel is located. Should have a commentary..."
I personally think that it is not worth for money due to its high cost of a ride with just around less than 30 mins. Furthermore the view is not as good as taking the boat ride from Clark Quey. I believe that traveller don't mind to give a try if the price could be reduced.
So slow!! Great view but at some point you are just fed up! Very expensive though!!! Sometimes you can have very noisy neighbours! Not value for money
The Singapore Flyer is good for people who have not been on the other similar attractions. It does have a good view of the Marina Bay Area but that's about it. The booking clerk was very helpful and asked us to delay our trip by about an hour so that we could see the views in daylight as well as post nightfall with the citylights on. It would have been nice had there been some audio visual aid telling tourists about the sights visible as the flyer moved. The area around the flyer is quite underdeveloped with no activities and getting a taxi back after the ride was an hour long wait.
"On the 1st August 2020 I had a personally awful and quite traumatic experience at the Singapore Flyer (SF).Having waited in an external queue for 1 hour I was informed by the SF staff that it was a further 2 hour wait inside before boarding. Upon which I was given the option to reschedule my visit or wait in the queue.Considering it was now 8pm, the onsite manager did not seem to be concerned about the potential 10pm boarding time or the 1 hour queue which was following me. They had not been informed of the prospect of not being able to board the Singapore flyer within the advertised operating hours.I am appalled by this general disregard for the paying public and would hope the SF revise their operating procedures.In all fairness, upon request I have been promised a full refund, and I do plan to rebook in the future, but being conscious of and taking into account the poor operating procedures. I will allow 3 hours queuing time. With the hope of having an enjoyable experience at what could be a world leading attraction.It's just a shame that the customer experience focus has been lost.....maybe this is due to COVID-19, or maybe not? I will leave you to form your own opinion should you wish to visit the SF.Make sure you plan on a 3 hour queue and don't believe the the online time slots! Good luck!PS you would be better spending your money to have a cocktail at MBS rooftop....it's cheaper and the views are better.... #justsaying....."
Afraid that the flyer is a bit of a joke for Singaporeans as its still broken. Our cab driver and friends who live in Singapore both referred to it as an artwork.
"When we visited the Bay Area the flyer was not working, we were told two different reasons.......one it wasn't attracting enough people......the other was that it was having maintenance done."
"Having checked the cost and times of the ""Singapore Flyer"" the day before, we were very disappointed it was closed for maintenance when we arrived by taxi. There was no information about this on their web site. I don't know how often these closures occur."
"One of the cables has broken and is waiting to be replaced.Currently out of action , great location to visit as it's home of Formula 1 race track"
"Looked at the website to make sure the flyer was running. Was able to buy tickets on site but when I got there, paid for my taxi and exited the vehicle I was then approached by the member of staff advising the flyer will be closed for a few weeks. When asked about getting a refund due to pre-booking tickets I was only advised to send an email to the customer services. Views on the Marina Bay Sands are better then what you would be able to see on the flyer."
Hoping to try out the Flyer but was very disappointed that it was not operating. We had a look around the area and were told there was technical problems associated with the operation.
The Singapore Eye is best to go with someone before she becomes your girlfriend. The 30 minutes ride will bring both of you into another level of relationship. And I am sure you will score high points in her heart. Enjoy the nice scenery of Singapore and tell her your dreams and your future plans. One important thing to note is never step into the carriage where there are kids. It's too noisy! I took the rides a few times and I dare to say I have the experience to comment on this. :)
"The hardware isn't bad at all - it is fairly new and clean. It is the biggest flyer I have ever visited. The problem is the people who managed it.Our cell have 17 people!!At first, there was only 7 peoples (we had). Later, before the door was closed, 10 peoples (Koreans) together with a tourist rushed in... Suddenly the cell became a noisy market! There was no escape until the door was reopened again, after whole 20 more minutes!! We wanted to enjoy a quite Singapore night scene, not a market! If we wanted market we would visit local hawker food court! That was a nightmare!Look! I am not blamming those Koreans for having fun and party. But the operator should arrange them to another cell instead jamming all 17 people in one cell. (There was no other tourist waiting on the line as I saw!!) All other 6 people are keeping almost silence the whole tour. I guess they were not happy either.Later we found our there was only 6 people in my next cell!(Did I forget to mention in the cell there was a tourist broadcasting out loud all the time!)I visited Singapore Flyer on 26/9 around 19:00."
Arrived on time to wait in a room that didn't have enough seating for the amount of people doing the experience. Communication was pretty poor and given we were doing an experience that included alcohol I didn't expect children to be allowed (we had 2). We were herded into the capsule and it was incredibly crowded. Didn't enjoy the experience at all and would not recommend to anyone. If you want a view better to do marina bay sands observation deck.
Too expensive. View from the top was not that great. Not sure I'll recommend my friends and family to try.
It was worst experience to visit this place. Poor customer service.its overpriced and long queues and humid
"Very disappointed because of continuous jabber from loudspeakers inside the cabin. It's just nonsense - I came with my girlfriend to have a pleasure... and ALL THE TIME unpleasant, annoying, troublesome voice of a woman sounded from loudspeakers. Very loud voice. Stupid jokes and intonations. I'm not a dull schoolboy, I did not agree with that brainwashing."
Very bad experience view been block by marina bay sand no really recommend to do at night if want see night view got rent a scooter is more worth it
"Over hyped marketing. Over-rated by locals. Over charged with nothing spectacular!In other words, BORING!"
It is a very slow revolving cabin for city view.The waiting time was over 60 min.Not worth the money.
"We were excited to visit the Singapore Flyer, and were pleased to see that there was no waiting for a pod to arrive. In retrospect that was probably a bad sign. In fact we had a pod completely to ourselves which was great as it was air conditioned and comfortably cool.The experience lasts around 30 minutes and gives a great view of the city. However, there isn't that much to see, unlike the wonderful London Eye.There are good views of the city, the Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, but that's about it.We had tickets as part of a package but wouldn't pay to visit it under normal circumstances."
"1. The view don't really look interesting as there are so many brand new tall buildings. No character .... only very few pockets of interesting view - nostalgic ... the rest just uninspiring concrete jungle.2. And because of the ""view"", the price is not worth it ...3. I visited the place more than 7 years ago ... the option on when did you travel ... not applicable."
"I have been mislead by their website & purchased 3 tickets for me & my friends to ride the flyer tonight. I incorrectly purchased a local ticket. I was happy to pay the difference for a full ticket however they refused to allow this. Their answer was to fill out a customer feedback form??? Strongly suggest you give this attraction a miss, got great photos from MBS & other great Singapore attractions"
Bad attitude of staff members....ride was so so and pricey...waste of money....not a place for tourists
This great view venue was not open when we visited. Situated on the water front it gives a great view of the area.
"Unfortunately, this attraction was out of order when we visited at easter 2018. Not very good information, just a small sign at the entrance."
"We went there and they said it was were closed for maintenance, No notice in the Internet about it. Wasted our valuable time.Should check before visiting the place. Better to call and see."
"Having booked an evening dining experience on the flyer, we were very disappointed to be informed that there were technical issues which meant our trip was cancelled. We understand that these things happen, however it appears that we were able to make our booking AFTER the flights were suspended due to the issue!! We have now been informed that it will take between 6 and 8 working WEEKS before we receive our refund! Terrible customer service. We definitely will not be recommending this to anyone."
"other than the view there nothing much to be up here. unless u want to be trapped in here with someone for a period of time, please avoid this slow moving ride. if its not free i wont b up here too."
We were in Singapore gor five days but never saw the flyer in operation even though we went by it every day.
Very disappointing to cross town to go on the Singapore flyer only to find it shut down for maintenance. I could find no reference to it being closed for repairs etc even though it must have been closed for at least a week. I was really looking forward to the experience / views from the big wheel.
"I appreciate that safety had to come first but we were only advised just over a week prior to our dinner booking that the flyer was not working, despite it being out of action for a number of weeks with no completion date for the works.A month later we still do not have our refund, so it looks like we will have to ask our credit card people to try and get the money back for us. Fortunately even at such short notice we were able to book at C'est la vie on the Marina Bay Sands Skypark where we had a very good meal."
It was possibly due to Chinese New Year but it always seemed to be closed. We were dropped off by a taxi to be told it wasn't operating that day. We didn't ever see it operational for all the time we were in Singapore.
"We have just returned from Singapore. My wife desperately wanted a trip on the Flyer. We took the Hop On Hop Off bus (Yellow Line) which dropped us off at the Flyer facility. On entering we were informed that the Flyer has been out of serve since the beginning of January due to a lightning strike and they were waiting for spare parts, with no re-opening date yet planned. I urge you to check before going to see if the Flyer is back up and working"
I wasted mny and time for this place as i thought i will have complete view of singapore from the top. But next day when i went to marina sands hotel roof by paying 25 sgd it's much more fascinatin than this place. so do gonto marina sands roof top if u wanna be on the highest point in singapore.
"At $87 for 2 adults and a 3 year old, this attraction was not worth it. The views from the flyer are great, but there are plenty of places to see nice views in Singapore."
"It was expensive and the view was not that spectacular. However, it will be amazing if you would be able to obtain tickets on Singapore National Day and view the parade if it is on the floating platform."
"I was very disappointed, walked there from our hotel in the heat and humidity, to find no ticket booths open. Asked for help and the attendants sent us to another closed ticket booth...we could see that the flyer had people on it but many of the shuttles were empty..not happy at all"
It's just a waste of time. I have heard visitors from India who were with us in the same booth to quarrel themselves over taking selfies at the top and pleading to take some fun as they are sure not to come again. This was our feeling too. The small garden at the ground is a nice reconciliation though.
"Just to see the view is a waste of money because it is too expensive and you are only given a 30min ride with nowhere to go, sticking in the capsule. Not worth the time. If you want to see a better view go to One Altitude (At least you given a paid drink and you can enjoy the music with no time limit) or Mount Faber which is free."
"First, they canceled our ride due to weather. Second, they take a picture of us as we entered and said it was free only to find out later that they charge a fee for printing but were deceptive in saying taking the picture is free. This ride is a total scam. There are more places around Singapore that you can appreciate the view at lesser cost."
The attraction of Singapore Flyer is not on a must do list....group travellers r involuntarily bound to visit the attraction...Priced at SGD33 per head u hv to go through a serpentine alley to reach the cable cars....To plainly say the user fee is very high for one time use compared to the satisfaction we rcv.
"Boring n pricey. Not worth the money n time. There should b commentaries to interest us. Also, there should b seats so that the old n less mobile people can view in some comfort."
The price was too much for a half an hour view of the city. Wasn't much for the 3 year old with us as well.
it was a very bad experience at singapore flier on 11th feb 2017. we got out from bus and started taking pictures from our camera . one of couple just stopped to take a picture and leave thier bag on the grass and by mistake they left the bag but within 5 minutes when we came back to see the bag . we dont found the bag when talked to security people about the same and told them to see on the cctv what happened and call the police . but they were very rude and behaved very badly they took approximatly 1 hour in hanky and panky discussions and not called the police . when asked our guide vinny who was localite of singapore she also not able to give us the police number and not helped us to call the police . when talked to driver of the van in which we had started for the city tour he also refused to go to police station . when told that we have hired you for complete day and u have to go wherever we say he finally agreed to took us to the nearby police station in all this useless talks and discussions we had lost approximatly 1.5 hour inspite of helping us they were not kind enough to even give us advise what to do .the bag contains passports and approximatly 5000 dollars . when gone to police they also took 2 hour to lodge a complaint .and finally that couple missed the programme of cruise which was very bad experiencemy main point to inform all world that whenever u go to singapore dont expact any help or anything like that from singapore people because they are very rude and unhelpfull. so if u go to singapore be coutious from the pickpockets and thiefs because if u trap in their racket u will not be helped by the security people and the localites .
"I went a week ago, on a Saturday, with my wife. The flyer was more than half empty.We were hurriedly ushered into a cabin to be shared by 2 Indian families. One of the families had a horrible brat who likes to kicks and throw tanturms. The parents were really spoiling their brat by being unable to control him.They too spoil our scenic ride by moving too often, blocking our view of the scenes. Too noisy!The service staff were horrible. Should be sack.Not worth AT ALL to go and spend your afternoon. It is a 30+ minute ride but it feels like a day!"
Nice view. Takes about 30 minutes. Costs about 33 Singapore dollar per person. Great view for top. Few eateries and souvenir shops nearby.
Overpriced and totally not worth it. Better views from other locations. What an anticlimax. Not recommended.
The flyer barely moves. Your money can be well spent on something else. Views are better from MBS or another building in the area.
"We were most upset and disappointed that we couldn't get in to the flyer whole we were at the F1. We had tickets for the wrong area and even though the kind security guards let us in to the flyer, we couldn't go on it as the ticketing booths were closed.We were happy to pay but could not. My son was very let down and it put a bit of a damper on the occasion.I write this review ONLY to share our experience and warn everyone for next year, should the F1 even rake place. Who knows at the moment?"
"Extremely bad service and every time you go to collect your tickets they are ""on lunch"" missed out a full day of our 5 days pass because of the staff being ""on lunch"". And they are on linch for more than an hour in all three airport terminals at one - how in a service industry are they all on lunch at once - terrible singapore service!! Bringing down the tourism industry"
The flyer go stop every few minutes and after sometime you just feel trapped in the capsule.The better option to enjoy the view if sungapore from a height is to go to Marina Bay Sands deck which is not only cheaper option but also give you more time to enjoy the view.The other option is to go to one of the many roof top restaurants and bars where you can enjoy the view and have a drink or dinner.
"Dead boring. Extremely slow 30 mins ride. Not thrilling for young couples. Too slow for families with small children as nothing fascinating to see and children may want to get off anytime. Not sure the oldies will appreciate it more. But the landscape is not amazing in comparison with The Big Eye in London. If you must go, find a clear weather day where the sky is electric blue. Night time maybe more scenic."
"Though much is made of the Singapore Flyer (like the flyers or the eyes in other major cities), it is a big disappointment.Once you are inside, you don't even feel that you are moving, unless you look at the other cabins. We almost went to sleep. It is that damn slow!Tickets are expensive. Takes 30 minutes for a full round and the views that it offers are hardly something you can continue looking at for 30 minutes. Avoid it!"
Too expensive (like the rest of Singapore) for what you get and the ride is rather boring. We had to go stand by the side doors to get a view because the main front window had persipitation on and we were angle to see anything
This is the best place to get a bird's eye view of Singapore city. Walking distance from the Bayfront MRT station. Not at all crowded. Each round takes around 20 minutes. The ticket prices are high. I would say it's not a value-for-money attraction. But one could click excellent Singapore skyscrapers photograph from here.
"Singapore Flyer is a must do !!! Great views. Can walk around the carriage and great photo opportunities.. We did on first day of stay, it helped us gain our bearing & where tourists sites are located.. Try for a weekday as weekends are very busy, and long lines."
"Our last night in Singapore and had booked for dinner on Flyer. Big Mistake. Had to walk some distance as roads still closed due to Grand Prix, only received notification from Flyer after the event. Signage as to where you went poor. Got to the ""lounge"" and tried to order a drink, gave up after tried three choices and they had none despite having them on menu, which was held together with duck tape. Then to dinner. Soup luck warm, main bit of chicken and disgusting veges and beef kebabs, 2 pieces of meat on stick again disgusting veges. Dessert a piece of dried up cake on plate.Positives the waiter that tried his best and was very friendly and the wonderful view as we went round twice. Suggest if you want to go, just go for the view NOT the meal."
"Built during the world frenzy of cities needing to build a wheel of some sort, this is no poor effort!Before the 'flying boat' was built next door, the Flyer offered unsurpassed views of Singapore and the harbour, albeit at a steep price! The price remains, but better views can be found elsewhere.If you're into the wheels of the world, you should try this one though."
"If you want to see the skylights of Singapore, there are many ways to do it. You can enjoy the view With a cocktail drink at many cafes dotted around the Marina Bay. Why go to a flyer? Not only it is expensive, it is boring experience."
"It was a very bad experience for me and my family, it is a complete waste of time as it goes around for 45 mins, instead I highly recommend going to the Marina Bay Sands Skypark. Do not waste your time here."
"We went on the last ride on 26/12. It was just a big wheel moving very slow (1 circle for around 30mins) nothing impressed, after 10mins we regretted to come. Didn't see any happy face when finished."
This is just a big wheel turning in a slow circle. There is nothing much to do. A visit to any of the restaurants in the skyscrapers around Marina Bay would give as good a view. Not worth the time or the money.
2nd time on the flyer. Both times had staff displaying undesirable service standards and utter lack of respect. More so at the 2nd level entrance.Would definitely consider other options when entertaining overseas clients!
Not worth the price tag of $33!!! This is madness pricing. Less than 20 mins on top and the whole thing moves very slowly. Will definitely never return again. I would rather spend my precious time somewhere else.
"The flyer is close, when we want to try it .It seems get out of order.But in the evening is the flyer decorated with wonderful lights"
"It was just 30 minutes ride for a big sum of money. Think of it, you spend 15 mins at the higher side of the wheel.Glasses were abit dusty, difficult for photography. Too expensive.There are better alternatives such as MBS rooftop."
It doesnt impress me like it looks in the tv. Singapore its just too small and expensive. They will not give you any best travelling exprience.
"Singapore Flyer was the world's tallest ferris wheel. Price range is excessive expensive (SGD$33/adult) for 30 minutes ride and being 165m off the ground. Furthermore, there are no commentary or hand out document whatsoever available for the customers.At night, it was such a disappointment to find dusks, greasy/oily marks and fingerprints all over the windows in the cabin. For that price, windows should be cleaned."
"Compared to other ""wheels"" around the world this is the worst. It is slow and the lack of commentary makes it an expensive boring 30 mins!Much better to go to another high point in the city and do a 360 turn you will see the same view quick for less money!"
"Singapore has one of the most fantastic skylines in the world and the idea of seeing it from (the now) second largest Ferris wheel in the world is tantalizing. However, this is an over rated tourist trap. If you are traveling on a budget and/or have a short stay in Singapore you can pass up this experience without doubt.The Flyer is indeed beautiful- but from the ground as part of Singapore's skyline. From the inside it is just not as exciting.And for those Ferris wheel lovers and families with kids: This is not a 'ride'-the experience isn't thrilling as a Ferris wheel should be and it becomes boring very quickly."
"Seriously, if you've ever been in an airplane or on a tower, you've seen better views. It was clean, comfortable, and so, so boring...just a slowly moving view of the city. If this is a must-do, man, Singapore needs some more attractions."
"These over sized Ferris Wheels are basically all the same weather it is Singapore, Melbourne, Paris or London the only difference is the view"
"Don't waste your time to go to the Singapore flyer, its closed. You can see Marina bay which is very near to Singapore flyer, as a tourist you have a lot of connections to other tourist places from Singapore flyer."
This is possibly the most boring activity in all of Singapore. The flyer spins at a snail's pace. The service is absolutely terrible. There's a lot of better ways to spend 30 minutes of your time.
"Prior to entering a ""cabin"", a person directed us to stand at a certain place and then, he proceeded to take photos of us.I told him that I didn't want our photos to be taken.He angrily stared at us and waved us to get out.He could have asked whether we would like our photos to be taken by him in the first place but he didn't.Totally unacceptable behaviour. Very rude!"
"We bought four e-tickets from CTrip in advance and took my kid to go and take the Sinagpore flyer. Unfortunately, we could not find the entrance. After we found it, it was about 19:40. A member of staff (a strong lady) at the ticket office told us the e-ticket was only valid before 19:30 (Honestly, I did not notice the small letters about the conditions). I told her it was our last day in Sinagpore, hope she can let us in. But the strong lady still kept her long face and rejected to provide any further assistance. As they were unrefundable tickets, we wasted about 450 RMB."
"Badly maintained interior and expensive price tag for a view which is high up but not impressive. Duration of about 30mins, cramped with strangers and really looking at things from a higher height, without live commentary.Ticket can amount to a good lunch at any better restaurants with a better top view and more comfortable setting."
"Did this as a corporate group. In a city/state that has so many options for high-altitude viewing, this felt like the worst of them. Not only is it extremely slow, the views it gives isn't anything you can't see from other places like MBS or the hundreds of other bars boasting views.If you don't mind viewing the same thing for 30 minutes in a car full of other people who are too busy taking selfies to even look around, go ahead. This would not be on my list of things to do if I was only in Singapore for a couple days."
"Gotten a student discount on the tickets but still wasn't worth going. Half an hour in the flyer, there wasn't even any audio guide telling you about Singapore. It was just... Looking into the distance for half an hour..."
"This was the worst money we spent in Singapore. The windows were fogged up which defeated the purpose of going up that high and it takes 30 minutes to do a full lap, in fogged up windows that you can't see out of. Do not bother!"
"Don't remember how much we paid, but it was quite a bit. Certainly regretted it. A very slow moving ferris wheel with views of the city (which you can easily see from any tall building in the area). Do it if you really need to kill time."
"The daily trawl of tourists in coachloads from the package holidays, line up for a 'trip' in the Flyer. Unlike the superb London Eye, this similar looking wheel looks the same from the outside but on the inside offers a different experience. There is no guide to assist you as to what you are looking at, the air con is doing its best to keep you cool but struggles when you are in a sealed glass bowl on the equator and elevated nearer to the sun. Unlike the London Eye which is only surpassed by the Shard on height, you will spend much of the trip looking up at buildings as they are taller ! Several of these buildings also offer you free or cheaper access (except Marina Bay Sands which is $10 more). Also these other buildings offer refreshments, natural air and the option to go to the toilet if you've been over drinking water to keep you cool. Save time and money and do not even consider doing the very cheesy glass of champagne spin for $130. Rumour has it they are doing their best to repay the huge amount they spent on putting it up there. Finally, they put it in the wrong place. For a great view go to Altitude 1, OUE, Swissotel, UOB viewing floor or best of all Level 33 bar at the Standard Chartered Building."
"A spectacular and biggest ferry wheel, that's abt it. Small museum leading to the ride is much more informative and interesting then the ride in the wheel.Once up in the wheel is like a boring and endless wait to get out. Not worth the trip. Good variety of fnb outlets at the location though."
I've heard mix reviews for the flyer and had to see for myself.The verdict:1) The retro looking foodcourt reminiscent of our old Singapore days is good but pricey.2) It is nice to take a photo of the Singapore Flyer at night with its pretty lights (best spot is across the river)3) Your money will be better spent elsewhere if you want intend to pay to sit inside the flyer to see the Singapore skyline as there are better places like MBS skywalk or One Altitude
This place was a total waste of time. It was very boring and I would never want to go there ever again. It was shocking The place was all cramped and it was bad. My rating out of 10 is 1.
"For 30 SGD, the Singapore flyer is terribly overpriced for a view and a 40-minute ride. First of all you need to share the ride with around 15-20 people. If you're lucky it'll be less. Maybe only 9 or so of you will get to sit on the seats in the centre of the compartment and the rest will have to stand, ostensibly at the edges looking out.I cannot fault the view, of course, but paying 30 bucks for this is absolutely ridiculous, considering you can get a similar good view for as long as you like by going to Pinnacle@Duxton at nearby Tanjong Pagar and heading to the top floor. You do need an EZ-Link card though (1 per person, so a little inconvenient) but considering you only pay 5 bucks for a view (and you get to stay as long as you like and sit and stand if you so wish) the Singapore flyer is truly a rip-off."
Son went on this & loved it. There are excellent food stalls under it at reasonable cost. Super fresh squeeze juice stall too--not dear. All the Hopon/hopoff buses park here so good spot to check them out & start circular tour from there. DO NOT get the cheapest one (orange colour) as they finish too early. I was surprised when I read timetable after I had paid. Saw others in city in the evenings so I think better value as they run for longer.
"You pay too much stand in a capsule that inches slowly for one cycle which gives you an elevated view of a skyline that is better observed along the Singapore River or the Esplanade. You take photos for about 5 mins, then turn to your friends or relatives and find things to talk about. Boring, overpriced and not value-for-money."
"What a bore. The great thing about say the London Eye is that there are actually landmarks to spot on the way up and down. Singapore does not have these icon and historic buildings to look out for. If your idea of fun is going very slowly round in a circle looking at not a lot then go ahead.If you are going for the view and photo opportunities, best to keep your money (its not cheap for what it is) and head to Ku De Ta at the top of Marina Bay Sands. The money you saved on not going on the Flyer can be used to buy a refreshing drink and you get much better views and much better photos."
"The concept and experience is terrific however recommend you DON'T do the dining experience. Grossly overpriced and the food would be better at MacDonalds. Served just tepid steak that was dry, tasteless and tough. Had one mouthful. A complaint was met with 'OK'. Total disinterest . Could have been a real money earner but quality and service lets,it down."
"If you are doing the Flyer - Bring your iPad! It's incredibly boring. Exciting for only a few moments, the 1/2hr ride is way too slow.... My 2yo was so bored she started bouncing off the walls. There are better ways to get a view of Singapore"
My experience was single-handedly one of the most traumatic I've had while travelling. It was my last night in Singapore I had an accident at the building of the flyer. The proprietor of the cafe did not offer any assistance as I had hurt myself but after telling the staff on the flyer what had happened I managed (with persistence) to get a manager to talk to. In fact she sniffed her nose at me and continued talking (I did not enjoy the Singaporean customer service).I ended up being wheeled off the flyer in a wheelchair and slugged $200 for the most expensive hospital in Singapore (closest in the area) and then slugged again another $20 (ish) dollars for the taxi to get back to my hotel.This ruined the next part of my trip.Unfortunately there is not much that can be done to get my money back because the Singapore consumer affairs won't touch the matter and the Flyer have washed their hands clean of the matter but that is another issue not for this review...all I would say is don't get hurt on it!Putting aside my personal experiencePROSI had a private cabin with drinks.The Singapore Slinger is nice - but if you are scared of heights dutch courage is not going to help.Reaction time of the staff members.CONSThis is in the title. If you are scared of heights. Do not ride the wheel. I spent my night in pain and bawling my eyes out because I was terrified of the ride and the horrible experience. Not exactly the romantic night I planned eh?The view seems to be blocked by buildings - from the photos I've seen since I was too frightened to look around.Having to literally jump onto the flyer but yet was wheeled out afterwards.I am really glad I didn't pay for the dinner. An hour in pain plus the heights thing would have set me off a lot more.
"It was so borring, the line is a trick. They let 6 people out onto the deck so it looks like there is no line, though what they don't tell you is that its a giant building full of lines inside which take a further 30 minutes to get to the front of the line. Once on the flyer you will be amazed.....for the first 4 minutes, the next 26 minutes on the flyer will bore you to tears, and the worst part is you can't get out when you're done. If you're doing it for the views you're better off to vist the observation deck of the C, its about the same price same view and you can leave when you please! DON'T DO THE FLYER!"
The managers there are dumb. They can't facilitate the crowd properly. And plain ignorant to the questions hurled at them. They should brush up on their English and give us a good explanation on the waiting time.
We could see these views for the most part from hotels. It was a dissapointment. It went slow and there were too many people in our carraige.
"What a waste of time and money. This is about upselling you stuff to take home.If you want to see Singapore at night or during the day, you're better off with a reservation and eat or drink at top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel or paying the cost to go up there -- it is higher & a better view & you aren't stuck there for 45 minutes.Singapore could have made its rival to the London Eye worthwhile & do what London did - provide you with some information about what you are looking at, about the land reclamation projects, about where the original Singapore ended and about what you are seeing.But, nobody did that.Instead you are riding in a glass bubble for 45-odd minutes with no information on what you are looking at.All they have is a pamphlet in the bubble that is mainly advertisements for fast food (at the park where the ride is), stores & trinkets (you have to walk through a trinket-filled store to exit). The 4 or 5 items per each view (North, South, East and West) are on the bottom of the pamphlet in the corner.The pamphlet's information about ""Top 3 must-try food!"" and ""Top 3 merchandise to bring home!"" is bigger than the information about what you are viewing.No map. Nothing.There were 2 kids aged 8-11 in my bubble, and they were bored to tears & began climbing on everything.The London Eye is so, so, so much better for this kind of thing (there is a lot of history to see from it, but apparently nothing from the Flyer).What a disappointment."
"Hi everyone, I went to the Singapore Flyer in March this year for the first time and this was terrible, yucks! So expensive and you expect people to pay so muuch for it! Although they say there is a terrific view on the top, it was so fake! I really thought I had wasted my damn time there. So don't go please. Thanks."
"It's slow. It's for geriatrics. Half of the wheel turn shows a decent skyline. the other (descending) shows private apartment blocks facing east. Save this for when you are retired and thrill rides will give you a heart seizure.Unlike the London Eye, this is not giving you a view of one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world."
"For a slow moving flyer, it is better to go to Marina Bay Sands and get a much better view of SIngapore"
U are rushed into a capsule which takes u to a height and gets u back in about an hour.....The view is the same that you have seen from the observatory deck in the Marina Bay Sands.......This is just a marketing tool to fool tourists.Please don't fall for it. Total Waste of money
Tickets are too overpriced. Nothing much to say buy it $1/min for the ride.
We dont mind paying $10 of a coffee in a hotel lounge. But certainly things are priced way too high with quality way below the user's expectation. It is mainly meant for one off type of business transaction. I am refering to the eateries and services around this areas.
"Forget it - go to London, Wien[the original] or Shanghai - this is just a rip off"
"I love this place because of the way animals are kept, they look healthy and relatively happier than any other zoo I have seen, allowing them to live is relatively closer to their native living place and not like a cageMust visit place in Singapore"
"Haven't been here for years and after visiting several zoos around the region, must say that this is the best zoo I have even been to.The absence of cage and well designed moat around most enclosures allows us with unobstructed view of the animals in their natural habitat, albeit man made. The animals looked comfortable and well fed.The grouping of the enclosure and the pathway leading to them make for a joyful trip of discovering. The wordings are just sufficient to introduce the important points about the animals.Staff are helpful and happy. A great 3 hours trip.In terms of refreshment, lots of drink vending machine can be found with small food kiosk and a food court. Oh, there's also a KFC at the end of the zoo before you turned back and head to the entrance/exit."
"A beautifully kept zoo! The range of animals was fantastic! It sets itself apart from other zoos with the free roaming animals, orangutans overhead and experience exhibits. The zoo also seemed to do a lot for conservation and there was lots of cool interactive features."
"Singapore Zoo is really a gem. Can't say how proud I am to have such a world class zoo in our city.Love how educational our zoo is and the amazing variety of animals we have here.Easy to get around, I think it's worth a visit just for fun if you haven't been to the zoo for ages like myself.Keep it up Singapore zoo team!"
"It was rather exciting and a very personalised private tour! Really big thanks to our wildlife experience guide Neetha and Gen :) Had a request for mandarin speaking guide and they really they tried their best to explain to us in Chinese haha. They were also able to make an advance booking for us for animal presentation and allow us to go in without any booking in advance made by ourselves. Fuss free!They were also really patience despite having my dad not being able to catch up and corporate at times. However, the private buggy tour were really fun ! Will definitely come back for more.Personally I would recommend coming in the morning slot (930am) as you would get more time to walk around and taking a look at the zoo. Also, a properly planned itinerary will also make the tour a lot more fun as well.Overall, I felt that my 2nd day of outing to zoo was well spent!"
"Used our SRV (rediscovery voucher) and was so glad we did that. Having been to massive zoos in China, I think WRS is truly a WILDLIFE zoo. Great diversity of nature and the beauty of all kinds of wildlife. Also a very enriching & knowledge-filled place , allowing us to appreciate nature at her best. Thanks for reminding us that size of the animals is not the only yardstick of beauty !My husband did however noticed that we were pretty far from the animals , he would loved if we are closer. Also an itinerary of performance time slots at the e-ticket email or a flyer at the entrance area would be handy. We didn't get to watch any performance while we were there, I was too tired to google for the time slots."
Such nostalgia. Came here ever since i was a little girl. Would always come here again no regrets. :)
"Singapore Zoo is listed as one of the world's best zoo not for nothing. It has all the traditional zoo animals like elephants, tigers, lions, monkeys, and crocodiles, but it also has many unique and endangered animals like the alligator shaped turtle and the babirusas, also called deer-pigs. It is in the swine family found in Sulawesi, Togian, Sula and Buru. Singapore zoo is also home for giraffes, zebras, warthogs, rhinos, lions, cheetahs and many others. There is also play and activity area for young kids to have fun."
"It was indeed very heartwarming to visit Singapore zoo especially with their conservation programs ensuring the protection of some endangered species of which they house 34% of it. Built in 1973 and set on a 26 hectares land in a natural open rain forest environment in Mandai Lake. It has over a million visitors annually and houses more than 30 species of animals. If you would like to relax, take some good photos and videos, escape from the hustle and bustle of the big city and most of all contribute to the conservation and rehabilitation of threatened species then have some time to visit SG zoo. If you book online tickets are cheaper than walk in. Also, if you will avail their annual membership you will get discounts and privileges. The zoo is part of the trip of parks called Wildlife Reserves Singapore together with Jurong Bird Park and the Night Safari. The zoo is pretty big so if you wanna spare walking then you can take a tram for a quick drive by tour of the zoo's different areas. The zoo is divided into 11 zones namely Australasia, Elephants of Asia, Fragile forest, Great rift valley of Ethiopia, Primate kingdom, Reptile Garden, Wild Africa, Treetops trail to name some of those I've visited. In addition they have numerous shows and activities. As you enter the zoo you might get overwhelmed but my tip is to just follow the flow and to help you can download their Digital Map guide. You could go right and you'll pass by the African Penguins which is currently closed which will lead you straight to Ah Meng Restaurant or go left via the Tree top trail and will lead you to the Rainforest. Either way will give you access to different zones in the zoo. I personally walked my way to different zones and took my approximately 3 hours. Be mindful with the Show timings and audience since there is crowd control measures during the pandemic. Facemasks are also required whilst you are in the zoo. I loved everything - how they designed the zoo in an open natural environment which is really remarkable. A lot of animals are securely placed in their zones, moats were provided to some and they have ample space. Some you could even interact with like the Fragile forest where you could be up close to the Flying Fox, Birds, Butterflies, and Deers. My favorite attractions are the Bengal White Tiger, Elephants of Asia, Hamadryas Baboon, Nubian Ibex, Animals in the Fragile Forest, Giraffe, Orangutans, the Otters, Pygmy Hippopotamus, Grey Kangaroo and the funny cute Meerkats who are always on the lookout. The Bengal white tigers (2 of them) are housed in a huge open space mini forest enclosure with water filled moat. They showcased elegance, strength, confidence and beauty especially with their furs in white and black stripes. Elephants of Asia showcases Asian Elephants all five of them female coming from Sri Lanka and Sumatra to name a few. They have a very earthy enclosure and I loved to see when their being fed. Despite their huge sizes they eat slowly with the help of their trunks before gently chewing the grass. The Baboons and Ibex are placed in the Great Rift Valley. It was designed like a rock mountain cliff similar to the environment where they live in Ethiopia plus an Amazing waterfalls. It's surprising to to see this mix of 2 species side by side showing no conflicts. The Baboons of course are very proud and confident as always especially displaying their pink faces, fluffy grey furs and huge fangs. The Ibex on the other have no problem maneuvering the slippery rocks even with those long sharp horns. The Grey Kangaroos too where such a lovely animals. Their enclosure have huge space for them to leap, feed and interact with each other. I really felt I was in Australia. When I reached Wild Africa it was already sunset. And it was such a scenic scene specially with the Giraffes. 2 of them while standing against the sunset is such an epic scene. I took a couple of photos and it was marvelous. Just across the Giraffes there is a small Earth mound with small pocket holes. And inside these holes lives the Meerkats, cute little stripped Mongoose from Southern Africa. I could see 2 of them watching the skies for predators which is really really natural. I took a photo of one peeking his head from one of the holes. Finally, the Orangutans from Sumatra or the Great Apes with their striking red orange furs are housed in a magnificent enclosure with trees, vines and resting places. Here the family could be seen interacting, resting, feeding, sleeping and gently swinging way up on the vines and trees. Native to Malaysia and Indonesia, Orangutans are critically endangered species but glad that Singapore Zoo is here to ensure the survival of this species. You can have a 360 degree view of them as you walk your way on the platform just outside their enclosure. As I walked along my way in the zoo I couldn't help but noticed that it is very clean, well managed, follows the social distancing guidelines, and very informative. There are plenty of toilets, drinking fountains, and vending machines for food/snacks. Ah Meng Restaurant also provides a lot of food options, coffee and snacks. I finished my day arriving at their souvenir shop just on time before they close at 6 and I bought a small shirt for my nephew. Outside the entrance there are plenty of food shops and KFC, which I had my lunch. If you wanted to visit the River and Night Safari they are just right outside the zoo and the latter open at 630 PM. Getting here I took the Mandai Khatib Shuttle but there are many ways to get here. It was indeed another heartwarming experience to visit SG zoo and each visit I take has its own story, witnessing how these lovely Animals live like in their natural environment. One of the best zoos in the world!!! I couldn't wait to come back again :=)"
"It has been many years since I last visited, but my recent visit has made a huge impression. It has only got better with time. This is a world class zoo comparable to the best. Take a relaxed stroll to savour every corner. Definitely worth an entire day. I would not recommend riding on the tram, unless you are in a real hurry."
"We were expecting something great based on what we heard and we were not disappointed....Beautiful setting , you have not really the feeling animals are in the cages and often it seems they can walk where you are. A lot of different animals. Very relaxing"
Feels like having a real holiday while spending time here.One of the most well-maintained zoos I've ever visited.A must to visit when in Singapore.
"A big zoo with lots of animals. They are allowed around people- the orangutans in particular swing above the heads of visitors- and there are regular feeding times. There are also water parks for children, and wild monitor lizards venturing out of the reservoir to have a look around!"
"With the virus numbers are restricted for entrance. This made the visit even better because we were able to view all the animals with out having to wait in queue, as sometimes happens.some areas are under cover to shelter from the heat. The animals all look contented and well cared for. A nice family outing. Food and drink is available for purchase."
"I have not been to the zoo in Singapore for a long time.We chose the zoo for our anniversary cum my birthday end of July since we are not able to go out of Singapore.The zoo is such a beautiful place to visit. We are not disappointed. In fact we are very pleased with our choice.The surroundings and animal exhibits are very well taken care of. The place is neat and the landscape beautiful. Walking around the zoo is so pleasant and make animal learning, funHere are some photos taken..."
"Beautiful and ethical zoo with spacious habitats for the well cared for animals. Fun to walk around and also take the train to see all the animals.Huge zoo so plan on spending lots of time. Consider prioritizing what animals you would like to see, as you might not have enough time and energy to walk around and spend time with all of them.The orangutan aerial habitat is amazing, they swing through the trees right over head, the only habitat of its kind in the world. You can take photos with them at certain times and also feed elephants and other animals.The daily schedule and map is your friend!"
"Many animal. Eat drink ok also, not so exp.Now covid must support.But if u hot, place not for u, go jewel better"
Singapore Zoo is a excellent place for people to learn how the animals carry out their daily routines.
"Wow what an amazing place, this must be the best zoo i have ever visitied. Animals have fantastic areas and everyone here is super friendly"
Lovely experience kids had a lovelyvtime in the play area. Staff try their best to get everyone 8nvolved in all activities.
"I've been to the Singapore zoo a few times and always had fun. Animal enclosures are well maintained, but most viewing areas are unsheltered and is scorching on sunny days.Food wise, there's an aircon restaurant and a non aircon bistro inside, selling mostly local foods like chicken rice, laksa and indian food. Honestly, prices are rather steep, but what do u expect from a touristy place? Good thing those with annual membership get a 20% discountThe park has numerous drinks vending machines & a fresh orange juice machine as well, but 1 cup of orange juice priced at $3 is $1 more than what is sold outside. We also saw a kiosk manned by a friendly staff selling drinks, pizza and snacks. There's also a KFC & a small cafe selling ice cream in the kids play area.It's quite a large park, so tram rides come in handy, especially if you are bringing small kids.Items sold at the gift shop are quite affordable and cute too"
"We ended up spending about 7 hours at the zoo, from 9am to around 4pm. There was so much to see and do. Sometimes you visit a zoo and feel the animals don't have enough space, or that the space provided to them just isn't appropriate for their needs but Singapore Zoo had a really nice naturalistic feel to it.The zoo has chosen to house their animals in open environments, choosing to restrict movement through things like moats, rather than cages and it just seems to provide a better environment for both animal and visitor.Despite visiting in a prime time the zoo wasn't crowded, I never felt I had to fight someone for a space to see something and we were able to take our time leisurely strolling around."
The way the zoo is set up is excellent. The animals are easy to see. there are good places to eat as well. Well worth the trip out
The zoo is still my all time favourite. Nature wild life are the best with every angle of the animal looking different at different times.
"Love to be here again and again, specially with small kids, they enjoy a lot, what I liked about this place is that animals are treated nicely and all of them look healthyTry to plan your trip so that you don't miss fabulous shows and buy tickets in a combination which can help pay less, try to buy online"
"The ground is very well-kept. Animals are also being treated very well. It is worth to spend the whole day here. If you have time, do the night safari, too."
"Just to big to cover all animals. It was educational for the young and adult. The weather is too humid, dress down in order to spend longer here."
"The Singapore Zoo is an amazing place to visit especially when u really want to see animals. There is no need to go the Bird Park or the River Safari or the Night Safari! When u enter the zoo u see the Ah Meng Restaurant and the Tram Station 1. You see tigers, lions, elephants, rhinoceros, birds also, giraffe, African painted dog, zebra, ostrich, otter..... { YOU WILL FIND OUT WHEN U VISIT!! } I recommend all travelers to visit this place because it is in Singapore and it is fully green."
Singapore zoo has lots of cool and rare animals including the white tiger . And Singapore zoo even has farm animals. I highly recommend going there
"Due to limited guest allowed, zoo was not crowded and it was pleasant to spend quality time with the family there.Place is well maintained and good educational trip for the kids."
"A very relaxing journey. Great day out for the family, nice place where you can see all kinds of animals."
Bring my kids down to learn about animals in Singapore. Start teaching them at young age to let them have more exposure
The Singapore Zoo is one of the most amazing zoos i have ever been to i loved how you had close interaction with all the animlas and especially in the butterfly enclosure would love to re visit this zoo in the future
I was visiting that place a few time during the day and i like it even more at night safari!It is a very big place so you better follow the map!It can get very hot during the day so be ready!cheers!
Singapore Zoo is a must go attraction place when you visit Singapore. Went there during phase 2 of Circuit Breaker. Need to book time slot for safety measures. Enjoy with less crowded environment.
"This is the best zoo I have ever been to, and I have been to the San Diego zoo. When my parents came to visit Singapore I made it a point to bring them here. The pandas, PANDAS, were both out and so precious. Love this place so much that my husband and I have season passes and have sponsored the chubbiest little Malay Sunbear."
"Without a doute, this was the best part of my whole trip to Singapore and I urge anyone visiting to take a day out to go to the zoo. I used public transport to get there and back. Many of the animals are roaming around freely with very open areas making it feel like you are practically in the enclosures while staying safe. The animals are well looked after and its just a fantastic day out!"
"My wife and I are animal lovers. We fell in love with the Singapore Zoo all over again, after decades since either of us step foot inside! We long to show some love to the animals there after the months of closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. When this iconic attraction finally reopened, we signed up for the limited slots available on a Sunday. To our pleasant surprise, there were no crowds despite it being a weekend. The zoo has done a great job in terms of safe distancing: staggered limited entries, shows limited strictly to 50 pax (with ample separation between groups), and ambassadors around at popular exhibits to ensure there is no overcrowding. Not all the exhibits were open, for example Frozen Tundra was closed, I assume due to it being an enclosed space. However, we enjoyed the vast majority of exhibits that were open. We especially loved that the animals had ample space to roam around. We were so amused by the friendly monkeys and beautiful butterflies that came really up close to us too! This zoo is very kid-friendly too, so we saw lots of families. Just be prepared to spend several hours there to cover all the exhibits; there can be a lot of walking involved but at least the tree cover provided good shade. We hope to be back again!"
This is such an awesome zoo! Highly recommend visiting often. The tram is great but it's an easy zoo to walk and explore. You can get close to the animals and it's just so clean and well-run!!!
"Great variety of animals and have an option to get introduced to them, I loved to way animals are kept in the zoo"
"One bright spot during the Covid-19 outbreak is the lack of crowding at popular attractions. In July, 2020 my wife, son and I booked a mid-afternoon start time (caution: the Zoo closes at 6 p.m.) and risked getting rained on. On a Tuesday afternoon, we never had more than five people within view (sole exception: Reptile House). The animals were less spooky, with the highlight being two giraffes which walked up to within five meters of my son. It was a great viewing experience.Not everything is great, however. The tram doesn't run, so wear comfortable shoes. Almost all F&B outlets are closed, too, so drink water before you enter (or carry it with you). About 5% of the exhibits/animals enclosures are under renovation and the animals aren't on display. But none of those drawbacks detracted from an overall great experience."
"Took a buggy tour of the zoo today at 130pm and we were not disappointed! Has an excellent guide called Sean driving the buggy and taking us around, and him knowing all the animals and their names and their quirks made the experience very enjoyable. Had a great time petting tortoises and feeding giraffes. Will definitely recommend. Guide helped us to take photos and also provided wet wipes and sanitizer for us each time after we pet the animals. A wonderful day! Wanted to give the guide Sean a tip but he declined to accept. Great guy who just loves his job."
"There are only three places to visit in Singapore and the Singapore Zoo is one of them. I visit the zoo about once a year and every time I am there I ask myself why I don't visit earlier. It is hard to find a zoo that give the animals under their watch so much care. They are healthy and treated with respect. The shows are fun but what really is great is just walking around and soaking in the environment for yourself. It is great for the kids and always worth an early morning visit if you're short on time. There is a tram if you want to give the legs a rest, but if you are able just take your time and visit the animal enclosures one by one. Speaking of walking, the River Safari, Bird Park and Night Safari are all within walking distance should you want a super adventure and visit all four."
"Singapore Zoo is very nice place and properly arranged zoo for all species of animals. This place was more like a sanctuary where animals were free to move around. Additionally, proper care were taken care to animals were kept all of them healthy, we didn't see any animal in malnutrition-ed state, this is the specialty of Wildlife Reserves Singapore."
"We visited the Singapore Zoo after returning from our Southeast Asia cruise. We haven't visited many zoos, but of the ones we have visited, this one was by far, the BEST! We opted to walk around on our own during the late morning/early afternoon and spent about 3 to 4 hours at the zoo. We could tell the animals are so well-cared for. We fed the elephants, which was such a neat experience given that we didn't have time to go to the elephant sancutary while visiting Phuket (next time!). We had the opportunity to see so many ""different"" animals that we've never seen at any other zoo we've been to in the U.S. (such as the Bronx Zoo and Phoenix Zoo). The grounds of the zoo are truly GORGEOUS, and we wish we could have spent more time here. Being there was a very serene & peaceful experience."
Wonderful experience. There are many shows. It is comparable to sea world of San Diego. Excellent for family fun.
"Singapore Zoo is one of the most attractive place to visit in Singapore. It is protective, safe and secure, clean, attractive and full of activities. The best thing that I like is that it is very fun, enjoyable and Eco-friendly to animals. Singapore Zoo Staff is putting their best efforts to keep the animals alive in an Eco-friendly place. They treat the animals very kindly and softly. They are not harsh to animals.I have visited this place many times because I love animals though they may be wild animals."
"Love the structure of the Zoo , best to spread 2 days to visit the other 2 parks just beside ( River Safari & Night Safari ) the place is great for kids and all ages with good transportation in the park to visit from station to station and is handicapped friendly ."
It was interesting and fun to explore the different types of animals and the performances put up for us. There is also a small waterpark that kids can enjoy with Kfc just around the corner.
It's a great place to spend time. The zoo has a lot of open areas and the enclosures for the large animals. Great variety of animals and the events are educational focusing on conversation and environment in addition to entertain. My friend and I personally enjoyed the whole experience in the zoo. :)
"This zoo is very well organised. It covers a very large area, so comfy shoes needed! There is a free buggy service that can be picked up along the way and takes you to the next section. The selection of animals is extensive. A must do is to go on the river safari (which costs extra) where you get to see various amazing fish and other marine life and then finally you get to see the Panda's. If you are lucky you will get to see them eating and moving about just as we did!"
"Another absolute must, seeing nocturnal animals in their active state, while you ride a tram through the park. Great experience ."
"this zoo was so excited, actually it was a long lime ago i went to the zoo,it was so fun and so big that i can't visit all of the place."
"What an incredible place! Even as two grown adults without kids, we spent the whole day exploring the zoo. This was a world class zoo. We loved seeing the Panda Bears in the River Safari."
The Zoo is quite large so plan enough time to visit. The animals all look really happy and there's enough information (not too much) to learn something new.
"Our visit to the Zoo was part of Breakfast with the Orangutans. We loved the Zoo, but unless you have small children, I'd skip the breakfast and spend more time in the park. It is a great zoo and we saw nearly all of it. It has great open exhibits, including a couple like the Australian Outback where we had Wallabies hop right next to us. The animals were active and the environment was open that provide you great opportunists to see them as they live in the wild, especially the hippo and naked mole rat. In addition the setting of the zoo is a beautiful rainforest on the banks of a water reservoir, where you can see native animals that aren't in cages. Coming out of the reptile exhibit we saw a wild 2.5' monitor lizard that was a highlight for us.Still, while great, I can not say it is a lot better that other zoos. I will say if you only have time to make one visit out to the zoo area, go to the Night Safari. The experience you have at night is unique and can not be replicated other places. The zoo is just as good, but the experience at night is so unique and different."
"The Singapore Zoo has a fine collection of animals. Many are so acclimated to the heat that they're out and about at mid-day, something you don't often see. But what raises my rating from 4 to 5 stars has nothing to do with the animals. There's a kids' play area with fountains, showers and the like that's a hoot for both small children and their minders."
Got to feed Growy the giraffe - made my visit as this is what I specifically came to do. Typical Singaporean perfection with attention to standards lacking in most zoo's around the world. Animals are kept in top notch enclosures and seem genuinely happy to people watch. Its like we humans are they're zoo. The animals were very interested in us at almost every exhibit. This is a sure sign of there contentment.
"Singapore zoo has been one of the pioneer in designing zoo that resemblance a natural setting for its inhabitants.In 2022 the Singapore zoo, Night Safari, Bird park will all be located in the same vicinity. Look forward to this new park."
"Loved this zoo. The park itself was incredibly tidy and well maintained. The exhibits for the animals were a good size as well. The park itself was easy to get around and had plenty of vending machines if you got thirsty along the way. Overall, Singapore Zoo is a great family attraction for all. Highly recommend!"
"Had a spare day so ventured north to visit the zoo. Must admit I'm not a big fan of zoos as I would rather see animals in thier natural enviroment rather than in a cage. This zoo certainly changes one opinion and you can see from the very beginning why it has been voted the world's best zoo several years running. Animals have plenty of room (apart from the cheetah) to move around and are obviously well kept. Everything is spotlessly clean, plenty of water fountains, restaurants and all well signposted. It is a bit of a trek to get there but worth it"
"Beautiful zoo with so many animals. A massive variety of creatures from all over the world, presented to public view with complete respect. I spent the whole day there cause i wanted to see each and every animal. And also attended couple of shows...some are fun!"
"For many years one of my greatest desires was to visit the Singapore Zoo, a desire kicked off by a TV programme called 'Wild Island'. The visit fulfilled all my expectations. A massive variety of creatures from all over the world, presented to public view with complete respect and regard for their health and welfare. The enclosures were scaled to the natural, specific needs of each creature. Sections have been created to reflect the wildlife of countries or related species in different locations worldwide. The individual and enormous creative attention given to the creation of enclosures such that every visitor has ample viewing, the easy walking paths with resting areas providing toilet facilities as well as food and drink options, the diverse methods used to convey information, the obvious contentment of the animals, and the helpfulness of staff are most impressive. We must have walked kilometres but enjoyed ourselves so much that we didn't feel in the least fatigued. I felt a deep satisfaction!"
Great place to visit for Adults and children.Easy to walk around.Great tropical enclosures for the animals.Shutter for those who get tied.Allow at least half a day
"We enjoyed our visit so much. The vegetation and plants make this a wonderful botanic garden as well as a fabulous zoo. The volunteers we met were so helpful and caring and we were so pleased with the animal welfare standards. Well done Singapore and what a wonderful effort you are making to get the message of conservation over to those who need most to know most! Keep up your mavalous work, anyone who does not approve of zoos should visit yours!"
"You will be unlucky person if you miss zoo, night safari, birdpark, river safari visit in Singapore trip.world's best zoo with inside tram facility, first you get Map from enternce gate and look for number 1 tram station and then you just rom around all station by tram and observe with map. then you start your favorite animal visit. In Map you will get all info about restaurant, show times etc. so don't miss any shows specifically. tram ride you can do unlimited arrive early at zoo at opening time and finish all area till 5.30 then you have to exit and just cross road you will be at night safari. i m sharing very few photos pls don't judge it by photos there is huge difference between photo and your own eye experience. * dont miss any show in zoo**"
"You get the geniume feeling of wildlife. Animal keepers show so much care and attention to each one of the animals they are in charge. The best orangutans installation in the world, they move freelly almost around the whole zoo.The spectables are really worth seeing: the highest respest to ALL animal.Singapore zoo is a clear example of what and how zoos shoud be."
"An outstanding zoo with outstanding exhibits. Well laid out and easy to find your way around with the guide map. The variety and excellence of all the exhibits exceeded our expectations, which were high, given the reputation held by the zoo.The White Tiger was sensational, as was the Reptile exhibit.A great place for a family or couples to enjoy a day out."
Amazing shows including the rainforest and elephant shows. But the highlight of the day was definitely seeing the orangutans swinging overhead and to see them come down for the feeding time. Highly recommend!
The zoo was still quite crowded yesterday (15 March 2020) despite the virus situation in SG. Lots of babies and families at this zoo. Overall a great trip!
"From the arrival hall to the modern ticket procurement n issuance, and the layout of the zoo is just great. Lots of interesting bits n pieces everywhere. The only disappointment is the snacking points. Hehehe"
It's been years that we have not visited this place. Seeing the growth of animals population make us delighted.Just a bit annoyed by the construction going on the zoo.
This zoo is very interesting. The environment seems to suit the wide range of animals etc. Worth adding on the sealife/pandas too.
"Singapore's zoo is a gorgeous zoo that you will find hard to believe is in a city! They have a little train that you can taken a tour around on but the walking paths are excellent. It is very tropical, super clean and the animals have lots of space to wander in. Restaurants and gift shops on site. An enjoyable place to spend the day!"
"We've been to zoos all over the world, and this one is definitely up there. For admission, we got the 4 park pass (includes the river zoo, bird park and night zoo) which seems to be good value. As you walk in, they give you a map and it's pretty easy to find your way around. Given the time of visit, there was screening for coronavirus, which made us feel a bit safer.It's key to line up the times with animal feedings. They have a 'tour' where they go around and feed about 5 different animals in a 30 min window. It's great, as you get a commentary on the animals you're looking at, while looking at them up close and while they are active.The animal variety was great, saw an awesome mix of all kinds of animals. It's great that they seemed to be well taken care of. The highlights for us were the elephants (they have so many!), chimps and orangutans.To get there, we got the SMTR (train) to khabib and then the shuttlr bus from there that comes every 20 mins. Would advise buying the card if you're going to use the SMTR often while in Singapore. With the card, it was $1.60 ish to get there, and another $1 for the shuttle, and the range coming back.Overall it's pretty much a must visit while in Singapore, they have the river cruise next door so if you get the multi pass, beneficial to do both on the same day. Go early to make sure you see everything though!"
The zoo is just amazing very well maintained and a lot of Different Animal Species are there . My daughter loved it to the core . The best Part is the different Shows they Conduct . Would reccommend to attend the shows as well .You will need an entire Day to cover this and the River Safari next to it.
lot's of varities of animals for the kids to see and enjoy. The shows are also very entertaining. One of the cleanest zoo in the world.
Kids loved this zoo. What was also nice was when the kids got a bit tired there was a splash pad where they could run and play.
Very nice zoo to visit even if you are not a fan of these places. Nature is omnipresent and very beautiful and worth seeing just for that.
Singapore zoo is truly one of the worlds greatest zoo. A large range of animals. A really beautiful park. And we got to feed the elephants by hand. A bit of walking. For children i suggest a stroller or buy tram tickets.
Great day out.Thoroughly recommend the animal feeding. Fed a giraffe and it only cost $5 for the experience of a lifetime.White tiger is pretty cool too.Loads of animals to see and the shows are pretty good too.
There is a large variety of animals to be seen including some live shows. Give yourself plenty of time to see all the animals and recommend buying a reasonably priced ticket to the hop on hop off zoo shuttle- saves a ot of walking time. Really enjoyed the exhibits including an area where birds and some invertebrates walked around freely. There are strategically placed cafes around the zoo if you get thirsty or hungry. We travelled to and from the zoo using Uber equivilant- was also good value for five adults.
An exceptional experience. Night show with people and animals. And an entertainment roller coaster ride along the night lanes between the animals
A fantastic zoo with a great range of animals. Particularly enjoyed the Orangutans. Very educational and well worth a visit
"The best zoo I've ever been too. very clean, and I really liked how they cared the animals they have in there."
"The animals are well looked after , plenty of room for them almost home from home , do see the pandas and the red pandas. If you are in Singapore for a week or more get a yearly pass as I guarantee you will want to go back especially if you have children, it gets very hot but there are plenty of sheltered and air conditioned areas. I know people object to zoo's but it has a world renown breeding process to return animals to the wild but as the slaughter of animals in the wild continues we have to have well maintained accommodation for them ."
Well-maintained facilities and lots of animals to see and learn. Some packages include the Tram Ride but we did not use it since you really need to walk to see all the animals.
"Being a anew Yorker I'm familiar with Bronx Zoo and have also been to the one in Dan Diego. Both of,these are recognized as being at the top of the list.The Singapore Zoo is smaller in size than these two but is also of Ex ceptionally high quality with a wide variety of animals to see mainly in their native habitats.Unfortunately a few exhibits were under renovation and were closed to the public but overall this is a professional facility and a good way to spend the day.Be sure to take the shuttle to get around."
Really amazing place!Was awesome day in zoo. Child was very happy to see so many exotic animals!Thank you
"My boyfriend and I visited Singapore Zoo on Feb. 28th, 2020. We arrived via Mandai Khatib Shuttle bus at around 8:30am and purchased tickets for the Park Hopper Plus (SGD95). This included entry to all four parks which are: Jurong Bird Park, Night Safari, Singapore Zoo and River Safari. Our visit included everything except Jurong Bird Park since we found out at the ticket booth that this area was not actually on site with the other areas, but about a 20 minute drive away. We plan to visit again sometime this year to see it.Upon entering the Singapore Zoo, the first thing we noticed was how clean and well maintained it was, despite there being lots of people and animals there all the time. It's hot and humid most of the time in all of the parks so wear light, breathable clothing. Mosquitos live in the zoo as well so if you're prone to bites like me, I highly encourage you to apply some sort of repellent before entering. You could also do what I did and bring a small bottle of OFF! spray to carry with you for touch ups through out the day. We saw plenty of animals and got our fair share of walking done in this area. The River Safari had lots of marine life to see and we enjoyed the Amazon River Quest ride a lot. The 15 minute Reservoir Cruise was an enjoyable way to relax, take in the scenery and learn a bit of history about the area. At the Night Safari, it was very difficult to see things but we enjoyed the experience of doing a late night walk while taking some photos of the animals we could see. Some of our favorite animals to see from each zoo were: Cheetahs, penguins and white tigers from the Singapore Zoo. Giant panda, red panda and jaguar from the River Safari. Tiger, giant hippo and servals from the Night Safari.Overall, we loved our first trip to this zoo and would definitely recommend it as a wonderful place to spend a day with the entire family, friends or partners. Other zoos will find it hard to compete and this zoo will always be one of our favorite places to recommend for travelers who are coming to see Singapore for the first time."
Singapore Zoo is a paradise for nature lovers.. u can find all types of animals here. The best part they are located on large patch of the habitat. U will not feel that they are caged. You feel like they are in their natural habitat.
"Really loved this zoo. So many different animals but not just that the experience you get in different areas and the views were fantastic. Its a must visit location, there are areas where you can roam around inside and the animals are loose walking and jumping around you. There was a bat eating just a metre away from where we stood. The butterfly dome was also amazing where they would fly around you. Lots more other areas also. The restaurant food was also very good and reasonably priced where alot of zoos charge a fortune for sub standard food. Separate to seeing the animals alot of the areas talk about the cruelty animals suffer in different countries. Please take time to read some of the postings, as an animal lover I really appreciate that the zoo has taken steps to educate us in animal cruelty. I really hope Singapore does more to help animals. Please visit."
"Great way to spend the day in Singapore, started with a breakfast with the orangutan followed by a day of enjoying animals from all around the country, fortunate for us much quieter then normal due to the lack of Chinese tourist. Would recommend for family."
"This zoo is amazing! IT has so many different variety of animals from all around the world. Despite the limited area of the zoo, the representation of the species is truly global. Animals on the endangered species list are well supported and even bred offsprings. The visit is not just about expecting to see many animals of the same species, but it is about being an engaging experience as much as possible for each and every species where permissible. This is not a safari, yet the environment is brought to the visitors as close as possible. From a visitors point of view is fantastic. (Put must have dolphins or the polar bear that lived for a very long time there aside) However, from the animal itself living in a controlled habitat has its advantages and disadvantages. Protection of the species survival is the utmost, however, this seemed to cost the animal the required area for roaming, thriving and animal socialising within the animal species and inter-social with other animals. Although well, looked after, the animals seemed to lack enough space/area - after all this is a form of captivity. Most animals have lost their ability to hunt and find they home for survival.Still, this zoo is one of the best I have seen. All continents are represented. Making fun out of the zoo is also Singapore's greatest gift to attracting visitors to a calm, safe and hassle free zoo environment. Worth a visit and certainly all the attractions cannot be seen in a day - such and amazing design to a small area. With the adjacent attractions, allocate at least three good (weather) days to wander the zoo and surrounding attractions.This visit is highly recommended. Start the visit when the gate opens to get the most out of it, even for multiple visits."
The location and layout is excellent and almost all the species seem well accommodated and unstressed. My favourite has to be the area where you can walk among the butterflies then in the area with miniature deer and fruit bats etc.
One of the best zoos in the world. Kids enjoyed and animals are really taken care of. Visit every few years
"Loved the zoo. We stayed much longer than expected, about 5 hours. You get really up close and personal with many of the animals, especially in their monkey part. It was cool."
"Maybe the best zoo we have ever visited, glad to see that animals are well treated and the surroundings are in order. Reserve time as it is needed ...."
You just go there and see yourself the beauty of this zoo with all the attractions they have! We enjoyed every momment. You can buy online the tickets cheaper!
"We visited the zoo in Feb with my grandaughter and it was amazing.The animals were in huge enclosures with excellent viewing. The white tigers were fed while we were there and seeing them jump in the water was quite a sight. There was a large selection of animals to see and it took all day to walk around it all.Our favourite was to be there when the Orangutans were fed and you could literally be standing next to them . There was a wet play area which was ideal for youngsters to cool down , so take a swimming costume.This zoo is as good as any I have visited and made a nice day away from the busy city. We got a taxi to get there which was the easiest way and reasonably priced."
"I remembered the Singapore zoo being on of my favourite zoos in the world! With the Covid-19, there were limited seatings for the shows due to safe distancing. We didn't go for any of the shows as it was fully filled 30 minutes before the shows started. We bought tickets at $37.50 for the zoo and river safari (promotion at 50%, not too sure when it'll end).The zoo probably take about half a day to completion and we didn't get to see every animals (maybe just 2 or 3 left?). Other than that, everything was ok. Information were well written so people who are interested in animals can obtain sufficient knowledge at the zoo! :)Overall, is a good time spent with my family but I probably will visit many years later? Not too sure."
"I have been to the zoo many times but during my last visit, I was with my grandchildren between the ages of 4 months to 6 years old. They were very excited especially when they were very close to the animals at the butterfly park. The new water dispenser is great new feature. During this COVID period this is fantastic."
The Zoo is quite big so you will need at least half a day to enjoy everything at your own paste. May eateries and animal shows.
"Great place to relax and have fun with the kids. There is a tram ride that goes around the zoo and allows you to see most of the animals and exhibits while sitting comfortably on a spacious seat in a tram with safe distancing but masks are mandatory for the whole trip. Feedings and shows are fun but limited seating and fewer than normal times due to Covid 19 measures. Overall, my son 7, loves it and we visit at least once a quarter..."
"A great zoo to visit, the animal enclosures are open and natural and it's easy to get around and find things. The animal shows are mostly good, however the cat and dog show wasn't worth waiting for. It's worth getting a ticket that includes the shuttle, it makes it a lot easier to get around, especially on a hot, sticky Singapore day. Getting to the zoo is super easy, head to Khatib MRT and take the Mandai Zoo shuttle straight to the zoo. Definitely worth a visit."
"Different animals come out at night, so this is a very different view We enjoyed train ride and the show. Come early! There's so much to see. Also if you fly Singapore Air you get a discoundt"
"If you love spending time with animals and enjoy their company a lot, then this is a must-go place for you.The imagination for Zoo is always to watch the animals in a cage and watch them from a distance in their natural habitat. But interactions with the animals in the zoo make you feel otherwise and give you a very pleasant experience.One must take almost half day for this activity, the HOHO buses will take you to this place, but they have a special route so if you plan to go by those buses then 6-7 hours is what you should eye on.It is a wonderful place and one can enjoy with family, friends and loved ones.Cheers"
Singapore zoo is one of the best zoo I have ever visited. The most interesting part of the zoo are their shows.They happen twice in the morning and post lunch.
"We loved the Singapore zoo, beautiful animals, nice enclosures. We didn't get much time as we went to the river safari first, but we still enjoyed it. Don't miss the sea lion show, my kids (6 and 9 years) loved it, sit in the front couple of rows to get wet by the sea lion (be there early if the zoo is crowded). Take towels and swim clothes for the kids as there is a splash zone at the zoo. Watch your kids closely, there are animals everywhere they could step on or disturb, and don't let kids climb the handrails of the bridge near the zoo entrance, there are huge crocodiles in water below!"
"we caught the MRT and a bus to get here. take your singapore airlines boarding pass with you and get a discount on entry, The zoo is a large area and takes a bit of time to get around. Duck into the reptile enclosure for some aircon comfort if needed. The first show starts at 10.00am so get there before it starts."
"Had breakfast with Orangutan family. Buffet & tables were a bit tight to get around, but all other areas of the zoo were accessible with wheelchair. Took the little bus train around the zoo, but had to store chair ourselves in front of our legs which was uncomfortable, even though it was not to capacity. Lots of walking for your carer."
"It's a zoo, and it's one of the best we been to. Well liad out with really informative display panels and all well maintained. Very clean and all animals were healthy and happy in spacious enclosures. Getting around was easy on shuttle circuit that you simply got on and off at regular stops.Plenty of food and drink outlets so easy to take time out from the exhibits. Allow a full day. Then if you want more you can do the night visit for a completely different experience. Again we had no waiting no ques as the corona virus scare meant tourist numbers were way down. Great for us..."
"What a great Zoo to visit, we were able to get a close look at the animals and feel like we were on safari.Well organised, clean, friendly staff."
"It was always new to me, even though my family have been there for so many years. They have ""live shows"", which my son loves it so much."
The Singapore Zoo has always prided itself for maintaining a well laid out zoo with sufficient animals to interest set within a natural space next to a reservoir. They adopt good zoology principles like ensuring that the animals receive good nutrition as well as stimulation.There are sufficient rest points and the natural setting enables the visitor to appreciate the lush jungle surrounding it. The children's zoo is a popular stop as are the animal shows. Access to the zoo is easy and it should always be a must-visit place for any visitor.
"Night safari was good but probably did not match my expectation as not many of the animals were out. Have to say staff were fantastic though, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful"
"Such a great Zoo to come and spend a day out at, went a watched a great bird show with some other walking and swinging animals also got to see the first ever otter show as well, feeding the animals was another great addition Singapore Zoo have as well and it's great that it lets the kids get involved, my favourite animal to feed was both the elephant and giraffe, was entertaining walking past and seeing orangutang's swinging overhead on ropes and seeing the little ones learning and leaping from one rope to another, would definitely recommend going to Singapore Zoo for a day out"
"My young bro liked so much to feed animals and take a close look of animal.My parents also enjoyed with the animals,their act."
Heavenly for an animal lover. Might get boring and tiring if you aren't fond of animals. Reached late so couldn't complete the whole zoo tour but still managed to see some amazing species for the first time.
I visited the zoo some 20+ years ago so decided to do a night time visit. It is a bit time constraining as it takes a while to get to it to via the trains - 45 mins or so from Marina Bay area.I would certainly recommend a daytime visit to take a gentle walk around without having to rush.
"Not generally a zoo visitor but heard good things about Singapore Zoo so decided we would take a look. We were lucky enough to have two young guides training on conservation from school for the first ten minutes of our trip and they were so knowledgeable. The zoo itself is beautiful, clean, seems very well run and the animals have plenty of natural style habitat in which to live."
"The Animal collections here are good, some cages/open grounds are kept well. the Staffs are really helpful and suggestive. We had change to visit all of the attractions here including the night Safari.i would recommend this place for kinds and Family, the cages can be more clean and attractive."
I enjoyed seeing the animals up close and the tram we traveled on was much closer than I had imagined.
We went to the zoo during the day and then stayed for the night safari. The zoo itself was okay but we thought that we had visited better zoos. The night safari however was quite unique and something very different. So we would recommend that you just go to the night safari if you want a unique experience.
The singapore zoo is very good and also very interesting for children - can spend the full day there - must bring water for the kids as about too hot in the afternoonGreat place for the weekend
We spent the all day and we enjoyed the zoo very much. You must go before 10 o'clock to be able to see all the shows available
"Kids will enjoy , as the zoo has almost all the animals, but need to walk a lot. If you are having a toodler, please be prepared. The tram facility is available in zoo, there are some shows in zoo , like feeding time of animals , that could be enjoyable."
it's a big enough place to spend a day with a family or as a lone wolf.Pros:- A lot of animals- Short and interesting descriptions- Real size animated statues of extinct species- Playgrounds and entertainments for kids- Food and drink- Car parkCons:- Trams can be very busy sometimes (photo attached)- Frozen Tundra attraction has a very inaccurate world map. It has a non existing country or a continent called European Union (photo attached)- Some animals are difficult to spot when they are hiding from the scorching Sun
"Go early for more sights, and that means around 9-10am. It's less warm and animals are more active. You get to feed them by paying a token (say $5), and you can get a friend to snap a photo for you. It's pretty accessible - board the Zoo/Night Safari bus from Khatib train station. It will cost $2 per way and payable by your travel card i.e. EZ Link card. Head to the zoo before River Safari."
"This is definitely a great place for kids with a wide variety of species and animals. But somehow I felt this place was bit hyped and overly crowded. Probably, you will rate this zoo as average, if you have ever visited one like the San Diego zoo."
"alot of things to see. it is a pity that it rained on the day i visited, i will want to return to see the rest"
"I visited this zoo few days ago.This was my first visit to this Zoo. Compared to many zoos I have visited, one thing I noticed is that the animals in Singapore Zoo are very well treated. They have more space and also the zoo is very clean.This zoo does have decent number of species. We went on a weekday so it was not crowded as well. Which allowed us to roam freely relaxing.We experienced a bit of rain, but it stopped in about 10 minutes, so it was not an issue for us. If it had rain longer, it would have been an issue for the visitors because I did not notice much shades around the zoo to find a cover.There were some nice artificial animals with some movements, which is a nice addition too.Overall, I think it is a good place to visit, specially, if you like to see and learn about animals."
The Zoo is really big with a variety of animals. It also has restaurants and souvenir shops. It is divided into section depending on the spieces you want to see. Do not miss the breakfast with chimpazees (extra cost) and the animals feed time.
"Free maps provided upon entranceSigns easy to follow & understandLimited shade from weather if towards the far end of the zooMany people congregated at shaded areasShow timings clearly indicated on mapsTransport areas and timings clearly markedLimited food options available, slightly pricey"
We spent about 3 hours walking the Singapore Zoo and were constantly amazed at its fantastic set up and design. Seeing the orang-utans climbing above you on ropes was ingenious. Theres renovations currently so parts of the zoo are close to the noise but its not too distracting.
Initially at the Zoo for the Orangutan BreakfastThe entrance to the zoo is pretty with the flowering Orchid arches. and then there's the lovely Koi Carp pond by the external Cafe'sLook up into the trees and check out any swing nets in the trees above the public walk ways for the Orangutans.The Zoo is pristine clean and well set out and clearly sign posted along the path ways.Arrange your time for interactive feedings with the animals (this does cost a small fee)The animal habitats are nicely designedThe Zoo is worth a visit allow sufficient time of several hours for your visit.The gift shop is located near the turn stiles of entry & exit of the Zoo. The shops are worth a peruseThere is good taxi services outside the Zoo to take you back to your hotel.
"On our last trip, we wandered around the zoo and just happened to be at the Orangutans when they were feeding them. this time we booked to have breakfast with them. We arrived early and were given a good seat. The breakfast itself was excellent - many things to choose from. Seeing the Orangutans was a bit disappointing. We weren't very close to them at all and it was hard to get good photos as they just wanted to eat. I think visiting their enclosure is just as good.The zoo itself is amazing still. We paid for the tram ride which was great not having to walk around in the heat. Singapore Zoo is still a must see."
"Enjoyable both for the kids and the kids at heart. Lots of animals in their natural habitat. Monkeys, giraffe, zebra etc. You can ride the tram unlimited for an additional 5$ to get you to different stations with less walking. There are also shows for the various animals which you can check and enjoy."
"A must visit, when in Singapore. They have tram facilities as well. Recommendation is to walk(if you are able to). The current set of shows were not great. The shows during my earlier visit was much better than the current set. It is a not a very big park, you should be able to cover it in 3-4 hrs with leisure pace."
"Great day out for animal lovers, lots of interesting exhibits and the splash show was worth waiting for."
"A nice day trip away from the city. We took a cab there around ~SGD 30 each way. ParkHopper + pass was worth it since we did three parks in one day (primary zoo, river safari, 7:20pm night safari, rainforest lumina). We got there at 1pm and left around 9pm. The zoo is terrific - the open design is pretty cool, especially for viewing the primates. River safari worth it just for seeing the manatees and pandas. Thunderstorms closed down the boat ride. Night safari a unique experience, especially seeing the big cats at night. Rainforest lumina a waste of time - best to avoid.If you don't have mobility issues avoid the tram at all costs. The zoo is not that big. You could probably walk to the other end in around 15-20 minutes with kids. If you wait at tram stop 1 and the line is full, you will waste 45 minutes standing around, and you can't see much from the tram."
This is a very good zoo with lots of different animals in various exhibits - some interactive where you can stroll in and around with the animals as well.Some enclosures the animals were not on display and no explanation given - the enclosures just looked empty.Would still recommend though
"We really enjoyed our day out at Singapore Zoo. Theres a lot of animals to see, and a lot of ground to cover, although not as big as we anticipated, definitely manageable. We found that the enclosures were very animal friendly and were much more open and animals looked free compared to other zoos. In terms of conservation they still need to do a bit of work with education. We found information about the animals quite minimal, and could do with more information (think London Zoo). The general organisation of the zoo was quite chaotic. We visited on a Monday, got tickets online to avoid queues, arrived at noon and found that a lot of people were arriving at that time and people were also finishing up their visit at that time. We found the staff at the restaurants to be quite miserable, and ran out of all vegetarian options. We also bought the tram pass but was unable to use it as the queues were quite ridiculous, people had been waiting 45mins, we tried several time to get in line and enquired about waiting times and was told 45mins at least. It's quite disappointing that they didn't have enough trams to deal with the demand. We also noticed that people were treating the transportation as a guide and not getting off. Often at the tram stops people were not getting off, so a tram would come by and no one could get on. This was frustrating and for us that we spent money on a service that was not properly organized. We also found that several drink / ice cream sellers had sold out of items along the way, we walked half way around the zoo and couldn't find ice cream at any store. I think SZ is missing a trick there. All in all it was a great seeing the amazing variety of happy looking animals in a great home. Definitely worth a visit."
I was pleased to see that there were water refill stations. This helps combat single use plastic. The grounds were well kept and I enjoyed the zoo very much. The animals seemed to be happy.We did came to both the zoo and the night safari. We did both the same day. I would suggest splitting it up into too because we were so exhausted by the end of the day that we didn't even walk around at the night safari and left shortly after it opened.
"Of all the zoos (San Diego, Bronx, Washington DC) the Singapore Zoo is the most impressive. The only disappointment was the food facilities. Overcrowded and the cleaning staff was totally overwhelmed by the crowds. Take the Metro and the bus. Very convenient and much cheaper than a taxi."
This is must go place if anyone is trying for a week or more and have an interest in animals ... recommendation is to plan entire trip in advance .. to match arrival and departure time with the shows ..Buying ticket online and buying a combination of ticket could give a cheaper options
"We started with the breakfast with the orangutans at the zoo. We booked with safari gate on line. Once at safari gate at Suntec city we boarded an open top bus to the zoo, $84ea was our transfer to & from the zoo, breakfast, zoo entrance & zoo tram. Unfortunately we got there just a tad late & the orangutans were already out, so it was rush to hurry & get in line for our photo. luckily it wasn't to busy so we didn't have to wait long. The professional photo is $35 in frame. While we were there the sunrise program was filming so we got caught up in that as we from Australia too. Breakfast was nice with various foods. After breakfast we headed straight for the giraffe feeding, $5 ea , this was so cute. It was hot & we did use the tram for some of the way as we skipped kidzania as our children are teenagers & we opted not to see the Australian animals. It's wonderful to see the monkeys roam above, on signs & in trees. We left about 1pm again on the safari gate bus as they leave every hour back to Suntec city. A delightful day spent at the zoo."
The first zoo I visited that actually is enjoyable to walk around. I was quite let down about the fewer variety of animals they had in or I just over expected. Very good experience overall with the zoo keepers showcasing a few animals.An enjoyable place for your child is you have any.
"The signages should be bigger so that they can be seen from a distance. On a sunny day, the place can be quite hot. More covered walkways should be built to provide good shelter."
A great place to visit for family especially for children.A big variety of animals to look at and most of them looked healthy.The zoo was very clean and have a few restaurants to choose from.It also has a small pool and playground for children.
"Normally, I personally am not that fond of zoos; most are on human terms and are just for enticing visitors to see spectacular animals in captivity. But then there are some who care about the survival of all species and who work actively for a living planet and who also teach as much knowledge as possible about the animals you take care of. This particular zoo seems to be among the better ones and they have an impressive content with all imaginable animals, mainly from tropical and subtropical sites, as well as a very educational design with elements of fantasy animals and even the occasional extinct species. Singapore Zoo is a little outside the city center, but you can get here by subway and bus in less than an hour."
"The actual zoo is the best I've been to; it's well worth the high end price to see so many animals roaming in large areas without nets and cages. The lack of barriers means you're closer to the animals and can get some great pictures (they use slopes, ditches and moats of water to prevent the animals from leaving their area).We also did the night safari which we didn't know was a completely different zoo! (Right next door). So if, like us, you're unsure whether to do one or the other- DO BOTH!The only negative I have is the shuttle bus service. We had to seek advice from the SMRT staff after so much confusion with the private zoo drivers. If you plan to use to shuttle service from the SMRT station here is how- You get on the bus WITHOUT a ticket (this is likely difficult as the drivers don't let you on until you argue and point at the sign saying 'pay on arrival', they speak no to little English so be persistent). When you arrive at the zoo, you pay for your ride there (and purchase a ticket for the way back). If, like us, you'll be returning for the night safari later, I'd suggest also buying the bus tickets for those rides to avoid the ticket hassle again. This is an extremely confusing and counter-productive way of operating a shuttle service and it leaves many tourists stranded and forced to pay high prices for taxis- please change it!"
"I suppose you could say that if you've seen one Zoo then you've seen them all. Not so in Singapore. This is a very well laid out Zoo that in the main is pretty flat. At this Zoo you get quite close to the animals and at times it seems like you could just reach out and touch them and you can at certain feed times - for a fee of course. We didn't. We left that for the young people to experience. There are animals from all over the world including a large Australian exhibit. I'm a big fan of Meerkats and Otters and I spent quite a bit of time at their exhibits.We used their ""tram system"" to get around the ground because this option not only helps the legs but it also enables you to see the entire zoo in segments We spent the entire at there starting at Zoo opening time and not leaving until around 4.30pm. Food is not cheap but quite tasty.It truly deserves a full day to gain the most out of this Zoo. We bought the park hopper option to see all four parks with a saving of 50% off the price of all four parks. Quite a bargain and you have a full week to use the pass.This Zoo should be a must see for all age groups."
"Alot of entertaining and informative show just follow the timing closely. The only area of improvement is to at least put up signs on where and what time the feeding trail will be as the area is large so that visitors will not be looking around and guessing where it will be and ended up missing out altogether. The food at Ah Meng restaurant is dissapointing and does not reflect the real taste of Singapore food. Please pack your own snacks , bring refillable bottles as there are water coolers strategically located all around."
We caught a taxi out there and cost about $30 approximately. Was cheaper on the way back for some reason. We hadnt been there for some years and noticed the new additions. Its a reasonable walk around the park and some hilly areas but wonderful animals to see. Worth a visit to see.
"Fun activities for kids at Kidzworld and rope courses. Great to have water refill stations in strategic locations in the park.The animal shows, same narrative but does not educate people on how to be more involve in animal conservations."
"Beautiful scenery and gardens, you get the feeling your in the animals environment rather than them being there for our entertainment, bring water, its quite a walk but self paced and very well laid out."
"My kids love the shows. Do arrive early to catch the 10am , 11am shows and head to the Children's Splash park (included in the tickets) . Next slow walk around the zoo. Very clean and family friendly environment. So expect long queue for food during peak season. And watch out or the monkeys that will grab your food if you are eating outside the KFC area of Spalsh park. Overall, a great experience. Do bring swim gears, extra change of clothes, insect repellent, and umbrellas (rainy season)."
"My wife and I visited Singapore zoo for the Night Safari adventure and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. From the tram ride around the zoo to the animal shows, the unique experience of visiting a zoo at night was great and highly recommended."
"This zoo is well maintained and affordable. Try to do the night safari and the lumina show, we really enjoyed it"
"We brought our sprightly birthday boy to the zoo and he loved every minute of it. Do note that there is free admission if it's your birthday and this deal is valid for 7 days from date of birth, actual date inclusive. Do refer to the website for more details.We have not been to the zoo in a long time and we were glad to see that the programs have been refreshed. There are now keepers' chit-chat sessions and animal feeding times scheduled throughout the day. This gives the visitors a more interactive experience rather than just looking at the animals going about their routine. The keepers' have good knowledge and are a friendly bunch.Rainforest Kidzworld: A must visit if you're bringing young children. My little one loved the pony ride, feeding the goats and bunnies in the buddy farm. Not to mention the ice cream break after that. However the young zoo staff at the buddy farm seemed a little jaded.We had time for 2 shows: The elephant presentation was educational but light hearted. Our children loved the way the elephants were playful with each other and when they could swallow an entire watermelon.The Splash Safari show was a disappointment though. The script was predictable and the jokes outdated. I remember that this was THE show at the Zoo but I suppose things have changed over the years.Access: We rented a wagon so the kids could last longer at the Zoo. If not we'd be hearing endless complaints about being tried from walking. So to a certain extent letting them ride in the wagon was also about their parents lasting longer in terms of sanity.Our day out is best described in my uploaded pics."
It's one of the best and well maintained Zoo in Singapore. It's must place visit if you are visiting Singapore with family.
Another amazing place to see in Singapore located about minutesoutside the city is the zoo and wildlife safari experience exotic animals and reptiles there is an entry fee
"The problem with Singapore zoo is that it seems a bit of a pain to get to it.It isn't directly on the metro and is the other side of the island. It is, however, worth doing (four to five hours will cover it).There is an express link from one metro station, but unhelpfully you need a cashless card that typically only the locals have. Other public transport is possible, but very time consuming.So some tips.A taxi is a very affordable option, especially if there are two or more of you.Peak travel in the morning from city hotel cost about S$26, and off-peak travel back to the city $18 - back in 20 mins.Yet on our return there were no taxis at the rank, so you have to get lucky. Your backup should be however the express bus (mentioned above). If you are at the zoo, you can buy a one off ticket (S$1) and use this service, but no-one mentions this as an option. So - taxi it there, bus and metro it back."
"The zoo as such is great. Lots of animals, very well maintained and organized.Would recommend doing it on a cool day. If you have kids who cannot walk a lot yet and not too crazy about animals, you can skip it.The sea lion show is very good. Do not miss that.Take the tram, you will use it. If you in excellent shape, then you can skip it!"
"We went to this Zoo via local transport. At the Orchard Rd MRT get rapid rail to ""Ang-Mo-Kio"" station. From there we caught a bus #138 that takes you directly to the Zoo. By purchasing a ""Singapore Visitor Pass"" at Orchard Rd MRT for use on rail & Buses, it makes travel around Singapore so easy. $52 for 2 adults unlimited travel & a refund of $20 on return of the pass.We found the Zoo expensive for tourist charge being $37 each. It is huge and found the lay out very confusing going around in circles at times from one animal look out to another. Wear good walking shoes and take water with you. We only found one eating area which served mainly hot food and there was another there that made smoothies. Much better on a hot day."
"As me and my wife joked, we do visit the zoo/aquarium in every city. But, the Singapore Zoo was a notch above. Firstly, almost every area has the option to view animals/birds in the open. Secondly, as with all Singapore wildlife reserves, the experience was also educational and the common theme this time around was conservation of environment.As we had already gone for Night Safari on our prev trip, we opted for the daytime option this time alongwith Rainforest Lumina (a superb experience) and it was worth it!PS:- Although no Metro-station is close by, taxis are easily available and quite reasonable and recommended for families."
"The zoo is very well run. Animals look well taken care of. There are some mosquitoes lurking around which resulted in a few nasty bites, so be reminded to put on repellent.One feedback is that there are very limited vegetarian/vegan options which I was hoping to see more food choices.The zoo should be one of the places that encourages a rich plant based diet."
Singapore zoo is a good place to visit with children. There are many different kind of animals.It takes almost half day to full day to see everything.
"Pre-booked this trip before arriving, sounded great with the wildlife but wasn't exactly sure how this was going to work out. Picked up on time, out guide was called Siwa, and he was really nice and gave a lot of information on the way to the zoo. Arrived at the zoo in good time, so we were seated for our buffet breakfast in the dining area which was just a nice size. The orangutans were brought out to a feeding platform next to dining area. You were able to take pictures freely, and also queue for a closer look to have picture taken...with option to buy. You were then free to explore the park on foot, the tram, or both. We opted to explore ourselves, you can then decide where and what to see yourself.Overall: Nice day, breakfast was decent with plenty choice, and transfers n guide were spot on."
"Really good trip and exhibits are displayed very well, the whole place is very clean and tidy.The best part is the huge aquarium.Tip for people STOP LOOKING AT YOUR PHONE and look up.."
"I found the Singapore zoo better than average (better than Taronga in Sydney but not as good as Australia Zoo). You can go on a river experience for an extra cost - we found it a little lacking, although the amazon experience was good (cost an extra $5). The whole place is great for kids."
Singapore Zoo is always one of the best place to be in. It hosted many animals and is very educating to the young kids. The tropical climate makes it very suitable for most of the animals to live here.
"After walking for 2 hours. We rented 2 scooters for $50S for 4 hours.We rolled from exhibit to exhibit. White tiger and white hippos were amazing. We saw lots of monkeys, leopard, giraffe, zebra all in large natural habitat. Really really large place. Could have spent 2 days if we stopped at every animal exhibit. It is not covered but a few places to duck in when it rains."
"We visited Singapore Zoo on a Sunday morning - worked out just as convenient to catch a taxi there ($20SGD from Little India) rather than take multiple trains over the course of an hour.Zoo well organised, nearly entirely English signs. Normal zoo confusion of paths and enclosures. We managed to walk around everything - although you can take the easy option and train around - in around 2 hours.They have some very useful pull-carts that you can put little kids in, toilets are well spaced and well maintained, and there are plenty of seat and shade options for when you take a break.Trying to leave was problematic - it took us around 20 minutes in the taxi queue - although we could have skipped this and caught the shuttle bus for $1SGD to the nearest MRT station - as a taxi arrived around once every 1 - 2 minutes. Some were cash only, some didn't want to take passengers to where they wanted to go, some got hijacked by people from the drop-off area before they could get to the taxi stand. If you can, download the 'Grab' app and just order a taxi for when you want to leave if you aren't using public transport."
"We started our day at the breakfast with the orangutans, we weren't overly impressed with the breakfast. It was approx $100 Singapore monies. We have forgone our breakfast at the Novotel and wish that we hadn't.You only have a short photo opportunity with the beautiful Orangutans, NO touching and then you are moved on. Photos also cost $35 but they will also use your camera.It was extremely HOT the day we went, so a lot of animals were not visible.We were thinking maybe the night safari would be best.Overall this Zoo is absolutely beautiful, it's lovely to see the animals so free, the grounds are so lovely.The tigers were definitely a massive highlight and they were the most active.You can also hop on the tram and it willDrive around the park if your legs are tired, you can hop on and off whenever you feel.I would definitely love to visit again, maybe in the evening."
"Plenty of animals to see at the Singapore Zoo. Don't miss the free range orangutan, playful otters, primate kingdom and fragile forest. The dining options are on the pricier side. I went in the afternoon and then just stayed on site until it was time for the Night Safari."
"Despite a short 1.5 hour visit just before it's closure. The young kids aged 5,8, and 10 enjoyed themselves."
"We visited the zoo with some friends and their 7 year old son. We booked the wildlife breakfast in advance and really enjoyed seeing the orang-utans but some of the animals seemed distressed in their enclosures, particularly the leopard which was constantly pacing."
"I found the zoo to be very well looked after, all the animals seemed extremely well cared for and happy. I just didn't like how the train didn't stop at the animal exhibits, they would drive right past and you'd have to walk all the way back, it defeats the purpose of saving your legs in the hot and humid conditions.I asked could we be picked but between stations and was told NO, only at the stations, it was so hard as I was exhausted from walking 7 hours the day before.I tried my hardest to find the sloth, but he must have been hiding, it was a shame as it was the main animal I went to the zoo to see.I found it frustrating when asking numerous zoo staff members about the different animals only to get a shake of the head and be told they have no idea."
Not a fan of Zoos (animals should be free) but if you must visit then this zoo does offer excellent views of animals in a somewhat natural environment. Friendly and helpful staff with surprisingly good food choices.
"The zoo occupies 28 hectares in a rainforest environment and is still expanding. It's a well laid out walkable zoo with animals in their natural habitat. Unlike a lot of zoos, the animals are in open spacious enclosures separated from visitors by dry and wet moats. A lot of walking is involved therefore would recommend purchasing the tram tickets, especially if you have children."
"As a Singaporean, and a parent of an ebullient 2 year old, the zoo has been one of our go-to places to keep my daughter entertained and yet educated. For her, there are a variety of shows, feeding of animals, playgrounds and a water park, and many animals arranged to entertain and keep her happy.And this is one of the best zoos in the world - it's walkable, it's informative and it's presented in a way that's just the right amount of information."
"Ranks up there as one of the better zoos we have been to. Well layed out, lots of animals in their natural habitat, some harder to spot than others.Plenty of food and drink options availableAllow half a day as it is a big zoo and lots of walking involved, unless you ride the tram. If you've never been before I would recommend visiting."
We had a great half day at the zoo. The zoo is well organized into zones and you can go along to the zones on the tram. The animals looks well kept. We viewed the elephant show and that was nice.We wanted to have a look at the kangaroo. Unfortunately we could not spot one.WE had a great time at this place.This place is well connected with MRTS. WE would need to take a bus from Kathib MRTS station every 10 minutes.
Booked via a tour that organised breakfast with the orangutans. Nice option if you can do it to get up close to the animals. Did a morning trip and it wasn't too busy on a Saturday. As we were with a tour we had to leave at 1145am so we didn't have time for the shows/presentations. I liked the open plan enclosures but some were still pretty small. You can walk it all but there is a tram that you can pay extra for. Some animals were elusive and only come out to play at night. Loved the fragile forest with the lemurs and flying foxes. Plenty of toilets and seating areas.
"Some native animals kept in fairly natural surroundings. The animals looked healthy and well cared for. Several different trails around, some of which were hilly. Many eating places on site."
"Singapore Zoo is a world class zoo in terms of the variety of birds, animals, and live shows. Many of the birds and animals were seen for the first time face to face since they are not found in India. Highlights are the Panda couple (Kai Kai and Jia Jia) and the live shows.Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari, and Jurong Bird Park are adjacent to each other and must be done on the same day. I visited Singapore Zoo, River Safari, and Night Safari in one day. These places can be visited on the day you arrive in Singapore but not the departing day as Night Safari gets over quite late in the evening."
"I am not a hug fan of zoos. Even so, this was an enjoyable day out. The few shows that we attended were entertaining and a good opportunity to sit for a bit. Paths are all sealed so safe and clean walking. The tram is a good way to get around for those with mobility problems or just plain tired.It was a hot day but there is plenty of shade. Lots of toilets, water refill stations and places to sit. Food onsite was much better than expected. An enjoyable day out."
"It is a very good zoo, but having also visited the San Diego zoo and even Chester Zoo in the UK we were a little disappointed by the lack of information about the specific animals they had. Other zoos give you a family history of the animals and their names so you can feel involved. Having said that the interactive feeding sessions were excellent and very informative. Overall a good day out, follow it up with the Night Safari which is also very good."
"I visit the Spore Zoo almost yearly or bi-yearly. It is always well maintained and I love the variety of animals here. The 1st half of the visit was usual n nt as exciting as the displays remained unchanged. However, i was delighted that the Reptile Hse was v interesting with close up views of various lizards n chameleons. The Fragile Forest was sadly under going partial reno, but i still managed to see a few free roaming ring-tailed Lemurs, mouse deers, ducks and parrots. Was v happy to see my favorite Meerkats and the close up glass view where i came face to face with 2 Cheetahs! Most enjoyable part of the River Safari was not the Pandas (where 1 of them was kept due to reno) but the huge tank of Manatees. V relaxing to see them swimming gracefully at the end of the day. The Spore Zoo is definitely a great plc to spend the entire day out, esp if u love animals like me!"
"best value for money if a tourist to SG and you buy the combined entrance to the zoo, night safari and bird park at Jurong."
Very well planned and maintained Zoological park. once after entrance please collect the map which shows a roundabout of all the major stops in attractions around. In total the four stages. One has to start from stage 1 AND end at stage 4. All the four stages have have got major attractions around it. There is a local train sharing tourists from each stage to stage. One can take a tram if required and see all major attractions in every stage. Near stage 1 wonderful foot court is present which caters to all countries and communities. Will be little confusing for a while and study of the map will clear all doubts in mind.
"Had a great experience! The buffet food was good and plentiful and the experience was well organised, ensuring the sfety of both the animals and humans. Our table was very close to where the animals were sitting and we were able to get our photos taken with them. The actual photos were expensive - $35 singapore dollars. However, they also had someone who used your own camera to take photos so you did not have to buy the official ones if you didn't want too."
Lot of animals at the zoo. The place is clean and I enjoyed a lot. Good place for children to visit. Animals are also very friendly and used to humans
"Nature and conservation is one thing I am passionate about so the work done at Singapore zoo really touches my heart. I went in the night safari with my group from Ghana, we also went to watch the animal shows. If you visit Singapore, the zoo should be on your itinerary"
Amazing landscape and animals. However do not go for the night safari as it is only interesting for kids. You simply do not see many animals and it is a rip off.
"zoo is greattried the night ride and is quite good, also the kids enjoyed it better due to the weather.too long lines to get in the night-animals show, and is just ""ok"", people there must find they way to make it faster/comfortable considering people is waiting there with small kids.then after it, other long line to get into the night ride...we also tried the boat ride... not good at all!.. scenery is great but just it, kids did not have any fun there!"
"A must see on your list when you come to Singapore, not only for the amazingly different and extraordinary creatures that are on display; the separate sections of reptopia etc are well organised! Take a 4-in-1 park hopper pasd n see jbp, zoo, luminia n nigjt safari in one go"
"One of the best zoos that I have ever visited. Nice place for all age groups. If you have plan to visit all the 4 parks (Singapore Zoo, River Safari, Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park), you can probably buy a park hopper ticket, which makes sense.Singapore Zoo is big enough a place and you can spend at least half a day there (many visitors spend a whole day). While the tram option looks good, keep in mind that if you want to explore the whole of zoo, you will have to walk a lot even if you get down at just the tram stations (4 in all). I would suggest better walk down instead of taking tram. Yes, it takes time and is a bit tiring. But you can plan to retire for the day after this.Kids would love the animal shows. Orangutans are a major draw. You can also have breakfast with them by paying some charges. Please check for timings of the shows before visiting. There's also a wet play area for kids which they would love."
"The zoo is well organized and lots construction is in progress on site.The only bad thing is that rats are running around in the Fragile Forest and even after writing in to the Zoo, it had not improved.Rats are now running near the platform as well."
"We had an overall enjoyable experience, but for the price I thought it was good value, bit very good value. This is swayed by the fact we were advised to focus on doing the zoo first given it shut at 6pm (we arrived around 2:30pm) and the river safari shuts at 7. We had a good look through the zoo to start and other than the polar bears being off display due to renovations (a shame for us but understandable in any good animal attraction) it was nice. We the. Headed over to the River Safari side at about 5:30pm. The staff member at the entrance said 'you do the boat ride first' and pointed us to the left of the entrance. We followed the path that seemed to go on and on with various displays along the way. We were enjoying looking around but I was wondering where this 'boat ride' was as it certainly wasn't first. We then arrived at the Panda exhibit which was slightly confusing as it had a 'currently off display' type sign near the entrance - I was disappointed as it's rare you see Pandas so I continued up the path only to find it was indeed open and the Panda was in clear view which was great. We then continued in the journey to the next stop - the River Cruise, only to find it closed at 6pm (it was now 6:03pm). I explained our 3 year old was very excited to see it but was told no sorry it closes at 6pm. We were quite dejected at this as the ride was the only way to see the Jaguar - another rarely seen zoo animal. We then continued on our journey to find the squirrel monkey Forrest walk also closes at 6pm. If we had been told the timings of these closures or there had been announcements we absolutely would have rushed through as they are the key highlights (it's called River Safari after all). I mentioned in my way out that this was disappointing but was simply told 'yes they close at 6pm'...shame as otherwise we had a very satisfactory visit and these sorts of disappointments could so easily have been avoided."
Me and my husband went to the zoo. I give 3 stars because the ambience is nice.. you see more plantantion and green around than actual animals. Not worthy of the money.
"I went there with my kid, however as it was raining so we could not walk around the entire zoo. Would suggest to build more sheltered area, if possibleWould advise to bring some food if the booked timing is between 8am to 10am, as none of the eateries were open until 10/11am. We were really hungry, however there is only 1 place inside the Singapore zoo where the food stalls were, so we had to wait."
It's been years since our last visit- this time with a little child. Booking must be made online because of entry timing - due to new measures because of COVID-19. To ensure safety of visitors n minimise crowding. The weather was hot even on a cloudy day. The exhibits of animals looks more leisurely - again because of the pandemic. Some places you still need to queue. No more polar bear n the famous Ah Meng. Still a good place to spend the day with other places like River Safari or Night Safari after that. Be early for the shows - again limited n lesser seating due to safety measures. Quite a disappointment to miss them.
"This zoo was opened in year 1973 and not much changes over the years. animals are few and seems not happy, maybe they are shut from covid for some months already. There are no shows screened and singapore weather hot and humid."
It is fun and enjoyable. You can see a lot of interesting things and you may find some animals running around. But prepare umbrella as it can very very hot
"Not really so impressive zoo, animals are very common to me , so I can say just an average zoo place to hang on with your friends, hope they add more intersting animals."
"I had read reviews of Singapore Zoo as a must see and that it was one of the top three zoos in the world.Unfortunately I have to disagree. Although there are a large number of species at the zoo some of the cages/ enclosures are very small and I do not believe they are suited to keeping animals in captivity. The enclosures for the Lions, Tigers, Penguins and Rhinos were far too small and the creatures themselves looked very sad and depressed.I have been to a number of zoos around the world and this would not even feature in my top 10.Also the zoo is no where the main part of the city. I thought the trip involved a journey on the metro and that would be it. However this is not the case and it takes approx an hour to reach the zoo from the CBD. 30 minutes on the metro and then a further 30 minutes on the bus.Overall a disappointing trip and there are better things to do in Singapore if you have a limited time."
Started our tour and was hard to see any animals. Got to the elephant area and none to be seen unless we wanted to wait around for the show?? It is a ell set out place but when you do not get to see many animals you have to wonder. Maybe when all the work is finished it may improve.
"I did the night safari and it was really unimpressive, fast and just mehAt the end of the Safari there's a little show that was very nice though, very lively and animals do cools tricksGreÃ¢t for kids"
"The last time I visit the Singapore Zoo was a decade ago. The Splash Safari Show was good. Other than that, nothing really special. There are trams roaming around the zoo and a water park located at the north side of the zoo. The tickets are expensive but kids will definitely love it. Spent half a day to finish everything."
There are many developments under construction here. Many enclosures closed for upgrading.Animals all appear to be cared for sheltered from heat.
All these years I had heard highly of the Singaporean zoo so when I planned a trip to Singapore this was one place I was really excited to go with my little daughter. I must admit that it's quite systematic and organised and it scores high on the overall presentation but I failed to see a lot many animals and a few of them looked poorly nourished. Though this could be a subjective statement but I have seen zoos with better well kept animals. On all the other aspects the zoo scores full marks. The shows were not very interesting and the one I really liked was the splash safari. Rest are just okay. You need to walk a lot in the zoo premises so I suggest that you buy the ticket inclusive of trams. Keep yourself well hydrated as you stroll around the zoo since it's quite hot most of the days. You have plenty of water stations to fill your water bottles. Take a zoo map along with you so you can organise yourself better off and be able to watch all the shows. Food in the zoo premises is decent and a meal for two could be wrapped between 20-25 SGD. For those who have the opportunity to have seen better zoos elsewhere can consider skipping this one if you are short of time.
Not very impressed with our visit. It was quite warm and lots of impatient people (locals).The enclosures were deserted as the animals were seeking shade.Apparently this zoo is placed in the top 10? God knows how.
"The only zoo in singapore. I bought ticket online to avoid entrance long queuing. So few animals there, subsituted by elastic robotic animals and dioramas."
The place just need snakes and after its be amazing.. But its good place and save to visit with kids.
"We have been members for past 7-8 years. we visited today with some friends who had visited us. The shows today were reflective of a very bored staff and no creativity in the animal shows. In the past, the best show was ""Saving the rainforest or rainforest fights back"" but today's show was by far the worst that I have seen in the Zoo so far. Very disappointing. hope there is improvements in the coming time."
Been to other zoo's and this is not particularly large although there is a tram that you can use to get around. Usual shows etc available and where possible there are views of the animal without fencing
"We had been looking forward to this Night Safari trip as it had been recommended by all our friends who have visited Singapore. To be honest apart from the meal which was of a very high quality especially for a buffet we found the trip a little underwhelming. Maybe we are too worldly wise and have seen many good zoos but this was a poor experience. We were taken of a little train through the park but a lot of the animals couldn't be seen which is why they had keepers in certain ares to wake up and handle the animals so we could see them. The commentary was fine and interesting it just that we couldn't always see the animals and you couldn't take photographs with flash, When the tour was over we were recommended a couple of trails to wander around or go and see the animal show. We opted for the latter as we hadn't much time and it was so dark neither of us fancied attempting the trails in the dark on our own.The show was OK but nothing to write home about. The female presenter did her best to make it more exciting than it was.A disappointing night out from a keen zoo visitor but the meal was delicious."
"This was hands down the single biggest thing my husband and I were looking forward to in Singapore. However I'm really not sure it's worth the stress or the money.The excursion itself is quite rushed, the moment you get to the zoo you sit down to have a very poor buffet breakfast, then no sooner than taking my first bite the staff were rushing everyone to queue to take photos with the orangutans. Once it was our turn to have our photo taken it was very rushed and the experience just felt like cattle being herded.Personally I would say there are far better day trips to enjoy in Singapore."
"The park was nice, but a bit confusing. We had to double back a few times to see some animals that are in a corner somewhere. Needs a more clear trail to lead you by all the animals. They make a lot of effort in making the park look neat and natural. It's not nice to see that most of the animals are in very small enclosures. Although I'm sure they are very concerned about the animal welfare, a lot of improvement can be made in that department. It feels like the commercial aspect is more important.The zoo is located in a quite remote area, so if you didn't pack any food, your only option is to eat the bad food offered in and around the park.Also did the night safari on the same day, I would recommend the night safari over the zoo, as they have a lot of the same animals and the night safari is a totally different experience than an average zoo. The same concerns over the animal welfare do apply to the night zoo."
Good place to see all the animals in a open forest themed Zoo.You can experience their living in their natural habitat..Really I missed that Polar Bear which was great a attraction to me when I visited there four years back
"Actually a wonderful zoo. I suggest a visit. I will just try and save people from one dreaded mistake that this zoo should fix immediately. They have a bus that runs every 20 minutes to a nearby train station, and unlike every other bus you rode in your life, you CANNOT buy the one dollar ticket on the bus, you must make the 8 minute round trip walk back to the ticket stand where you will likely be walking back up to the bus just in time to watch it pull out making you wait another 20 minutes for the next bus. I'm not going to lie, I almost want to give 1 star for this... But the zoo itself is nice."
"A lovely zoo, (I first visited 30 years ago) it was Good, but not as grat as our own Australia Zoo in QLD, both designed by Steve Irwin."
"I had my first sighting of a Madagasgan Red Ruffed Lemur at the Singapore Zoo. Unfortunately, there were too few animals for the expansive area, certainly compared to Melbourne's Zoo. We heard it is to be re-sited close to the Aquarium in the near future which might explain it."
"It's a zoo. They have animals in a cage...Otherwise not so easy to reach with public transport. $36 for an adult ticket. About $120 for a family of 4.The friends of the park season pass is good if you life here, let's you go to all 4 parks.Very busy on weekends and holidays. Also look to see when the locals have school vacation as it adds to the crowds."
"The only reason I give this place a 3/5 is because the night safari near by (in my opinion) a lot more fun, especially in groups of people and for children. The animals here are better, and the orangutans are fun to watch, but the whole experience isn't something I'd die to relive."
Expected a lot more from the zoo. An average experience of the visit to the Singapore zoo. One interesting things was watching the feeding of various animals including the tigers.
"While I admire the zoo layout and environment which are very well created to mimic the amazon or rainforest, unfortunately, the wildlife is not many as I expected and the tight jungle makes it hard to spot the animal (if it's for animal sake, I would love to understand and withdraw my complaint)The whole Australian animal is not available for some reason.Luckily the show is amazing and educational for marine environment awareness from my expereince with lion seal show."
"When we first visited 14 years ago we drove ourselves to exhaustion and were not done when we finally left. This trip the zoo was a nice zoo, but not nearly as impressive as it was 14 years ago. It was not worth the US$100 admission for the two of us."
"Although the zoo is renowned, and the layout is nice with most animals kept in areas that try to replicate their natural environment, we were actually disappointed not to see more animals.Admittedly our visit was rather short (an organised half day tour) and maybe we would have seen more if we'd spent a whole day there."
"Really only for people who haven't been to any good Zoo's in the past. A good Zoo, but not a necessity to see."
"Was highly recommended by friends for our kids and our kids loved it so it was worth it. However there are plenty of 'meh' reviews.Let me tell you what does the experience involves and hopefully u can make your own mind up.Prepurchase tickets in advance online- two parts: entry to zoo and 'breakfast'- our children didn't have to pay for breakfast, no breakfast ticket was issued though which was a little disconcertingArrived at zoo at opening - 830.Taxi from orchard around $20-255-10min walk to Ah Meng restaurant. Highly recommend renting stroller ($15/d) if your kids don't walk well.Lined up for breakfast and then guided to table. Slightly disconcerting that some people were able to prebook 'prime' tables but it doesn't matter in the end.Breakfast is pretty average - think 3 star hotel buffet. Plenty of water, juice and fruit though. Some hot food - bacon, eggs, kaya bao, siew mai, toast.Orangutans come out at 930 and sit on a platform. You can't touch them. Line up to take a picture in front of them ... plenty of time, NO RUSH. Everyone gets a turn.A couple other animals came out - two eagles, a snake and a cockatoo. U can touch the snake (if u want).That's it. If u love animals or have young kids - you'll probably love the experience."
"Singapore Zoo and the neighbouring River Safari are must visits when going to Singapore for longer than a stopover. The multi-park tickets are good value even if you don't go to all 4 (the other 2 being the Night Safari and Jurong Bird Park).Having said that, your experience cannot be guaranteed. A lot depends on the weather, time of day and luck.The weather was hot and humid for our visit so rain wasn't a problem. But overall our visit was disappointing. Animal enclosures were being renovated and in the open exhibits, many of the animals were invisible or immobile. I took 18 photos at both parks, compared to 87 at Gardens of the Bay. There was a decent variety of animal species and the parks are well laid out and attractive. I don't regret going but there was a wow factor missing. The Zoo has a big reputation and while good, isn't great. We didn't go to the Night Safari so cannot judge whether that would be a better option or whether you need to do it as well to appreciate the overall experience. We completed both parks in half a day."
"Got food poisoning from the outdoor restaurant at the zoo. Food was kept lukewarm instead of hot, tasted odd and within a few hours, I had stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea. Paid big $ to get in and expensive lunch to be left very ill for 2 days. Would not go back to the zoo."
"have been to the Singapore Zoo many times and also love the River Safari, but this time I found so many areas and exhibits under renovation/construction and the panda died and was not replaced, I feel this is a big attraction as you can see him swimming from either the River Safari or the Zoo.took the 8 and 11 year olds with us and they enjoyed the River Safari much more, Singapore Zoo sorry but you need to reinvent yourself to keep up with what else is on offer now!"
"Average Zoo, Not bad, but nothing amazing. We attended the breakfast with orangutans, but we wouldn't recommend it. It was a tourist trap with average food and a huge group of people lining up to get an expensive picture with the orangutans in the background."
"A long way to walk in the heat, but worth it. The tram system is not policed well, and once on it most people don't get off.Travelled with my elderly parents and young kids who struggled to walk the distance in the heat, but couldn't use the tram even though we paid for it.Food places are few and far between, grossly overcrowded with very little seating and massive queues, and waiting times.Toilets are well maintained.There is very little in the way of shade and seating st the kids water play area too.A few more shaded stops, with seating would be appreciated.A better purposed and organised taxi rank would be good too. Waiting for a half hour in the heat after walking all day is quite ridiculous"
"I used to be a Friend of the (Singapore) Zoo when my children were young. We had enjoyed visiting the zoo almost every weekend to see the animals and watch the animal shows. I remembered we would encounter animals at almost every turn of corners and my children had learnt a lot about the animals from the commentaries just by pressing a button at every exhibit. But that was many many years ago. I haven't gone to the Singapore Zoo for more than 15 years since my children had grown up. Last week i took my grandchildren (ages 2 and 1) to this zoo and i found it very different from years ago. First we were given a rather badly designed map of the zoo at the entrance. The map gave confusing directions to the various animal exhibits. The animal enclosures are far apart and the animal shows were not as captivating as before. The trees are so overgrown the whole place looks like an abandoned jungle. There was also no more recorded commentaries at the exhibits. Overall, quite a let-down especially considering that the much higher entrance fees compared to years ago."
"Singapore Zoo is in a great jungle setting with free roaming monkeys, lizards etc. The orang enclosure with them freely climbing through the forest is great as are the reptiles and fruit bats. However, felt that many animals are in enclosures that don't meet modern standards - African animals in particular.This detracted from an otherwise excellent day out"
But if you have been to real jungle safari's this might not at all excite you. Good for kids and elders. Not so adventurous.
It's super hit thing must visit if you have 5days. Otherwise skip it and go for garden by the bay. Not really into night safari.
"it was very hot day, even in the shade. Park was ok, but as I have been to many other places like this, I liked much better Loro park in Tenerife Canary islands and Xcaret in Mexico.Location is not so good, quite far from city center, we took a taxi to the park and used public shuttle bus on the way back, which is not departing often, I think 30mins or more. There are many places to eat inside, but i advise not to leave it to the last hour of closing the park, we came around 40mins to closure and much of the food was gone/closed, only a few choices in the restaurant left."
"We visited on an overcast day, although it was still very hot and humid so I would definitely recommend using the tram service as it's a long walk all the way around.The zoo has 'open' enclosures so the animals have more space and they have clearly taken care to give the animals a variety of enrichment ideas in their enclosures. We spoke with one of the keepers while walking around and he told us that the animals are all away at night (from 5.45) particularly the dangerous ones because all it would take was a tree to fall in the night and they could escape. Apparently one of their ring tailed lemurs has taken to leaving the area he is supposed to be in and likes to go for a wander but he always comes back of his own accord :)There is an amazing array of animals including orangutangs, white tigers, elephants doany more. I'm told the zoo works alongside other zoos such as London zoo in their conservation and breeding programmes.The zoo is split into four areas; the main zoo, night Safari, river safari and bird zoo.While we enjoyed the main zoo and all it had to offer including the kidzone, which has a giant water climbing frame and all the wonderful animals. Sadly we didn't enjoy the river safari so much, I guess if you like fish it's the place for you. In truth those only went to the river safari because that's where they have the giant pandas, the giant otters and manatees where a happy coincidence we were only in the river safari for 45mind. The night safari was amazing great to see the animals at this time of day, although definitely worth getting the first time slot of the evening as we had to question for around 30mins to get onto the tram. Each section is charged separately so well worth buying the multiple park tickets."
Hot & humid weather and the crowd made it tiring. Tram rides gave some relief. Children liked it but not cost effective.
"Bring your walking shoes! This zoo is extensive and pricey. There are multiple areas (safaris) that require seperate tickets. The grounds are lush and expansive, however the animals on display are limited. Good primate displays in the main zoo and the river walk safari. Easy transport using the MRT"
"I visited Singapore Zoo many times quite a few years back. But during this year visit to send my relative there, I am quite disappointed. We found many attractions are closed, and animal shows are lower standard compared to old times. Show Venue are also don't improve with enough ventilation. When other attractions in Singapore are upgraded and new, I think Singapore Zoo really need to do the catch up game to gather more local & tourists."
Bought the 4 in 1 zoo pass to visit all parks. We were really excited about this trip to the zoo. If I'm honest I'm not sure how I feel. It's supposed to be the best place for the animals etc while they are protecting them but some of the areas look so run down and dirty. Yes not all animals like cleanliness but I've Seen other zoos.It gets so busy you never get to ride the tram. Even though it was in my ticket.We walked around for hours but I just wasn't overly wowed!Some cool animals from around the world. I guess I am a bit sceptical when I see animals in zoo's.Sorry
"Cozy, small... too small... and too little of fantasy.You can make more cozy places for sitting, sightseeing. More bridges, more funny constructions and more animals.It's too bad for such a nice city like Singapore.Hire me and I will make a pearl from this spot."
"I just visited Singapore Zoo (not the other parks) and whilst I had a very good day and saw so many animals, most areas and the exhibits and looking very tired and worn out.The online booking process is so easy, so you can avoid queueing on entry and it gives you a discount, and the Shuttle Bus from the MRT really is so simple to use it's easy to get there even if it is far from the city."
"I was recommend to visit Zoo while I traveling to Singapore. I figured out this is one of must to dos because other things you can dos only shopping. We don't like the whole animals performing for treats aspect of it. Overall, we really enjoyed everything in Singapore as the city very clean and foods very good too."
"I think it is best check the programme to maximise feeding times lions, seal shows etcThis way you see best action . I think the Night zoo is the most fun and a totally different experience ."
My advice would be to skip it if you have already been to Safari World Bangkok. There is nothing exceptional about it. Good experience for kids.Kids enjoyed the water park.
It's a zoo. They have animals in a cage...Otherwise no so easy to reach with public transport. $36 for an adult ticket. About $120 for a family of 4
The Zoo is undergoing a major renovation to keep up with changing times.It continues to be an attraction that lures tourist and locals.Plenty of interesting exhibits where growing children can observe and learn.Animal shows and scheduled feeding of animals are a major draw.One can spend a full day to enjoy.There is also an opportunity to add some more exhibits that represents ASEAN countries such as Sumatrian tigers.
"The zoo has had great reviews so I was expecting something amazing .. it wasn't .. Maybe for standards across Asia it may stand head and shoulders above other zoos / not sure as first time I have visited a zoo in this continent . It was easy to get around but felt there was something lacking.. at the end of the visit the only thin I felt and knew was that I would not go back to a zoo again .. I have no time animals are being well looked after , but I left with a feeling that some were in pens too small - the wolves were pacing back and forth in small space , the lions area seemed far too small and as for the few elderly elephants out in parade in the arena .. (which itself offered little shade for the people watching the 'show') it felt contrived and uncomfortable to watch. Though zoo is well kept of course the animals all seemed to be kept in areas too small . There was a homage to the polar bear (that had lived there )who died last year ... glad I never saw him as to think about an animal like that being kept in a city averaging 29 degrees daily , is truly horrifying( no doubt he had been well looked after ) but for me just emphasised that some of these magnificent creatures should not be kept in such false surroundings .. sorry not for me .."
"The white tigers are so beautiful!!!Some Animals that i really wanted to see were missing though, they closed off the giraffes, leopard etc., one of the staff said they were preparing them for the night safari. Which is unfair because it was only around 4.It gets super hot to walk around, like you'llBe soaking with sweat, so best to bring thoseLittle fans and water.Amazing zoo, just disappointed I wasn't able to see some of the animals."
"While the entire zoo was very comfortable for the human visitors, can't help but feel that it's gotten a little too much for the animals. Many of which could be seen turning their backs to the gawkers. Also there didn't seem like a lot of shade available in some enclosures (rhinos) and lack of stimulation (elephants).The one aspect which I did love was the cageless spaces for some animals which was a delight to see them walk around and exploring."
"It's no fault of the zoo's. It's just not possible to enjoy yourself outside for more than a couple of hours in this climate.Also, I encourage you to take your lunch as soon as the cafeteria opens at 11am or whenever it is because if you wait for a proper lunch time you will be packed like a sardine in a half hour queue holding your tray, face to sweat armpit of every tom dick and harry's duck dog and you'll have a panic attack. Same thing will happen if you go to see the elephant feeding. If you go, go 20 min early so you can actually see the elephants while you're huffing those armpits, unable to move and trying to catch your breath."
"Probably a educational way for kids to learn about animals, especially kids that are raised in a city but I grew up on a farm so wasn't a big deal for me. Also even though Zoo can help promote animal welfare I'm not a fan of having animals held in captivity."
All thr 4 zoo are very beautiful and wortha visit. There are lot of shows done for kids to see and worth a visit.They learn about wildlife and also about not using plastics.
Pretty disappointing. We were unlucky that the heavens opened up and poured rain that day. All the animals were sheltering. The breakfast itself was disappointing. The bus picking us up from different hotels took too long to get there and it was almost over when we arrived. The two OrangUtans that had been eating were obviously full and kept giving there handlers the look that said ' can we go yet?'
"I love going to the Zoo and wanted to see if the Singapore Zoo lived up to the hype...I was told it was better than San Diego, CA. NO WAY! If you're a Zoo lover, San Diego Zoo is a must see."
It's very hot and humid and for the few animals that they have it may be not worth the price of $37 per adult. There are some shows which are interesting but not really amazing.
Breakfast with the Orangutans was disappointing. It was very touristy and there were too many people around to be able to admire and observe these beautiful animals.
Everything is good. Have been going every now and then with the kids. Only that the shows aren't really attractive like last time. Hope they look into this.
Wish there would be more sheltered resting points.The price of food and water is super terribly expensive which is ridiculous.
"Nice day out however much smaller than expected and not many animals to be seen! No sign of white tigers, polar bear or elephants ... however a bonus being the kids got to hand feed a giraffe !"
We have not been to the zoo for awhile so decided to revisit. Highlights were the animal shows which are always a delight to watch.The only disappointing thing is the lack of available cold mineral water for drinking. They used to have drink vending machines all over the park but not anymore! There isn't any choice for purchase except for one type of alkaline water which is undesirable to us. KFC outlet located inside the zoo premises also ran out of chicken!
"Good attractions, some were closed though.Took my Mom on wheelchair; probably won't do it again. The paths are not wheelchair friendly."
"The Zoo was fun, my kids enjoyed their time seeing the animals, however we would get bored of it quite quickly and the ticket was so expensive."
We booked breakfast with the orangutans before leaving home so we were looking forward to seeing the orangutans. The bus arrived 15 minutes before the orangutans were brought out. No time to have breakfast and see the orangutans.The zoo was disappointing as many aminals were single creatures and some looked very sad.I was looking forward to our visit as it is supposed to be one of the best in the world but would not rush backN
Was expecting too much I think. We have been to lots of zoos and was a bit disappointed with this one by international standards. There were highlights but overall it was not a patch on the River Safari which was far better value and more to see.
Unfortunately myself my wife my daughter came here on a tour for breakfast with the animals unfortunately it was rushed it was raining and just a little bit miserable with crowds of people pouring in it was beyond ridiculous but it was still an okay time
This Zoo was rated as one of the best in the world! Was quite disappointed as the tiger enclosure was shut and there didn't seem to be as many animals as I was expecting. We have been to Auckland and Wellington Zoo in NZ and Taronga Zoo in Sydney and I would highly recommend any of those ones! It took us a maximum of 2 hours to get round everything and in that time we also watched the feeding of the elephants!
We went there and everything was just amazing but the staff and the management is always more interested in taking pictures of people rather than noticing what better they can do to make it a better experience for people especially for babies. As Singapore is always hot and humid we went with our babies and booked the buggies and the staff failed to explain that this buggy will only take you to the stops not to the cages since it was the first time we went their it was staff's responsibility to explain us everything so we buy tickets if they suit us. So we were dropped at stops and we had to walk to the cages which were quite far from each other and because of sun my babies cried the whole time that we left in the middle of our tour and went back to our hotel Shangri-La... the buggy was also very luggage un friendly because the bigger strollers could hardly fit in and yes you have to fold the stroller each time you ride on the buggy so it was instead a painful deal for us to open and close the stroller after every 5 minutes.. they should put in some air coolers and a shaded pathway for people who are walking our heads and hair were heated like anything and we soon got a severe head ache.
"Not really a fan of the concept of a zoo. That said - this was better than others I've been to. Nice environment for most of the animals. Went on a Saturday, lots of people, especially noticable at the food court. Takes a while to get there if you go by subway and then public transport."
Feel like lesser animals in the zoo. Animals look very tired & old . Didn't manage to see the bear as it has passed on last year . Service at the mart (near the entrance ) was really bad! The Chinese lady doesn't seem to enjoy her work . Showing sour face when being asked for assistance . The tram driver (Yusoff) is one of the best ! He bothered to explain every single detail. He is an assist to the company .
I was expecting more having heard about the open zoo spaces but I was disappointed. I don't like zoos in general and whilst it's a pleasant enough day out I can't really recommend it very much
"Decent zoo in places, though I did have some concerns over the enclosure sizes for some of the animals."
"Second visit and much more memorable first time, lack of animals to see and why does it need a plastic Dinosaur Park!!!"
"This is a popular trip, which probably explains its shortcomings. Hordes of people are put into 'trains' to drive through the enclosures. The idea is great, but it needs to be slowed down just a little bit to appreciate what you are seeing. It is like being on a very fast conveyor belt. The recorded commentary is also really, really bad - two very whiney American accents, with a script that is often really patronising. This could be a great experience but they seriously need more attention to quality over quantity, and to de-americanise - its Singapore! One practical tip: This is in the dark and flashes are not allowed, so if you are looking for a good photographic opportunity you will see less but get better photos in the day."
Breakfast experience was really not that good at Zoo. Overall Zoo is always good.Staff at Zoo was good
"My kid loves the zoo very much. However, the tram in the zoo compound was way too much. We need to extra careful and keep avoid the tram from 1 point to another. And this is our greatest fear when visiting the zoo."
"The Singapore zoo is well-known, reputably the 2nd best zoo in the the world. The premises are huge. We were disappointed to see that much space is allocated to visitors but that most animals (except monkeys) have very little space, and certainly too little space to move around and be happy. There are not so many animals (usually only a couple per species, sometimes one individual only, with not so many species represented). We found that many other zoos in the world are better, especially Beauval in France. A disappointing and pricey experience. We won't come back."
"I was told this was an amazing zoo but I didn't really feel like it was that great. Average at best. Although the lay out is beautiful and there are some nice exhibits, for the price, I didn't think it was worth it."
"I would recommended private buggy tour. You have a great time learning the real fact about this animal and mammal plus get close up with them. The tour guild was very understanding about them too. We have a one on one feel with the snake. We did the rhino feeding too. It was such close up ...... wow ....... we also visit the old male turtle .... wow ... this turtle was amazingly surprised to us. Usually they just lay there and sleep !!! The guild teach us how to stroke the turtle neck and he stand to stand up ??? Wow we love it.Unfortunately we could not see the white tiger and we were sad to see the polar bear past way !!!! When I was young , I love coming to see him so enjoy in his own glass pool. Hope they could bring one back again.These zoo was well kept and the cleanliness was good. The washroom was clean. I find that the souvenir shop prices are expensive for those quality ?!?We saw the sea-lion show. It was great and fun for the kids. The ticket price is very reasonable. We met the buried ground of Ah Meng !! I was surprised when the guild told us ...... so special. Even Michale Jackson's have one on one private time with him. Wow .......... I will definitely return again on my next visit to Singapore."
Nodoubt it has one of the best landscaping but i feel if one has visited bangkok safari world then there's no need to go there. Even shows in the Bangkok zoo were far better than the singapore zoo.
"I went with family during Chinese New Year holiday. My experience was quite an average. I had been to zoo couple of times earlier and must say this has been decline in overall experience. Activities are not much fun especially star attraction of Elephant Show is not quite there anymore. Zoo has also lost some animals recently. Though overall maintenance is good, but it seems to me now very costly affair with value for money. I will certainly think thrice before going there again."
show timing is too short and less interactive with the animals for visitors to experience once a lifetime.
"I had huge expectations after many people told me how good the zoo was, it turned out disappointing. It's ok, animal spaces are quite small and everything is overpriced, from tickets to activities and food inside the zoo."
Brought my family to zoo during cny period and it was very crowded. A lot of animal hiding in shelter due to hot weather. So did not manage to see some of the animal. I remembered it was much more animals back then.
"The zoo was fantastic, my favourite exhibit is always the Fragile Forest, having the animals roaming around at close distance is just a surreal feeling. The only dislike was that the food court was just too crowded and the queues of people were just impossible to combat especially with young children. Indoor seating was rather limited and outdoor seating was just extremely cramp and dirty."
"Singapore Zoo is a great effort to conserve wildlife and offers one roof to witness wildlife from across the globe. However, the tram ride is very disappointing as we get very little chance to sight wildlife and main attractions remains to be covered as walking trail which is tedious given hot humid weather.It would be of gr8 help if measures are adopted to facilitate major attractions in tram ride!!!"
A bit small and not a whole lot to see (compared to our usual London zoo that is...) Like the fact that some monkeys and go outside confinements
The animal experiences aside (as you can't review them) the shows were relatively boring and signs not that information. Not amazing value for money but could be a lot worse.
"The zoo is clean and safe but for me it is still a zoo and animals don't belong their. The zoo is nice and animals are not in cages, temperature are the one they are used to. but still, space is small and I found out that my girl had more fun in to the climbing structure then to see animals. I don't think we will go back. And I still hope that animals will survive where they really belongs..."
"Big place and many animals that you can found inside the zoo, you need to walk, it was very hard for us with small kid even though we rented stroller. I will not recommend it with the small kids, (ideally 4 yrs is the best age to come) You need to ride, but if you ride you need to pay (Unfortunately no free rides) you need to walk to see the animals in their caves. Very tiring and the place was very hot."
You will need to take the underground for about half an hour and then wait for a bus to take you to the zoo. The zoo was ok but I felt that it was too much for older people to walk around. There is transport around the zoo but it's a matter of waiting for the next vehicle.
think this is my 10th time revisting. They are doing the same old shows and nothing has been changed to make it interesting. wont go again
"Everything was okay until we saw this.Barely any wide spaces for these horses to run freely. They looked depressed, imagine what is it like to be living your whole life in a tight environment, where you cant run to your heart's content."
"The zoo used to be great. Every time booked with breakfast with the orangutans. Today only small groups of animals. The missing animals are now apparently distributed to the other parts (River Safari / Night Safari). In the third attempt we wanted to feed the white rhinos this time. But shortly before, the feeding was not carried out. This was our last visit there after the 3rd visit"
"50% of this place felt so miserable with only 1 or 2 animals. They are all looking at the feeding gate. It felt like they are all jailed. The animals are not as lively compare to many others I been to. No doubt the facilities are of certain standard buy the food and drinks they charge init is throat killing. This felt they are so purposely out to earn the money, suggestion you purchase your own sandwiches or drinks outside before entering this place where they are not friendly to guests. Example a plate of chicken rice cost between agd2.5 to max 4.5 at coffeeshop to food court, here they slap you with the price at sgd9.90. so obviously they out to kill. Basically you have no option when you enter this place of hell. Also we all seated to watch the elephant show ..the rain wasn't too heavy and yet they did not inform the cancellation until 10 mins later after the showtime, and by then the rain had stopped. This call service ? Real bad experience. There is no shelter in between if rains which means you will be stuck in one area. Never consider recommending friends to this place."
"We booked a trip through Viagogo that was supposed to be ""breakfast with orang utans"". This was a assive exageration, we were offered a very moderate, warm cooked buffet breakfast then a team of staff brought out 3 orang utans that sat on a plinth while they were fed. We were all kept a a distance then invited up to stand approximately 3 yards in front of the animals and have a photo taken. As a zoo, it was ok but not greatly impressive, the London Zoo is far better."
"Definitely overrated, these 2 zoos in any other location would be classed as one zoo with 1 admission fee. How they can claim the name river safari is beyond me. If you are into different types of fish then this is for you. The main zoo was a big disappointment compared with the Australian zoo we had visited earlier. The food on sale was awful and its the only place were you had to buy water when we bought a coffee."
The zoo itself is a wonderful complex but unfortunatly they have very few animals there unlike most other zoos that I have visited. The one thing that was impressive about it was there care and understanding of the need to take care of the planet and our evironment.
What an overhyped attraction! Not worth a fraction of the entrance fee. Very few animals visible. Tram ride a journey to nowhere. Strongly not recommended. Go in the daytime to actually see something
"The zoo is well organised and has a lovely atmosphere, lots of trees, plants, nice walkways but the animals are few are far between. We had breakfast with the animals .....although it wasn't breakfast with the animals it was buffet breakfast with a hundred other people followed by an invitation to queue up for a picture with an uninterested orangutan taken on an iPhone that I could then purchase if I wanted. Absolutely amazed that this could even be sold as it was."
"Some great exhibits for young & old. A water play area for kids, and some unique animals and exhibits. Sour point of trip was their advertised pricing for over 60yr old has in fine print that foreign seniors pay 2.5x more. Ironically, the zoo is filled with donations from ""foreigners"" - if they did the same for children's pricing it would be equally abhorrent. I will boycott until my parents are treated with the respect they deserve regardless of their flag or language. How about labelling the discount as ""Singaporean Seniors"" so as not to mislead / shame our uncles at the ticket booth?"
I personally didn't like the zoo. I think it's not worth the money that we payed. It is expensive for what they offer.
"Very disappointed with this trip, booked via Viator. The courtesy bus collected us on time from our hotel and took us to collect our tickets, here we were told to wait for the next bus. An hour later it turned up and then sat in traffic for forty minutes. On arrival to the night zoo at 20:00, we were told that all the tours were fully booked until 21:30 and wouldn't be able to see all we had planned to do. We paid extra to get on an earlier train tour at 21:00. This was enjoyable and after we had a little time to wander around but the entire trip was rushed and far from relaxing. Do not book via Viator!"
Visited with Tour East and was very disappointed. The buffet was plentiful but food not hot enough .The safari on the train was ok but not enough time to actually see the animals . Felt very rushed
Was told the Night Safari was the number 1 attraction when visiting SingaporeI find this hard to believe..Nothing you won't see in the daylight and a lot clearer and get some photos..I believe that what this is .... the best marketing strategy that I have seenThousands of people visiting in the dark a place that would normally / should be closed
"Stage performance is not attractive. Lack of theme. Animals r not trained for a more sophisticated performance.Just an intro of body partsApart from all these odds, the upkeeping of the surrounding is great. Signs r clear"
"Its been decades since I last visited. This time I thought my 3 year old son will enjoy it as much as I did when I last came. Truly disappointed. There is only 1 white tiger as compared to 3 whites and 3 brown the last time. 1 cheetah, 1 lion and 1 lioness, 1 warthog lying motionless, 1 sleeping wolverine. Most enclosures have only 1 animal of its type and some, no animals in it. 2 elephants, 2 giraffes, 2 zebras. Its a scorching hot day, so maybe the animals are hidden somewhere.We ended up spending most of the time at the Water Play Park. The park has a few setbacks too. The rubber flooring, on one side of the park, is covered with algae and makes it very slippery. There are some torn rubber mats that can trip you over. A broken slide that has been covered using a green mesh. One broken water sprout. The only fun part, where most kids hang out, is where the big bucket of water pours down onto you."
"I like to share my experience visiting the zoo on 16 th of June 2019. This is the first time we came to Singapore and visited the zoo.I am totally disappointed by the misguidance or you say say non appropriate guidance while buying the ticket. We reached around 11:30am to 12 noon we approach the ticketing counter and ask about the tickets and park details. We was informed that the zoo will cover in 3 hours and river safari in 2 hours. We bought the two tickets in combined, rest no other details was shared regarding the time of the park at the counter nor regarding any extra tram or amazon river tickets to buy additional in park.First we decided to go to zoo area where we found most of the shows are done in morning time just we got one show and rest 3 are around 4-4:30-5 pm around. We went off the zoo in flying as we seen in map of zoo that the river safari was closed at 7 pm so for us we need to finish this very fast but unfortunately we missed all the shows and ran for river safari and we couldn't be back to complete the zoo and we missed all the shows at zoo and half of the park as we were misguided that would cover in 3 hours.Secondly when we went to the river safari we went for the boat which you called cruise, we just see the wait time is there and when we check in at boat it was just a boat ride and no animals to be covered and what they show we already covered in the zoo. Later we found to know that amazon river have charged with wait time so we rush to panda as panda will close at 6. So we rushed but we missed 80 percent of the zoo.So would like to complaint about the misguiding while buying tickets and non guidance of how to cover and when all the activities and even mislead us by telling the zoo will be covered in 3 hours and 2 hours. It was complete waste of our time and money both."
"We visited in April 2019 the Singapore Zoo. The surrounding was nice, the zoo is part of a rain-forrest, but the presentation of the animals could be much better. It was hardly possible to see any animals. The place if the white tigers was e.g. closed. I can' t recommend a visit."
"Compared with my last visit a few years ago, most animals are not there. My impression moves from impressive Zoo to so-so Zoo."
"we hv been here many times, we know the drill. dragon and beast great addon theme but very thin on content. get the zoo staff dressed related theme would be nice.inuka leaving us was sad the current placeholder was a nice gesture.this trip ended on a negative size at taxi area. nuff said."
"I have visited many zoos around the world and reading reviews before deciding to go to Singapore zoo I thought this would be great.Honestly disappointed. I found this place poorly laid out, had limited food options and found it difficult to actually see the animals.The density of the foliage made it a struggle to see anything with many exhibits drawing a blank completely.It was clean but that is about all. We spent 3 hours and felt bored. We followed this with the River Adventurr next door which was so much better. I would never return to the zoo again and wouldn't recommend it to any one."
"Very well structured.. couldn't see enough animals.. we have gotten tickets for all the family. But didn't allow our little one to pass in the river quest as she is below 106 cm. We weren't informed about this.. no refunds, only exchange at the gift shop.. we had tried the river quest, however, no high risk movements were there.. very disappointed with zoo!"
"Tour by Near East Tours. Very large group in a bus that made lots of stops. We were rushed into a lousy, barely edible cafeteria breakfast into a vast room. The orangutans stayed put on a branch in front of the room, a talk by a somewhat knowledgeable guide, inadequate audio. We paraded past the photographer far too rapidly with mild sales pitch to buy the Overpriced souvenir pictures, zero interaction with the orangutans.After the breakfast there was little time to see anything else, lined up for big tour bus and many hotel drop offs. The zoo itself looked great but i didn't get to see it. This left me wanting more and more authentic."
"We visited the zoo safari to see my favourite animal the panda and we did the night safari afterwards. I was expecting the animal enclosures to be really big with the wealth of Singapore however this was not the case and we witnessed the pandas and the jaguar pacing up and down, which is a sign of animal psychosis or mental illness. I will never visit a zoo again as I think it's wrong in this day and age to get pleasure from seeing caged animals who have never experienced any form of freedom. This visit made me realise this."
"We were incredibly upset to see a lot of the exhibits were closed for either renovations or just shut down. This needs to be advertised, Esp as my partner wanted to go to see the white tiger n this was closed for renovations. Most of the animals were not easy to be seen, the monkeys were out n about which we enjoy but overall it wasn't a spectacular outing just a very average zoo visit."
"I couldnt find How to get there on your website and finally realised i landed on the corporate site!!! I had to google how to get there instead.I was with my 20 months daughter, and she was so scared of the GOT dragons. Not sure the relevance of that in zoo.Because its hot and she's alos tired, she sat in her stroller. But most of the time, she can't see because of the bushes !!! U need to consider better visibility for kids in stroller!Weather is too hot. Should have more trees so its not so hot or have mist fans."
"Very disappointed by the zoo. Didn't see many animals other than some otters, a hippo, an elephant and some birds. The animal show seems very sloppy, the host talked way too fast for the audience to be able to really take in what she said. The design of the route is weird if you walk along one route you miss a lot of things. Overall, pretty disappointed."
All animals are no where to be found. Alot of enclosures are being renovated. The frozen tundra is open but no animals(their polar bear died last year).We think Malaysia Zoo is way better. Not worth the price.
"I visited this place with my family and frankly I think this place is overrated.Firstly, the place is quite big and you'd be better off taking the tram ride with your tickets.Well, that's one thing, next the animals are so scattered you'd have to walk quite a bit. And even on doing so, you'd see 3 elephants, one lion, a couple of hippos and giraffe among the more exciting animals and then it's pretty much the same animals as you'd see in any other zoo really. So my point being, the zoo being reviewed as the best in the world is overrated. I would not call it that. It's just another zoo.If you've got kids, then you might consider visiting. Else, save yourself some.time and visit the other places in Singapore.Hope this helps."
Food expected price not cheap but then food is not hot enough when served.. taste is not gd also very disappointed by paying this kind of price . Need to be improvement when come to food as not much restaurants inside not much choice..
"The zoo is very well kept and service staff is also very happy n helpful resulting in happy visitors.But the same may not be true for the animals in the zoo.The present day zoos have transformed from caged animals to animals living in bigger fenced areas that resemble their natural habitat.But the space is too small of wild animals who are used to covering miles n miles of ground in a day. That is evident in the sad faces of the animals - some look sluggish, some are restless going round n round the same fenced area.I didn't come out as a happy visitor."
Much less than advertised in my opinion. There were lots of animals but the place was not particularly interesting or unique. There are much better things to do in Singapore.
"We decided to visit zoo after reading positive reviews.It was easy to get to by MRT. However when we arrived we discovered that you cannot just buy one ticket, you need different tickets for different areas. We decided on the 'River Safari' and the main Zoo.The River Safari is mainly a walking activity with a short boat ride on the reservoir at the end. We thought it was informative, and it concentrated on the importance of conservation. We enjoyed seeing the pandas.We paid extra for the Amazon river experience, this lasted about 10 mins and you don't really see many animals just lots of empty enclosures.We then visited the Zoo. We did not enjoy it at all. Some of the animal enclosures are really small. The exception is the orangutan enclosure where they have more free range. The giraffe space was very small and the hippo area even worse. Some enclosures seemed to have missing animals for example 5 were advertised but there were only 3 there and staff could not explain where the rest were. We know the polar bear had died but the area was still open.Some animals look distressed, the ostrich was pulling its own feathers out of its back and one of the white tigers was pacing backwards and forwards.We left this 'attraction' feeling quite sad for tha animals and could not recommend it."
"Yah, we really dissatisfied with this zoo. Value to Satisfaction is very high gap. Very hard to find animals, most of the hiding. Distance between exhibitions are too far. So most of the time we will walking seeing trees or asphalt.Lack of staff around making harder just to ask more information.Not recommended for kids below 7th. They will easily exhausted and stuck in stroller or simply crying. Don't bring elder also, the path is not wheel chair friendly."
"Ok first up we made the mistake of going on a public holiday. This should be avoided at all costs the place was a zoo (pun intended)Really packed with people and all the events where completely packed. Seeing the animals felt like you had to elbow others out of the way or get elbowed out. Then come noon and heat kicks in to make the experience that much more painful. So our tips would be go supper early, right when it opens and do not, repeat do not go on a public holiday. If you follow this could be a good experience."
"Generally, a nice setting and some nice exhibits, but the experience was rather stressful due to the large crowds."
"Tickets for Tram is purely a waste of money and time. We bought tram ticket for 2 Adults and 1 kid. On average, we have to wait for about 20-30 min before we can board the tram. There is purely nothing to see while on the tram. And it might be way faster if walking."
"I couldn't help but think why the Cheetah and Puma (one of the fastest on the planet) has such a small enclosure. The Hippo also had small confines going back and forth. They seem to be doing a good job with entertaining customers, but if like me you care for wildlife, put your money towards something more beneficial."
"Too far away place with normal variety of animals. I don't recommend to go there especially the price isn't low.. also, don't think to have zoo river trip."
"Most exhibits were aged and rundown. Many animals were solitary and others appeared unhappy, staring at walls. Exhibits were behind scratched or dirty perspex making it difficult to see or photograph animals. The advertised water bottle refill stations were few and far between, cheap and ugly refreshment trucks were much easier to find. There was a tacky dragon exhibit with plastic model dragons around and a 'Sponsored by Game of Thrones' section that really felt out of place in a zoo. The trams for people who don't want to walk are annoying, very frequent and make it dangerous for kids as they share the main circuit route of the zoo. There is a new section being added to the zoo which will be finished in 2020, I can only guess that once finished they were being an overhaul of the existing zoo. Anyone who has been to a good zoo should skip this until 2020."
"This must have been state of the art in the Seventies, but today is just a old zoo needing heavy refurbishment and a mission revision.Not worth a minute if you are a tourist, also considering it is not close to downtown.An outdoor escape if you are a resident with kids.Yes, perhaps the vegetation is exotic, but go to national orchids garden if you like plants."
"Good zoo but sooo busy and the food is a disgrace. Every place was packed, couldn't get a table, queues for ages and then ate substandard food. The zoo itself is nice, good animal enclosures and easy to get around."
"We went to the zoo on Xmas eve- it was packed. We waited 30 mins to get tickets, then once inside we waited to get on the tour bus for 30mins. We saw a few monkeys, orangutang, chimps..... was nice to see them swinging about in a less enclosed environment than other zoo's. The kids did enjoy the climbing frame. Overall it was really unorganised! Wouldn't recommend or go back.If you do go take mozzy spray it's fairly full of them as expected."
SO disapointed... I hoped to see the animals in something that lokkes as much as their Nature as poissible but some of the animals did not have that much space. We had to leave the tent where there was an animal show because the Music was so loud and it felt totally wrong to see the animals in that position... The way they feed the animals is not glose to their nature... I felt so sad. I have seen much better zoos in Denmark! The Rhinos and tutles where Nice to see though.
"Not satisfactory, Bcz some animals missing and some keep in hide because water level high during raining e.g. white Tiger. Zoo keeper told draining pumps not working on 11th Nov 2018."
"Not bad as a zoo to spend the day at, we didn't see many animals as most were either hiding or sleeping. Was expecting to see a Panda but didn't! White tiger was hiding and couldn't see. Lots of walking, suggest u get a tram ticket. Zoo is far from city, be prepared to pay 20$ each way by taxi."
"No doubt infrastructure is great, but wild animals like white tiger, puma, leopard etc are lonely, felt bad for these animals."
I have visited Zoo with my friends in total 5 young kids and i was surprised i could not find water to drink. I found two top ups areas but they are too far each other. I cannot believe is no drink water at vending machine. How do you think I can give to my small kids to drink coca cola and any other similar juice in a very hot weather. We reached the Zoo at 11am and left at 5pm almost dehydrated.
1. Lesser animals over all2. It's not interesting unlike last time I visited few years ago.3. Going between shows is kind of difficult.4. Tram is not so useful
"We had a very hot humid visit here and found it a little disturbing. The animals were in quite small spaces and looked sad, doing repetitive actions, walking back and forth etc.To get there just take a taxi from the city, very cheap. Pre buying tickets will save you standing in line for 30 minutes or so.Maintenance was dodgy with some cold drink vending machines not working and general facilities a bit run down. Allow 3 hours maximum to cover the whole thing if you can stand the heat, humidity and crowds that long."
Singapore Zoo does not have the charm it used to have 3 years before. Most of the animals are not there. Free ranging Orangutans is a voodoo. Lions look pity and not healthy. Same with other animals. Below standards.
"1. Went to the zoo on a Sunday and was shocked at the number of people there. Queue to get tickets was 15 min, that itself should have been a warning not to go!2. The daily animal shows were at over capacity and they had to turn people away at the entrance, even if you showed up 5 min before the showtimes.3. The 'Ah Meng' restaurant had atrocious crowd and service management. They rolled down the shutters and turned off lights a mere 2 minutes before they took the last order. If you are not going to provide patrons with a place to eat, please warn your poor customers before they buy food in your restaurant!4. We give 2 stars for the diversity of animals in the zoo. Everything else was unfortunately poorly managed in our experience. Not worth going on a weekend - you have been warned!"
"Be prepared for a lot of walking and not seeing many animals.Check the weather forecast before going, avoid visit if there's any sign of rain."
Everything was boring for my kids.Nothing special they said.And it was too hot.The foods was spicy and expensive.
"A nice and fun experience for families. But also a very expensive one. For entrance fees is already 30$ per adult, it does not cover the cost of tram rides which is $5 per adult... where in the past, tram rides are free.Feeding animals is $5 which i think is fair price for the experience. There are lesser animals and alot of walking involved. And the animals are so hidden in their enclaves you see nothing... Like example the white tigers and the seal. Heaps more they can do to change the place."
"All the animals show is getting bad to worst, pls make is more fun and enjoy so that people can have good memories back."
I don't see anything special on this zoo.The tickets are expensive for nothing.The shows are very boring compaing to the one in Thailand for example.
A tourist trap to avoid...too few animals covered in lush greenery...some empty cages too...overpriced
"had a panic attack packed in like a sardine in the food queue. felt like an injured beetle in an ant swarm. tried to escape but a rigid young man, barely more than a boy, led me back to my tray and called me ridiculous and held it for me the whole length of the line like my frustrated father. hot like the dickens. drew a picture of a marmot. still haven't been reimbursed for expenses."
1) main entrance monkey can only heard but cannot be seen2) some animal cannot be seen3) animal not lively4) feeding orang utan presentation by zoologist cannot be heard properly5) ticket price is expensive for $27 person even after promotion when book online
"Singapore Zoo closes door at 6pm everyday but from now till end year, it welcome visitors to a mesmerizing night walk trail in an interactive, illuminated forest - as part of 45th anniversary of the zoo.This experience will treat visitors to a mesmerising multimedia experience around the enchanted world of the Singapore Zoo after dark.Rainforest Lumina at Singapore Zoo will open from 1 July 2018 onwards. Admission time will be from 7.30 pm to midnight. There are 7 entry timings daily. Last entry will be at 10.30 pm.Admission costs for Rainforest Lumina are $22 per adult and $15 per child. *Take note that admission to Rainforest Lumina is separate from admission to Singapore Zoo and Night Safari.*The experience is designed by Moment Factory, creators of the original Forest lumina in Parc de la Gorge de Coaticook, Canada.There are NO real animals but only virtual animals. Two interesting part was the ""Sing Like An Animal"" - With your voice(Sing or scream), bring light and awaken the digital creatures at the Zoo's iconic White Tiger enclosure. Very beautiful!The other was ""Play Like An Animal"" - Fun & short interactive exhibit ' Bunny hop to summon the Creature Crew.Most recommended for families with small children, those with teens/teenagers usually will be there to take their Instagram photos. And we see many!"
"We recently visited Singapore and we had booked and paid for a trip and entry to the Singapore Zoo thru our hotel but still had to line up to get our tickets when we got there. That took forever as there were only three of the eight booths open and they were very slow. Everyone was getting very frustrated. As we were leaving there were still lots of people waiting to get there tickets and still only three booths open!Most of the primates have great enclosures with plenty of room but felt very sorry for a lot of the other animals pacing up and down well worn tracks all the time.Wouldn't recommend it as one of the must do things in Singapore. Plenty of beautiful parks and gardens, giant trees, light show city tours etc."
"The environment was great, a lot effort to maintain the place. However most of the animals are staying alone or just 2-3 together. It's heartfelt loneliness to see the animals like that!"
"Bought the Zoo tickets online instead of buying the River Safari tickets even though I was on the River Safari website as the websites are very confusing and not simple to navigate. Upon arrival, we found out that me had actually purchased the wrong tickets and asked the staffs if they could just do a swop for us. They were inflexible so we ended up having to pay even more for Night Safari tickets."
"Small place and in comparison the Mysore and Delhi Zoo are far better. I strongly recommend to everyone to visit as they are much better. However, the display of the animals and the animal shows saves the day for them."
"Don't be fooled into thinking 'only 20 tickets available' as the website states means this will be an intimate experience. We went this morning.. with about 100 other people. It was OK, but the food was average and the line to get a photo was long.. and if you don't want to pay the 55 dollars they want for a photo they have taken - you might get 2 average photos on your own camera, if you're not being pushed out of the way by others.Sad to say this was a bucket list item for my wife that did not live up to the expectation."
pretty good spot for weird peoples. and im kind of mad at the angry animals that was picking on me but yeah what to do
"I'm singaporean and I expect the zoo to maintain high standards at al times.When I reached last Friday, I saw two guys on a park maintenance vehicle coming out from side gate, one who was smoking. This is not a good image.The food at the food court needs to be changed. It cannot be managed by general workers. The food standard cannot be low. Food standard cannot be Low or standard. It has to be excellent.The handicapped toilet beside the food court did not have tissue paper when I went.Overall, the zoo was nice. But there was nothing special. Special as in something that makes people want to visit again. Everyone was just nice and doing their job. There was no novelty or 'something to do' at the zoo.I was there from 11-5pm."
"Believe me. It's not as great as any indian zoo. The roads are cleaner ,but the the no.of animal species is less. The maintenance is average..I expected lot more from Singapore."
Did not see any shows at all though we were there from 12.30-4.30pm.Not much activities for kids. Very poor
This zoo is ok but it is on a par with melbourne or Sydney. I expected something fantastic. It was just ok. Maybe if you live in a city without a decent zoo then this has a wow factor. But for us it was underwhelming. Added to that the Babboons and polar bear were not on exhibit. The tram ride was worthwhile as it meant we didn't have to walk the whole zoo in the heat.
"Very disappointing to witness no action by zoo staff to educate the many badly behaved young children with their ambivalent parents seemingly content to cause distress to the animals by shouting, screamingly and banging on the safety barriers to attract their attention. Surprised to see that the zoo condones such practices by its failure to intervene. Even worse, the standard of cleanliness of the main restaurant was dreadful, especially for such an otherwise clean country as is Singapore. The tables, chairs and floors were covered with previous diners' food detritus, filthy. The catering manager should resign. These two issues spoilt the visit for my wife and me."
"Everyone talks about it but it is not worth it. Animals have small spaces to stay. Nothing great about this Â« classic Â» zoo. I have seen much better ones where animals seem to have more space and be more respected (like Beauval in France, best zoo). Too expensive for just a walk in a park where you can see a lot of turtles, some elephants in a small peace of land, 3 giraffes..."
"To start on a positive, there are some animals that are treated really well at this zoo. The smaller monkeys for example. It is nice and clean and the maps etc plotted around are very helpful. Now for the negative.... the majority of enclosures are too small and boring, and have further cemented my hate for zoos. The polar bear looked SO sad and had absolutely no privacy - this was probably the worst enclosure we saw on our visit. The cheetahs had a tiny area to run around in - not enough to satisfy their pace. The lions looked sad and had a very boring enclosure. They need much more room to roam around - and judging by other comments, I'm GLAD I didn't stick around for the show. WHY OH WHY can visitors pay to feed, touch, and have photos with tortoise? It's appalling and very distressing. I can appreciate the educational purposes behind the zoo - and I have no doubt they try... but I wouldn't return for another visit."
"Went here on a Sunday and it was over crowded . Long lines for everything , we could not feed single animals 7 not watch many shows which was really disappointing"
"We visited the Zoo as part of a trip to Singapore. Unfortunately, the day we visited, the Zoo had a very large number of visitors, way more than the Zoo's capacity.There was a rush everywhere we went.1. They ran out of wagons, and given we had two little kids, we were counting on that.2. We had paid for the guided tram. However, lines were so ridiculously long that we gave up and just walked3. The lines at the food kiosks were really, really long. We had to wait 25 minutes to get a smoothie. The food line was even longer, and we didn't go there.Eventually, we gave up. What little we saw showed promise of a good Zoo we'd like to see. But the rush was so bad, we couldn't enjoy anything. We left after seeing very little.We suggest to management that they have a capacity cap. It's better to turn away people at the gate. At least those who are in can fully enjoy the Zoo. I would have been much happier if either I was not allowed to purchase the tickets online (as Zoo is already at capacity) or even if I was turned away at the gate.We ended up getting in, trying to make a day of it for a couple of hours, and then giving up and heading back dejected and disappointed. More than the cost of tickets/taxis, we felt the pinch of lost time. Given the rush, we (and so many others) would have better used the day to visit something else in Singapore."
I have visited many Zoos but unfortunately this Zoo has far lower animals compared to the Other zoos. Infact the India Zoo in Mysore and Hyderabad are far better and bigger compared to Singapore Zoo. Too much hype created on Night safari as well Can be avoided.
"I couldn't get to see anything cos of the rain, i wanted my kid to see animals but all animals has gone in cos of e rain. By the time e rain settled it was already 6pm."
"Zoo was beautiful and our favourite thing was the free range orangutang exhibit. Food was also reasonably priced. However we watched the elephant show... And it was really sad to see how elephants were poked with sharp hooks so the elephants would perform tricks to the audience. Hooks were covered with feathers or cloth, so the audience wouldn't notice them."
"The best thing about the zoo was breakfast with the orangutans even though there was hardly any cooked breakfast left at 9.30 am. Coach got there late and then rushed us through to sitting area, The elephant show was great. Wish someone had mentioned how hilly the zoo is, felt sorry for mums struggling to push pushchairs uphill. I nearly passed out with the heat!"
"Perhaps, Singapore isn't able to manage something that is natural. Completely missable. I guess the Mysore Zoo is far better than this one. The only highlights of the show are the live shows that they have. Do make sure to be present at these shows well before time. Do take time to locate the areas where these live shows are conducted and believe me you would take time to locate those areas. The mapping of the Zoo is so pathetic that it is very confusing to locate any area.The only highlight of the Zoo is the 3 live events that they have - Elephant show, Sea-lion show and Rodents Show. Don't miss these as you can be up close and personal to the animals.There is too much to walk and though you might take the tram, still there is nothing much to write home about. I guess Mysore Zoo wins hands down."
I visited the zoo 27 years ago and loved it. This visit was quiet disappointing. The environment and gardens are great but the number of animals and interactions were poor. The animals looked despondent . We visited the night safari after and this was much better even though it was very busy.
"One of the main reasons why we stopped off at Singapore was to breakfast with the Orang-utans. We had been before and then they actually took tea with us, we fed them and one even sat on Michael's knee. Now the whole attitude has changed and there is no contact with the animals - it is considered demeaning. Elephants can no longer kick footballs and parrots cannot ride bicycles and Orang-utans can't be fed. Shame but there it is. I actually think that on the previous visit the animals actually enjoyed our company. So, dear friends, no more stroking the cat or taking the dog for a walk! The underlying principle is good and worthy of support but in practice a bit over the top! Google it and you will see some folks actually feeding then Orang-utans - forget it, there was no contact that I saw. All that happens is that about two hundred folk are shepherded into an average buffet breakfast (no criticism of that) and then in turn groups stand in front of the rather bored looking animals, have their photo taken and then spend the rest of the day trying to avoid the sharks waving their prints in front of them and expecting an exorbitant price for the privilege! Blatant money grabbing!Having said that a lovely zoo and we will visit again. Next time we will take a better breakfast in our hotel, avoid the hotel to hotel tour on the way to the zoo, see these magnificent and lovely animals in their normal enclosure rather than during their humiliating exposure!Overall the animals appear happy and loved, especially the polar bear, though even he or she (which? I couldn't understand the Singaporian accent of the guide) seemed lonely, but not so the visitors many of whom echoed these thoughts. I am disabled and remarked to my wife that it was pity that mobility scooters did not seem to be available. She investigated and found a large group of them parked behind the reception centre. I am not surprised there were so many parked for the price they asked to hire them was so ridiculously excessive that I preferred to brave the agony of my osteoarthritis rather than line the pockets of this money grabbing organisation.The food outlets were all good and varied and certainly prices were very fair and they certainly weren't money grabbing!Will be back in the future but in the meantime would like the organisers to know that I am fortunately not penniless and happy to pay my way but I do resent being ripped off!"
"I cant believe that there is a polar bear at this zoo, in the heat in a small enclosure, Had I known this I would never have gone as it reminded me of the polar bear at Bristol zoo in the 1970's.In some ways the zoo is ok lots of good environmental information.but I also thought that some of the enclosures were too small and others overcrowded. I left feeling heavy hearted"
"my parents and my kid together trip to Singapore, but they learn little english, Night/Day Zoo aren't available for chinese family, any show of them are english."
"Left early to experience the early morning breakfast with our primates relatives. It was a experience that was both great and sad to see how the exploitation of these beautiful creatures was occurring. Don't think that your the only tour to do breakfast, as we did, there would have been at least 200 or more people on different tours to have the so called breakfast with the primates. Then you line up for photos with them. You can see it in their eyes they look so sad. Its all money, creed, and it's just not in Singapore, it happening everywhere. The zoo itself is a wonderful experience, but I must say that I think Sydney zoo is better. Anyway that my opinion, everyone has their own."
The worst experience was there are only 2 toilet cubicle for unisex use at the kids water park there. Animals show was bad which only last 15mins with so limited animals appearance. Quite disppointed I am sure to those tourist that travel so far to visit the zoo.
"The water in the water play area was grey and murky, the filter is clearly not working efficiently. Also, rubber padding on floor was broken to pieces and there were sunken holes along many areas which are risky to children falling and hurting themselves.Mgmt is clearly not looking at the maintenance and safety of this children's water play area."
After reserving Breakfast with the Orangutans we got there at 9.10a.m to find the restaurant jam packed with people and were advised we could enter for around $140.00AUD and that the Orangutan viewing would be for 30 minutes. The bird attraction and dinosaurs were both closed for maintenance. Our kids were the most excited about the Lion and White Tiger and neither of them were to be seen in their enclosures even though we doubled back twice. The gardens and jungle surroundings made it feel luscious and authentic but there is lots to be improved!
"Been there 3 times in past 5 years. This time no improvement and honestly quite boring. The attraction too much ""lecturing"" instead of animal show."
"Just went to Mandai Zoo on 16 September 2017. The last time i have been here was over 15 years ago. Came here to accompany my wife.Pros:1) animals you won't be able to see in a city like Singapore2) the animals in glass enclosures were better as you can see them up close3) was able to see the animal show about monkeys/apes & snakes - the highlight for me was the snake handler walked around for audience to touch the snake: i was able to pet the snake for 2 seconds which i never had the chance to do in my life - that was very interesting!Cons:1) It was raining on & off. The entire place though it has covered walkways was not all covered so we were wet: the management should think about upgrading the place since Singapore is always raining. They didn't have umbrellas for sale so we had to wait for 1 hour for the rain to stop2) Many of the animals were just sleeping or very far off so we couldn't see much. About 50% were like this. The design of the zoo was not good.3) There aren't many signs so we won't able to tell where the next exhibits are. Very confusing. Bad map.4a) VERY lacking in variety: if you see the map - a lot of animals are MONKEYS lol4b) Missing animals: camel, tiger, seal/walrus, horse, deer, different kinds of goats, buffaloes, wolves, foxes, bats, etc, etc. The big cat sections was also SO disappointing5) The dinosaur section got to be the lamest thing I have seen.6) the snake / reptile sections is VERY lacking: there are so many snakes species out there lol!!I really do not know how this zoo gets its award. Certainly not world class lolIf i am the in the board of directors, i will fire the CEO. Don't waste time unless you are a city dweller & never seen animals before. Not much improved since 15 years ago."
Don't get me wrong I didn't expect to sit shoulder to shoulder with an orangutan. However this was a tourist circus with little opportunity to see the Orangutans other than queue to have your photo taken.Breakfast was very good plentiful and lots of options but I expected to eat my breakfast and watch the Orangutan s have theirs. Instead they wait until most people have had breakfast and then the Orangutan sit on a tiny platform so you basically end up watching humans queue to have a photo taken.My advice have breakfast elsewhere and see the Orangutan s in their enclosure for better viewing and photos.Must say I preferred the night zoo somehow you don't notice just how small the enclosures are....
"Not as interesting as compared to my many visits with family more than 20 years.The polar bear really looks like in bad shape and where are those huge crocodiles, hippopotamus ...etc ?"
I felt disappointed because they only have 1 panda & the ticketing staff didnt say that panda locate in river park so we bought the safari park ticket which have no panda while my main purpose was to see panda. Later on we bought the river park ticket but they also couldnt inform us what the best time to see panda. So we spent much only to see sleeping panda. Not cool at all.
"We purchased out Parkhopper Plus tickets online, which worked out well. The tickets entitled us to entry to both the Zoo and Jurong Bird Park, a River Safari Cruise, a night safari cruise and travel around the Zoo and Jurong Bird Park onboard a tram. Firstly, the tram, Queues were long at most of the tram stops. From the trams the only animals we saw were giraffes and a few primates. It also seemed that most animals were sleeping, which made them hard to see or find.hile the Zoo is well laid out, it is a very long walk to try to see everything. Next, the River Safari... the brochure/zoo map indicate it was a 1 minute walk away (see photo). Beware... that was only to the entrance to the very long and hot walk to the pier for a 15 minute cruise partly around the reservoir. The only animals we saw were a glimpse of a rhino, a giraffe's head and some birds. Chatting with other visitors, we found out that the night safari is the same as the day cruise, but in the dark... and with that very long walk to the pier and back, and no guarantees that you will see any animals. We are both in our late 60s, and thought we were at least average fitness, but that walk was very taxing in the humidity."
"We paid $300 + for two families, for the breakfast with animals. The Ah Meng Bistro. I wanted to treat my friends, but I had to pay the zoo entry fee AND the breakfast, so can't just pay for the breakfast as it is in the zoo itself, so you are required to pay both. That was just annoying! I just wanted breakfast at the zoo and they had me pay for the zoo fee! Completely ridiculous. So the breakfast was really nice. Then a guy in a green shirt started speaking and made cheesy jokes. Such as: ""I know you kids don't think suagr looks like a vegatable, but guess what, it does (Shows a sugarcane)"". I think his name was BOBBY. He started telling people that we can take pictures now with the orange monkey. Dunno what they were called. We went up to take pics. Orangetans?? Then a lady who worked at the zoo helped take some photos for us which didn't come out that well, but in the end we got clear pictures. You also had to buy the pictures if you wanted them. Then BOBBY took out the ball pytron thing/snake/whatever. He showed it to the front row and but didn't show it to the back part of the restaurant where we were sitting. You also couldn't choose your sests. So overall, I was pretty disappointed. I feel that this wasn't that kind of special breakfast. It was sorta regular. My friends weren't impressed either."
The food was not good and and its only doing good as there are no other options inside the Zoo which are good. The food is expensive also.
My wife & I are absolute animal lovers and hence were hesitating in visiting the zoo as the sigh of wild animals in enclosures puts us off. But Singapore does things differently & we thought the Zoo here must be a nice one where the animals are treated with love & care. But to our dismay we found that most of them were in really tiny enclosures and the red bottom baboons looked like they had some sort of disease with some having really really tutor like bottoms. Unfortunately there was nobody from the zoo around for us to get clarity on this. There is too much walking involved and the signages are confusing so you will find yourself walking in circles on numerous occasions. There are Elephant & Sea Lion shows which we skipped as we wanted to see them animals in their natural habitats and not in a circus where they are torture in order to get them to perform tricks.
"I don't know exactly what i had expected from the Zoo but after all the good reviews certainly more than what we got! The entry price of 33 Dollars is very high and apart from some monkeys which were climbing right above our heads there was nothing special to see! Also i dislike that for most animals there is only one public feeding the whole day. If you miss this, you will watch the animals lying in the sun doing nothing. The animals seemed to be not energetic and i felt sorry for them sometimes.Also i dislike how for examplr the lions are next to the zebras and even have eye contact! So there is predator and prey in the direct line of sight, which must be stressful for the animals i assume! Some animal's caves also seemed way too small! I am unhappy with my visit and wouldn't visit it again!"
I was disappointed with this attraction since I was expecting more of an interaction with the animals walking around you. Don't expect that. They were definitely not in cages but they were on specific sections in which you can see an electric fence. The variety of the animals were not much and I have to say that the tiger was in a cage and was stressed out with all the noise near the theatre show of the zoo. I wasn't really wow-ed with this attraction.
"It's a lovely zoo but be careful as their payment platform very often double charges transactions. Even weeks after your visit. And they will never refund you. They know it's a scam and do nothing to fix it.Also, forget their customer services. They never reply to any emails."
Was there on 20 Nov 2020. Overrated and expensive. Many exhibits closed. Boring. Avoid. The plus points are easy parking and clean toilets.
"On local context..all zoos, aquariums and etc are way too expensive. Not friendly to domestic tourism. Not very friendly or cost effective to attarct locals.They remove the main discount on local. The solo free entry on birthday residents."
"As a local, its ridoculously too expensive. Unfriendly for domestic tourism.They removed the solo birthday free entry of residents."
Do not give these people your email address. You will be spammed with several emails a week and unsubscribing won't work.
"Very disappointed in our visit. The kids particularly wanted to play in the splash zone area, and we walked them all across the park only to find out all of the kids sections seemed to be closed and/or shut down. Very disappointed kids resulting. It seems this is going to be ongoing for a week or so, but very little information given. Advanced notice of this online, at the entrance or on the maps would have helped us plan our visit better and manage expectations."
"Crowds and crowds of people. The management of the zoo obviously failed to organize the crowd. We wasted too much time standing in long queues, first one was to purchase the tickets to the night safari, 2nd one was to enter the zoo are, 3d one was to take a van which we finally still missed. Then too little time left for us to see the animals because we had to go back to our bus. We paid a lot of money just to run on the zoo paths and see a few glimpses of a night animal life. Highly disappointed."
"If you like a zoo to have more shops&vending machine than animals, cheap buffets, loud music attractions, depressed animals in small habitats and an expensive entry, this is the place to go. Observe the huge collection of plastic animals. Stuff yourself with pop corn and crisps and sugary drinks whilst watching some depressed sea lions do their trick under the shouting of an overenthousiastic animator. Compared to the domes&botanic gardens, which are epic, this was the most depressing visit in Singapore. A zoo should be about animals not about using them for the amusement of visitors in outdated shows. Many of the habitats are shameful, which is illustrated by the frustrated behaviour of the animals. Time to rethink the whole thing, in the mean time I won't be back."
"I'm NOT an animal lover but as I'm in Singapore my friends said they wanted to visit the zoo as they had been told how amazing it was.WRONG!!!We went on the Night Safari tram. OMG those poor animals. Well the ones we could see. The elephants, lions, deers, bears etc looked depressed, sad and to be honest drugged up. The poor elephants looked like they had been attached to the tree stumps.When we got off the train we were all so upset, disgusted and overwhelmed we decided we couldn't stay any longer. A member of staff asked if we were going out and we said yes because we couldn't look at the sad depressed animals. He said they are depressed because it is raining. REALLY!!!We asked to speak to the manager but he wasn't bothered and told us to fill in a feed back form. I told him he wouldn't do anything with it so we won't bother.I couldn't take any pictures as it was so distressing.I wouldn't recommend this disgusting place to my worse enemy.STAY AWAY"
We have an autistic son who we wanted to take to the zoo for the day. A lot of the workers weren't very helpful to us despite being told our son had a disability. In particular the older guy who does the tram rides told us we had to wait longer to get on the tram! Different not less mate.... I can see clearly you haven't had to experience what it is like to raise a child with a disability.Water park area was very run down and dirty. Bandaids were floating in the water. Yuck!I suggest that the workers at this place receive some sort of education on working with children with disabilities as early they don't have any training in this area.
Very Long queues at food places. The zoo should think about increasing staffing levels during holidays.
"Don't go if it is raining and it rained throughout our visit. Everyone was soaked to the skin. There is no where to dry off, as the aircon in the pricy restaurants puts you close to getting pneumonia. There is limited cover from the elements.There are a lot of areas, which the zoo states are being renovated and will open soon. This didn't help us as it will be our only visit.Couldn't even bother waiting for another soaking at the Night Safari, even though this was included in the exhorbatant price for the tickets.Definitely one to avoid if it is raining, especially when they try to fleece you for every penny that you have."
Well all I can say about this zoo is it has the least amount of visible animals I have ever not seen you are better watching the nature channel not worth the 77 dollar entrance fee for two so give it a miss
Maybe for kids sorry I had gone left early long taxi drive poor value for money must add some people appeared to love it
"I had visited the Singapore Zoo October 2019 with my family, wife and 2 young children.I had exited the Singapore Zoo after completing the River Safari at approximately 5pm to 5.30pm. We, as a family, then queued accordingly to take a taxi. There was a long queue at the taxi stand which had the Regular Taxi using metered fare and the Premium Taxi at S$50/trip. The first 3 bays of the taxi stand were occupied by Premium Taxis. The staff of the Wildlife Reserves Singapore who were managing the crowd and another lady who seemed to be a promoter for the Premium Taxi service, were trying to convince passengers to take the Premium Taxi, which the people in the queue did not want to. For some reason, they were not allowing passengers to move down the queue to the Regular Taxi neither did they ask the Premium Taxi to move when there was no fare available for them. After almost 15 min to 20 min, passengers in the queue decided to walk down the lane to take the Regular Taxi. The staff of the Wildlife Reserves were not helpful towards these passengers.When I decided to also walk and take the Regular Taxi, I enquired from the staff, a male, as to the reason they were not helping us to get the Regular Taxi. In response to my enquiry the staff started raising his voice and shouting at me. The said lady promoter also joined the staff in shouting at me and my family. When I requested to see the name on their badge, they blocked my view and when I asked to see the manager they became belligerent with me and started shouting and using abusive language towards me and my family as well as showed threatening behavior. This caused my children to become afraid. I then walked on to take the Regular Taxi and several taxi drivers refused to take my fare. I boarded one taxi, and the taxi driver actually refused to take my fare, was rude to me and insisted I get out of his taxi. When I finally obtained a taxi, the staff, the lady promoter and the other taxi drivers blocked the path of my taxi, refusing to let the taxi move and trying to detain me. This went on for several minutes until finally a senior person of Wildlife Reserves Singapore approached the scene. Unfortunately, rather than solving the issue, it only got worse as the man, who is a Senior Manager, exacerbated the situation and accused me of being rude to the staff and causing problems. They threatened to call the police and I requested them to do so as at this point I was afraid for the safety and security of my wife, children and myself. They did not call the police to solve the issue and continued to harass us badly. The Senior Manager angrily gave me his business card and rudely challenged me to report him if I wished to do so. After much harassment our taxi was finally allowed to move.I have complained to the Tourism Board of Singapore and Singapore Zoo. I am still waiting for them to answer me properly."
"Weather was hot, expensive tickets. Was very sad to see polar bears in non artic conditions. Elephants and other animals chained and made to do tricks."
We waited forever to get on tram. There was a chap controlling queue who had no idea of moving people on. Completely hopeless. Families were waiting for over 30 minutes in hot humid conditions. Disappointing.
Not enough animals. Very artificial. We were disappointed. I would not recommend to anyone. Too expensive.
Was very much looking forward to seeing the zoo but very disappointing! Incredibly hot and muggy (not their fault but nowhere to escape the heat for a breather) as the small crowded restaurant was not air-con and absolutely uncomfortable. At $42 entrance fee then another five for the tram very poor value. Worst of all though were the very small areas for the animals. Totally inadequate especially the larger animals. Not surprising was the fact that the pandas and the polar bear no longer exist. Very hard to get easy public transport out to the zoo so paid $30 each way via taxi. Total waste of money and time. I thought Perth zoo wasn't the best but it beats Singapore's hands down!
Very costly for the experience. Hardly any animals to see / all were asleep. Lots of areas closed off due to maintenance work which was disappointing. Better to spend money elsewhere on other experiences in Singapore!
Nothing to see. Only 1 or 2 animal inside the cage. Place is too small. Ticket price is not cheap. Not worth visiting. Lastly BORING.
"So I am by no means an expert in zoos, I am no David Attenborough, but I can recognise stressed animals and there were more than a few in this zoo. The two worst were the leopard and the Pygmy hippos, both were suffering with zoochsis (repetitively pacing) and both seemed to be in a huge amount of anxiety.There are other things to please they claim huge success with the orangoutangs and that is to be applauded, but the whole African area is not good, one zebra and a wildebeest in too Amal an enclosure and the giraffe is another, why not combine the two areas.Will I ever go again no not.Would I recommend it very much no"
"Singapore zoo rightly is famous throughout the world. Indeed, the Safari adventures are great ! However, the old zoo is showing its age. We visited over Easter / ANZAC day holidays and found a lot of the animal attractions closed or 'unavailable' with apology signs up offering free Safari visits. The clientele consisted hugely of school day trips; so snakes of 30-40 children duly trooping round each exhibit and totally clogging the KFC restaurants and toilets. The one show we did 'catch' started 40 mins late and lasted 10 mins. Large areas of construction were underway for new exhibits, so expect construction noise and traffic until complete. Staff were similarly dispirited. A bad, bad day ! Even the Tiger was sick !"
Looking for hyenas. But it wasn't there. Food and drinks were overpriced. Some place are still renovating. Mouse is hungry but cute.
Misleading poster on the administration ticket. Staff not properly train to give correct information. Disappointed.
"The main carpark is under construction and there are long queues of cars going into the zoo. We queued for an hour and were told to go past the carpark and circle back to turn in. When we reached the front of this ""second queue"" the traffic warden turned us away and said there was a change of plan and that they would only allow one queue going in. I protested and said I was in that first queue and was turned away but the warden said there was nothing they could do. Thus we had to leave the zoo without going in at all. It was an incredible waste of time and my children were very disappointed. Needless to say I was frustrated and upset, this as nothing short of shameful.The zoo should also consider some form of notification / signs leading up to the zoo to indicate that the carpark is under renovation so people driving have some understanding of whats going on. The notice on their website disappears after a short time so its easy to miss; just make the warning permanent until the carpark is fixed."
"Expensive to get in but I thought it was going to be worth it since there are no cages...Through the gate and monkeys running on the roof wild, I smile and my heart smiles.Get to the larger primates and my heart sinks as the island enclosures are tiny; good vegetation and we'll constructed to mimic their natural habitat but alas tiny. Photos to demonstrate.The rhinos and giraffe are the most heartbreaking, couple of hundred metres max then shut away at night.Sealion show too they have been blasting music as I walked by to test their speakers- these creatures do not do tricks in the wild.I feel so guilty coming here, it's upsetting.Sorry this is so badly written but I'm really lost for words."
"First of all I need to thank your management for your tasteless marketing efforts to scare my 3 year old toddler not once but twice leading to endless cries and great fear shivering for her life. Having nightmares at nap time and bedtime.She was looking forward to the anticipated zoo visit today to see her favourite animals she read from books. We had been flying her around a few good zoos and farm stay in a few countries to give her that childhood experience.She entered your zoo entrance excitedly only to be scared of your fake dinosaur roars and scary looks. Immediately the crowd could hear her screams as if she had entered a haunted house fearing for her life grasping tightly to me yet screaming with fear when we HAD NO CHOICE but to walk through the scary creatures for 5mins. And before we left we HAD NO CHOICE but to pass by the stupid creatures again and she was shivering and screaming for another 5mins.Then she began to calm down and enjoyed her animals exploration and had a happier moment walking in zoo when it was time to leave the zoo, she suddenly jump up. Yes she JUMPED and fell down on ground and running for her life clinging to me when she heard the scary dinosaur roars and haunted looks.She had always like to imagine dinosaur world to be fun and interesting. After today visit to the haunted zoo. She told me "" Mummy I do not want to go to zoo again"".We had visited a few reputable zoos in the world like few states of Australia and few province in Japan and she will really enjoy the wildlife getting close to kangaroos and animals. Zoo is the happy word she reads from books and television cartoons. She had enjoyed around 5 to 6 zoos around the world since she began flying since 8 months old infant to visit wildlife.Thank you Singapore zoo for letting her fear going to zoo and scream for her life when she saw how scary zoo is.Have your marketing team not have the basic understanding that the zoo are for kids as young as infants to toddlers to children and adults? It is supposed to be family friendly creating that fun and welcoming factor for especially children?Have your marketing team not thought that the scary dinosaurs may scare younger children maybe below 5 years of age or not every child may adapt to the dinosaur? To have dinosaur world is a good idea but forcing ALL your visitors to accept them by placing at your zoo entrance and exit after 1 big round around the zoo is really tasteless in promoting zoo.You could have created a separated space just for dinosaur fans or older kids for their imagination to run wild. They HAD A CHOICE whether to step in to visit the dinosaurs and not HAD NO CHOICE but to face them.Due to your tasteless and brainless efforts to force ALL VISITORS to face the haunted creatures. My child now define you as the haunted place. I told her during her nightmare sleep that this is not a zoo and mummy promise you that we will never step into that haunted place anymore. Singapore zoo is a total failure with brainless marketing efforts."
"I loved being able to get close to the animals. However I got upset to see the lions, tiger, leopard and cheetahs looking very distressed, angry or sad. These were the animals that I thought would excite me the most but unfortunately I left feeling like this zoo wasn't giving the correct attention to these beautiful animals and wished I didn't bother paying and supporting something that seemed cruel. Won't be visiting again."
"Animals look sad and bored of life. Too little animals in the habitats. By far the most boring zoo I have been to.My advice to tourists:Don't waste your time going to the Singapore Zoo. The zoo in your home country is probably way better, nicer and w happier animals."
"Visited on 25 December Christmas holidays. After whole day collection of 4 stamps, staffs told unable to do the redemption because is limited for the day. Highly advise organizers to plan your stamps/prizes before you give instructions to visitors. Waste our efforts and children are not happy at the end. Disappointed."
"I bought family tickets online (2 adults & 4 kids) from a Singapore Zoo agent vendor. This is not suggested as the Singapore Zoo will not allow direct entry to the zoo and will still make you queue to retrieve tickets from the physical ticketing counter at the zoo.A Singapore Zoo staff told us that if we had bought directly from the Singapore Zoo website, we would be able to enter the zoo without having to queue to retrieve tickets which have been paid for in full. The queue was estimated to be between 90 mins to 120 mins.This totally beats the purpose of buying tickets with full payment online (SGD175 single visit) to save time. The queue at 12 noon was up to the taxi area. It was not clear from the online Singapore Zoo ticketing vendor that our ticket purchase would give us different zoo access rights.Buyers beware!We ended up spending another SGD250 to buy an annual family pass.The Singapore Zoo should accord the same treatment to their ticketing agents and allow consumers to have direct entry to the zoo or totally stop agents from selling entrance tickets on the Singapore Zoo's behalf. The success of the Singapore Zoo as a family destination is solely the responsibility of the Singapore Zoo and should not allow such unfair incidents to fester.I wonder if the Singapore Zoo management is even aware that you are putting your consumers through so much dissatisfaction and hassle.Annoyed consumer visiting an otherwise top class zoo."
Websites claim to be selling zoo tickets but they are 3rd party suppliers. The tickets are valid but the collection point is a lie. When you purchase tickets on line you don't have to queue for up to 2 hours with a voucher. The voucher that you are issued on line will not work in the express voucher redemption line and you then have to line up with everyone else all over again.Purchase your tickets off the zoo website but make sure it is the zoo website first. *****DO NOT PURCHASE FROM singaporezoo.headout.com *****The staff at the zoo don't care where you bought your ticket and won't help.The zoo is beautiful and well laid out. Don't worry about the crowds as everyone sort of disappears.Catch the train to Ang Mo Kio and then the bus across the road - number 138. Cheap and easy to navigate.
"Not value for money, over crowed, disorganised, 45mins in queue to redeem tickets which have been bought online, 1 hour in queue for the night safari. Huge waste of time and money. We feel that we have spent our day waiting in queues for not much to see.Not recommended!"
"I am local and hav every visiting the zoo every year. What used to be a full day visit and loads of fun for the whole family is a disappointment now. The zoo has been segregated into river safari, night safari etc to the point that we end up paying entrance fees for 3 different parks instead of one to see the same animals that was once part of the zoo. Everything is so expensive!"
"Most of the animals are removed, how disappointing! Not recommending it to friends and family anymore!"
"Area not well maintained and alot of areas are closed for renovations. animals are getting lesser compared to previous years. The dragon and beast event are not even real animals, I wonder why they even put it inside the zoo instead of real animals."
Zoo employees at the entrance gantry is not helpful at all. They gave us a very bad experience. The zoo staff are do not have any empathy. Need to improve on their service level.
"We are residents here and yet we pay just as much as a tourist! Why is that? Should Singapore Zoo be only a tourist attraction? While Singapore has other places to go and let the children enjoy during their school holidays, those are very minimal, my kids still prefer the Zoo. But had to disappoint them by telling them that it's way too expensive, restrictive and disappointing. We had to go all the way to the entrance for some water refill because the water sold inside was $2.50 per 500ml!!?!?!??!!!!! So we had to spend $20-$30 for that whole day? Do you find that convenient or child friendly or easy to go and spend a day in? Food is expensive and don't even get me started on the quality! Huge queues we had to wait at to get food. Paying $8 for chicken rice? A coffee is ridiculously expensive! Terrible experience doesn't even cover our experience that day. Sadly we won't be coming back! We were a group of 5 adults and 5 children below 9yrs old. We all agreed that that would be our last visit there!"
Never experienced the zoo with this much crowd on a Friday - kids were free with accompanying adult.Water park at Kids World had as many kids as adults. Staff to control just kids to access the water area would have made it better.Tram drivers were almost running over us as we navigated thru the crowded pathway.Regularly visited the zoo. By far the worst outing we've had.
Unbelievable that there are only half the ticket counters open. I am writing this after standing in a queue for the last 30 minutes with no sign of it moving in a hurry. I cannot buy tickets online as I have a SIA redemption voucher that can no longer be redeemed at counter 1/2 as per the information booklet. Not good enough for a 'top' tourist attraction.
"Maybe you think you already have enough signs in the zoo, but I constantly got lost while I was following the signs and trying to find either the tram stops, or restrooms, or attractions. It's extremely difficult especially when lots of us tourists also have to deal with kids while we are trying to figure out the directions.Also, the purpose of the tram is so vague. Lots of people actually thought it was like the train in Disneyworld, for you to take a brief and general look at the whole park. But your tram only serves as a transportation, and we sat in the tram for half an hour, without seeing almost anything alive, except for a few larger animals.Also, your restrooms and trashcans are significantly in shortage. We had to run for 10 minutes, ask quite a few staff, with crying babies in our arms, in order to locate a restroom in a rush. And we have to carry trash all the time, before we can dump it into the trashcan.And the restaurants are so short staff and seating. When it's all packed, a long line in front of the cashier is only helped by JUST ONE staff. And your zoo is actually the most expensive that we've ever visited around the world, (tram cost is also usually included everywhere else.)Gees!"
I purchased ticket online.Yet I still need to queue for the ticket like everyone getting on the spot. So tell me what is the purpose for me getting online. So what it is the 3rd party. I'm still paying it. We are getting it prevents to have sure a long queue. So what is the purpose u let 3rd party have it. Must well u stop it.
The animals didn't look very happy and were walking back and forth in their cages. Was not very pleasant to see this.
"We booked the package with the river safari. This latter was about the length of a theme park ride and extremely overpriced. We found the weather very difficult ( clearly not the zoos fault!) but from what we saw, the animals were in pretty small enclosures. We were disturbed to see performing animals advertised..Whilst food was expensive, I didn't see the queues other people have mentioned.This zoo was not for us."
I bring a friend with the 1 for 1 promotion. And thankfully it's one for one if not its really not worth going any of the attraction close n animals shows has gone lesser
"The elephants were performing tricks, very sad to watch. Not what I expected! The animals enclosures are also very small."
Kindly never in your life visit this place caz there is nothing inside and very expensive compared to the show type. Please save your time and money by not going to this particular show. In one sentence its a loots your money and time as well.
Visited zoo. Got there at 11.30. Waited for 30 minutes to obtain a ticket before we even got inAdvice - pre-purchase your ticket before you arrive.
"The reviews are overrated, especially for the entrance fee. First we were informed that buying ticket online would save time queuing up. We were wrong!! The queue for online purchase to exchange for the real ticket is much longer than the queue to buy ticket directly at the ticketing counters. The location of the zoo is basically in the middle of nowhere in the jungle and yet there are only a handful of choice of foods we can buy to eat. Then the tram ride to get to one animal kingdom to another.. the queue is always quite long. The number of animals present in the zoo is quite limited, probably there are only two or three animals per species. For example, there are only 3 elephants, only one tiger, one lion, one panda. And most of the animals we saw were sleeping.There is also problem with the weather, it was very hot it was so uncomfortable. Worst zoo we have ever been to."
"I bought the tickets via trip advisor by this Agency, I went to the zoo by taxi not by their driver when I reached their I found that my tickets has been cancelled because the driver is no longer in the zooSo I forced to buy new tickets"
"The stroller was nonsence for thier terrain,...There were four of us me wife and my children 3 n 4 yo,... the stroller wheell was very poor for the terrain on the zoo and the controll of the stoller was not for everybody toothe sign and the map wasnt good enough too. There were so many small path without sign and not charted at the mapThe annimal it self wasnt easy to spotNot recomended if ur travelijg with the young"
Thundra pathetic.Only 1 white tiger.1sun bear1 Puma.I visited the zoo about ten years ago and really enjoyed it than. Don't think I'll recommend it to any one ever again.It's unbelievable that family who bring their own sandwiches are not allowed to consume it at the foodcourt although we purchased drinks but you allow people who are hogging the seats with no food to sit there.
Very hot and humid environment. overly crowded. Animals are sick of watching hundreds of humans passing by. Peoples are enjoying freedom while animals are suffering from being captive. Very sadistic feelings.
"We absolutely loved this zoo- many open enclosures and the animals look happy and well cared for. I would have given it 5 stars EXCEPT after we witnessed the elephant show which unfortunately really tainted our visit.You cannot have a zoo and advocate for animal welfare, and educate us regarding the cruelty of training elephants when YOU have a show where your mahouts use sharp hooks to force them to perform stunts.Hiding the hooks with colourful tassels does not wash with us, I'm afraid- you can clearly see the elephants being stabbed and forced to make loud noises.For the 4th best zoo in the world I am bitterly disappointed that this is still allowed to happen. I would not visit this zoo again and advise others not to do so unless they are willing to support elephant cruelty."
"This Zoo seemed to really care for its animals, the majority in large enclosures. I was really enjoying my visit but both my wife and I had our suspicions confirmed with regards to ""the elephant show"".3 elephants paraded in front of a cheering crowd forced to do tricks and stunts and stabbed with a sharp hook disguised with colourful tassles if they did not comply.Such an upsetting and archaic experience at what appears to otherwise be a Zoo passionate about animal welfare.I would not return and advise others not to until the humiliating and degrading elephant show is stopped."
"Visited Singapore zoo on Thursday . All the animals were sleeping in the shade in their enclosures and appeared well cared for . The enclosures did appear small .However the real tragedy was the elephants . They could be heard trumpeting out of sight , no doubt being razzed up for the show by the mahouts. When they eventually appeared it was pitiful and distressing . Elephants were completely DEAD in the eyes , no doubt habituated to the poor treatment by the mahouts with spikey sticks . Nobody wants to see these majestic pachyderms doing stunts or tricks for the crowd . The elephants appeared to have chain marks around their legs . Shame on Singapore Zoo , Shame , Shame , Shame ."
"I was planning to go to the zoo, but when I saw performing elephants with Mahouts wielding submission hooks, like circus animals, that is NOT good animal welfare !!I'm happy to come back when the elephants are freely swimming and roaming around their enclosure."
"Despite all the posters and ads, only $0.50 cents of your ticket goes to conservation.The animals have tiny enclosures, are often dirty and malnourished. Some of the animals are very clearly stressed and in bad health. The polar bear is dying on display, and apparently scheduled to be put down this month. The single lonely tiger walks in circles constantly, to a point that he created a mote. Just sad.The breeding program is a complete failure and that is due directly to the conditions the animals are kept in. Even the 2 pandas are kept separately and can't even see each other."
"They keep polar bears here! in singapore where it is usually around 30 degrees. This is torture. Do not pay money to watch animals get tortured. They are also confined to small spaces and are forced to do tricks for us. If you enjoy watching animals suffer, this is the place to go to."
Totally a waste trip. I left 2 hours after entering the zoo . Not worth the money. Some of the places was upgrading. Very few animals that can be seen.
Visited the zoo Friday this second time unfortunately they now have a polar bear in a tank. This I think you will agree is not ideal for this type of animal the enclosure was small the bear looked unhappy with it's head balanced on a small token piece of ice this from a place that advertises and promotes conservation
"We were horrified to see three elephants led out to raucous applause encouraged by the MC who were then made to kneel down and lift a leg up to the crowd in salute.Three handlers were also prodding the elephants with what appeared to be spike-ended sticks. This is shocking.We had previously read that the riding on top of the elephants was recently banned in response to growing activism pressure - which was a good sign ahead of our visit.I would like to know what acts of cruelty these amazing animals have experienced in order to domesticate them for such a show called ""At Work and Play"".This exhibit completely let down what was otherwise an amazing zoo. I would encourage others to visit only if this elephant performance is abolished."
"As zoos go, I can see why some people thought this might be good. Personally, I don't see how caged animals can be good at all and this visit just reinforced my opinion that to do this to animals is just wrong. My wife however thought it was good. All a matter of opinion it seems."
"This was a joke. I thought it was the famed Singapore river safari and was taken to the zoo and shown some absurd pictures of 7 rivers around the world and cages with some animals and insects that were brought from these areas. Ridiculous! It took in part of the area of the underwater aquarium as well. No guided tour as advertised. People were walking haphazardly in different directions.The only sign of a river was the Singapore river flowing close by. and here was I thinking of a river safari by boatIThe young zoo attendants hadn't a clue about helping visitors, probably because they were not very conversant in English - absurd not to have staff who can communicate with tourists. When I asked them which location I was in, since I wanted to take a bus back- although I paid for transport back with the hippo duck tour I was told it was not available- I was told I was in the zoo!Don't be fooled by the hippo duck brochure. other tours may be ok but after my experience with this, I shunned all further duck hippo tours.Suggest they rename it as a 'habitat tour of the zoo' A real disappointment."
"Food and beverage were expensive plus need to queue for very long. Directory of attraction can be further improve. Animal were usually sleeping which is kind of sad, it remind visitor that they were unhappy to be trap inside, double sadness. Kids zone can be further improve, it's so yesterday concept which doesn't seen to interest my nephew. Ambience smell of the stations can be better."
"I would love to be able to endorse Singapore Zoo, but sadly I cannot. The polar bear is in an awful enclosure with absolutely no privacy - except at night presumably? Even when the bear is in its sleeping quarters the bedding is pushed right up against the glass, so that members of the public can get the best view possible, and spend their time banging on the glass.The elephants have to 'perform', the various big cats are all in enclosures that are too small. I heard a 'keeper' shouting at the otters while they were being put away for the night.There are many 'opportunities' to pay an extra 5 dollars for feeding/viewing the animals. The zoo makes no attempt to show off any of its breeding/research credentials - if it has any.It is a real shame but it just seems like a glorified theme park. We saw lots of animals, which in itself is fascinating, but I came away with a feeling of animal exploitation... if they ehomed the polar bear, and stopped doing silly animal shows it would be a much better experience."
"FIrst of all, I must say it is pretty amazing how this zoo treats animals, you can see, compared to other places that animals, specially monkeys and chimpanzees are beeing well treated, having said that, I really cannot forget how heartbroken I was to see how desperate the polar bear was. He couldn't stop repeating the same movements, you could clearly see that he has the sindrome of confinement than many animals which are caged suffer... they suffer from stress because they cannot follow their natual instincts and run, fish, walk hundreds of km and have an adequate and healthy life. Singapore is a very warm city and for sure it IS NOT MADE FOR A POLAR BEAR. Please do something about it, if you really care animals you may see that this is inhumane. Also having cheetahs and tigers in such reduces space is something you should consider...Animals are made to be free, I visited this zoo because I thought it would be so different and i must say i was surprise, but I cannot ignore certain things and I observed the bear for more than 15 min it was disturbing and heartbreaking he is clearly ill. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, HELP HIM, FREE HIM, but do not ignore otherwise you are just contributing to his suffering."
"I have bad experience with the tram service. The assistance officer check que but didn't tell us that we need to carry our own wagon, as the first tram driver was so nice help us because he saw I have my parent with 3 kids.. so we didn't knew we have to carry ourselves!! The second tram, he saw us left the wagon there because we thought he can help. He didn't tell us anything then tram she off. Then we yell driver to stop, the assistance dun even bother to assist, he just walked away. My old Father have to jump down the tram to take the wagon. Then the driver stopped and yell at us, scolded us why we dun take our wagon ourselves? My goodness I was so angry of his attitude. He is young good looking driver, but too bad I dislike his attitude. He should at least check everything is fine before go off, and now he blamed us? So sorry this is the first and the last trip to Zoo."
Just a simple zoo and soo much crowded . And food court is just too expensive. And every country have this kind of zoo . The difference is they operate in night also
Raining and all show is close. Waste my money. I spend $157.i came total 27 ppl with some young kids. No shelter for kids water play. If can i would like to visit again with free entrance
"1hour queue to collect tickets, stood in a snake queue for 1hour, with the smell of frying Chicken being fanned over me.What is the point of allowing you to order tickets from an online agent if you make the customer queue for 1 hour to collect from the standard ticket queue.I had a short time in Singapore and wanted to visit the zoo but this ruined the occassion.Also why is the park split into 4 parks. I don't expect to have to pay more to see certain animals."
It was full day almost raining. Could not enjoy with kid.Could not get rain covers. Not enough stock.It's better if your provide another opportunity for those suffered for sudden rain for almost a day.
"If you want to join the biggest queue of your life, listen to screaming kids, be jostled and pushed, this is the zoo experience for you. Do not be tempted to waste your money... Whilst some of the animals are lovely to see and the presenter at the animal show is really good, this is totally outweighed by the overall chaos at the attraction. A very disappointing trip."
"The zoo provides mobility scooters but to rent one costs more than the price of the entrance fee, essentially doubling the cost for disabled visitors.SHAME ON YOU SINGAPORE ZOO!!!Considering the huge volumes of people passing through here every day the zoo could well afford to offer this service free of charge to disabled visitors instead of penalising them."
"I paid for the tickets with the transportation carts (extra 3$ per ticket)1. The park is too spread out and not well shaded so you will get very very hot and sweaty, the carts are always full so don't bother to pay for one its a big waste of money.2. The animals are nowhere to be seen! they don't have enough animals and they are usually hiding in the shade, moreover they advertise feeding times and then nobody shows up to feed the animals!3. The enclosures are very far away so you cant actually get close and see the animals, you would really need to take binoculars to see the chimpazees and white tigers, they are too far away!.4. The show times are too far apart, you will only get to see one show, they shows are also very based on conservation and not very interactive at all.5. They have 4 different parks with a ticket needed for each park, why not just have one good park!? the ticket is already very expensive.6. The zoo has retail shops everywhere trying to rip you off and get your kid to buy toys, why they don't simply add more animal experiences.7. The one area where you kid can actually touch animals is very very small and there are no staff to assist you child to interact with the animals i.e. could I buy a carrot to feed the bunnies - opportunity missed.8. There are many confusing roads that lead nowhere, also the singage is terrible, I spent most of the day walking in circles.9. They have robot dinosaurs, half are broken and they are terrible, again please just put more animal experiences, I don't need to see robot dinosaurs.10. The staff where useless, they know nothing about the zoo, and don't interact with guests or animals.11. The zoo is very remote and hard to get to, you have to pay for a expensive two way taxi, or take man buses and subways, why they don't have a shuttle bus downtown? I didn't see anything advertised. This makes the cost of a day at the zoo very VERY expensive!Overall a terrible terrible experience, the staff here should visit Khao Keow zoo in Thailand, or even twycross zoo in the UK, its waaaaaay better."
U will find species which u have seen only on nat geo. My kid enjoyed a lot. overall a good experience.
We were here at 10am on a Thursday and there are a million people visiting the zoo. Weather is tooo hot but was raining in the early afternoon. Not worth it. The animals are a few. Waste of time. It's 30 minutes from city center. We took UBER going back to the hotel. The taxi line is about 1 million people waiting. No trains or public bus. Very tiring day.
"This zoo is terrible, the animal enclosures are tiny, a lot of them are just in there by themselves and look bored out of their brain and sad, running back and forth along glass walls continuously. The elephant show is appalling, this is a zoo not a bloody circus, no self respecting zoo would have their animals perform like that these days. And then they just take the elephants away... probably to a cardboard box somewhere until the next show. Not to mention everything is a money grab, $5 to feed the poor elephants, $5 to have an extra viewing. It's ridiculous.The night safari includes mostly deer of varying kinds and 1 tiger. The only good thing about it was that the animals actually had some space to move around without glass walls. The river safari at the beginning is ok, definitely the best part of the zoo.It's very expensive for what it is, there are very few food options and the options that you do have are expensive because it's not like you can go anywhere else.I wouldn't ever go back here, it's by far the worst zoo I have ever been to and it highlights the massive cultural differences in how people treat their animals."
A disappointment. So small in size and very few animals compared to other zoos. Waste of time and money.
"I was here on the 20th February with my friends and at 2pm, we were at fragile forest, an open air rainforest experience.There was a platform that people are allowed to stand on that are only accessible by steps. While being there, there were two monkeys in circles, running across the two staircases, thus preventing anyone from leaving due to fear.However, due to a ""wrong time wrong place"" situation, one of the monkey, while chasing the other, charged straight towards my feet, causing a swell an injury, and a nasty bruise as attached in the photo.The injury left aside, I was appalled at the lack of staff in the exhibition especially where animals are free to roam around. Especially for the safety of the guests, particularly children, it is extremely disheartening to know that there are no staff in the area.Moreover, leaving the exhibition, we tried looking for staff to seek help from but to our dismay, there were none around.Personally, for a attraction that provides a service for people to view animals, the lack of staff is worrying especially when monkeys are allowed to roam around in certain areas of the park."
"Much to do about NOTHING! I read on the plane that Singapore Zoo is rated the world's 3rd best! However, I'm not sure what year that was, because I'm sure it's not one of the world's best Zoo's in 2017. We all know it's just not fashionable to cage animals these days, let alone perform them. The Singapore Zoo still does a very lame Elephant show, with the normal bad taste. However, they are moving away from having animals. They maywel be the first Zoo to have NO ANIMALS! 1 Polar Bear, 2 Lions! In fact it's a lot of walking to even find any animals. The only exhibit that had any life was the Baboon caves. However, they have a plastic display of Dinosaurs. So maybe someday soon Singapore Zoo will be the World's First Zoo to have NO ANIMALS, just plastic ones :))))"
"We really did not enjoy our time here. The zoo is depressing. The elephant show is disgusting. A small elephant was made to push heavy logs through water for the entertainment of people!!?!If you love elephants, go see them in the wild at Kinabatangan in borneo, so much better."
This zoo can be seen in 3 hours. You don't need the whole day. The highlight for me were the pandas eating. I could watch them for hours.
"The animals look stressed, pacing up and down, small enclosuresThe poor polar bear was the worst, I just wanted to go in and save him! In his own just swimming round and round a small pool. Must be such a lonely existence.They make the elephants do tricks which is cruel and not natural although they didn't look like they were hurt.Wouldn't recommend"
"Not a one for zoo's as it is but was really upset with the animals in this zoo. The poor white tiger walked in a figure 8 repetitively and the polar bear looked so lonely, its tank had green algae everywhere apart from the one area he went round in a circle.You could purchase slush in a reusable large drinking cup from most kiosks, however you could not get refills at any cost due to hygiene so you were left carrying empty cups all day (refills are available at any other place we have visited).The train around the park was a good idea, however it cost extra 5 dollars each once inside, as we werent asked at the ticket booth if we wanted it included.There were no wheelchairs available for my dad (as advertised they are free from entrance) when we arrived at 9.30am, however we didn't pass anyone in a wheelchair all day!The zoo was clean, it just felt.like the animals were not well looked after as they looked thin and depressed."
"I didn't enjoy the experience at the Singapore zoo . I won't recommend this tour to any of my friend . Both experience, day time and night safari, was not enjoyable . An exhausting queue, too expensive and smelly . I made a mistake ."
not worth doing.. really too much to walk.. no animals at all . only very few .. that also not attractive
"I really was hoping something better for the animals and regret paying to maintain them in captivity... hard to believe it is good for fast running predators like pumas or tigers to be in a 60 m long space, for pinguins to be packed up together behind a glass window, for a polar bear to be in a pool in the singaporean weather, for orang outans (who change nest every night in a wild habitat ) to be confined in this small environment !!!And even if some are protected here, it is not the case for the vast majority of them. What point is there anyways in keeping them alive if it's for them to be emprisonned?My biggest regret during this trip"
"Second and last time I am going to a zoo. My first was when I was 7years old!Who keeps a polar bear in an open open air enclosure with 35Â°C temperatures and warm water to cool down in? :,(elephants were in an enclosure which took us 10minutes to walk around, and most animals were in cages where visitors were sure to see them.The Singapore zoo doesn't seem like they care much for the animals themselves. They seem to are about the money more than the animals' well being.I understand that without zoos', certain species would be extinct, but what is worse: extinction or no freedom?We were a group of three and we all left with sad faces not saying a word to each other..."
We were told / read that this Zoo was the best in the world. Sorry that is so wrong. We felt so sorry for the animals. It is so HOT and some of the animals have no shade. Best part if you could say that was the train ride.
"This was an exception evening, lucky no rain, we had dinner for 30 in a tip pee and a train tour of the animals at night, the service and quality of the dinner was quite a surprise and would highly recommend for corporates, great bonding and enjoyable evening."
"Treatment of elephants at the show was awful to see, handlers used bullhooks. Cheetah looks thoroughly depressed. A polar bear in the tropics? Dreadful idea. The zoo is lush and beautiful but that's about it."
"What can I say it is a zoo, I am not a big fan, animals should be wild not caged, even large tiger cage the tiger just went back and forth. Zoos suck, period end of story."
Very expensive and why would you want to pay money to see miserable animals? Certainly better than your average zoo but still terrible.
Breakfast with orangutan has nothing to do with the picture u see on the add. 1) your table will be assigned to u depending on the time of the reservation and there only 3-4 tables that actually are close to orangutan. 2) Orangutan are being seated behind the bars with 2-3 guards and they have their own breakfast very far from the people sector. 3) they tell u to line up to take a picture with orangutan ( which u can do without any breakfast just in the zoo itself ). 4) food is horrible and buffet is ovetpriced. 5)Tourist trap.
"I'm not a big fan of zoos but everyone seemed to think this was a must so I visited it. I can't understand all the good reviews for this place.First of all, lots of the ""attractions"" (animals) were being refurbished and were closed to the public.As an animal lover, I feel zoos are torture for them as it is not where they should be, but walking around this place I felt terribly sorry for those poor animals. Lots of then were clearly distressed in their areas and what definitely stressed me out a lot was the polar bear. How the hell could they keep a polar bear (in an open area) when the temperature was 33ÂºC???!!! The poor animal was in the pool of just lying there like he was about to die.Definitely a torture place for animals, I won't recommended it to anyone and definitely wish I had not visited it"
"Where to start? 45 minute ride to get there. Disorganized check in. Queue system abominable. Had to wait like sardines in 90 % humidity for 30 plus minutes, with other patrons jockeying for space to go nowhere. Long back and forth lines starting after rush for positions ( think Disneyland on holiday), still more rude patrons everywhere. Safari ride...saw maybe 10 different animals, mostly deer. Animal show after ride was a joke. Very hard benches with no backs. Should one go to hell upon leaving this earth, you , I assume would be required to endlessly suffer this activity daily. Please, save you time and over priced safari."
This was a complete waste of money - everything very staged with the animals standing exactly where they were shown on the map or not there at all. If you have been on a safari then don't bother with this - it does not showcase the animals in a natural way and many of the animals do not appear to have enough room within which to roam.
"We expected more fun, bigger Zoo with more animals in bigger living space for this expensive price. To see big ice bear in such a small environment or jaguar in such little cage desperately to do the same moves again and again, or walk around in extremely small place was very sad, shocking and cruel."
An amazing sound system that transports you to different places while you admire the multicoloured lights that dance in front of your eyes. Worth visiting
"Whilst all the conservatories require a ticket for entry the supertree grove is free to enter and these vertical gardens are just incredible to see. What's one of the most amazing things about these supertrees are they aren't just there to look pretty but have some pretty impressive environmental features too. They collect solar energy, so they can use their own electricity and also collect rainwater, which can be used to keep the gardens watered. They also have an air filtration system within them that vents hot air and can be used to cool down the conservatories. How very clever!"
"The Garden Rhapsody Show is back at the Supertree Grove, Gardens by the Bay.Waltz your evening away at the Supertree Grove and let the music and lights transport you to a mythical enchanted forest."
Enjoyable during the day really fun with the light and sound performance. we did the skywalk which gave a great view and picts
"This is another amazing feature to Gardens by the Bay. However, it was my 3rd favorite part behind the two domes. Still you do not want to miss this. This are basically man made towers the act like trees in the garden and come alive at night with lights. You will see Supertrees in many parts of the part but the concentration in the grove is the most impressive part. You simply have to see them come alive at night, neither the pictures or words can really describe. This is simply a must see activity when you are in Singapore.We did not have a change to do the walk way; however the grove is simply enough of an experience to walk through. The other good part is it is perfectly position for pictures with the Sands hotel. Do not miss this while you are in Singapore."
We visit at least once a month to see the change in light show (changes monthly). The place is magical and beautiful lit. Walking around the gardens during the evening and then being enchanted by the lightshow and music is really wonderful each and every single time.
There are 15 supertrees in the Garden By the Bay. I enjoyed admiring the supertrees from different part of the hugh park. The night experience here is a must as the trees are lighted up.
pretty during the day and even more at night! You can reach it from marina bay sands tower 2 or via MRT bayfront - just turn right and go straight!I m always coming back to that place since i like long walks and night ambience!ITs free and always going!cheers
"An absolutely amazing place, in the day time it's quite beautiful but at night 'wow' I thought it was quite mesmerising. Lots of places to sit with a picnic and it's all for free unless you want to walk up higher"
Located inside Gardens by the Bay. After visiting nearby places we spent evening here watching Supertree illumination show.
"Was around there the whole day and the light show in the evening was simply just awesome. I highly reccomend that you go see it if you have the time. If you donÂ´t have the time, make time"
One of the best sight seeing spots in Singapore. The light show here is so magical. The artificial trees and the natural plants surrounding it is really a sight. When the light show is on it feels like you are on different planet. You can visit during the day and night time. This is must visit if you are in Singapore.
"Super tree Grove is unlike anything you've ever seen. You can not go to Singapore and miss out on them!I'd definitely say to see them twice, once during the day to take in the magnificent beauty of the structure and ingenuity of the planting and once at night, to the them lit up in all of their solar powered glory at the spectacular light show!Not to be missed! Allow an hour at each viewing!"
"Supertree Grove it's nice to try if you dont afraid of heights, the light show was amazing to watch and my blowing."
We enjoyed the evening light show with all of its music. This is a notable sight that should not be missed.
I always be here every December ( Christmast month ) because a lot of lightings and display to see . Visitors place to be . Stunning!
The tree grove looks lovely during the day but at night it really comes alive. The trees light up in time to the music and is very cleverly done. It is also very moving emotionally. Its really something you have to experience for yourself to truly understand how good it is.
It's great when you see that show at night.But there are some people sleeping there . I really enjoy it. I want to come back to the Supertree Grove many times later.
"We went at dusk as the 'trees' lit up. At 7:45 the 15 minute sound and light show started, 'a night at the opera' which was magnificent, atmospheric and deeply moving. One of the best things I have ever done. We grabbed something to eat at the hawker Centre and waited for the 8:45 show we enjoyed it so much."
There are around 5 supertrees here. Entry is free. Light and sound shows in the evening is a must watch.
When you go to The Gardens by The Bay the light show is a must ..start at 21:00 and is remarkable....music and light show whats not to like
"The supertree grove is really cool, and the light show was amazing and captivating. It's on every night, and it's free to enter the grove and see the light show. If you want to enter the gardens or walk the skyway you have to pay, and the gardens also close in the evening."
I would highly recommend this to all. The dusk show to music and the accompanying light show is very impressive. Must do item
This is a must see attractions by day and night the place is immaculate and with so much to see you can easily spend more than half a day there but the light show at night is absolutely amazing and it is definitely a must see when you are in town highly recommended
This amazing architectural master piece is a must visit at night to see the Light and Sound show.Stay to the end of the music !
"Great experience walking at high level through the grove , excellent views out to see and back to the city . Stunning lights in the evening"
We started the tour during the day and that was good but definitely needed to stay until the evening to experience the entire package. Take the trip up to the walks and see the place as it lights up!
Very magical place . Be sure to wait for the musical show at around 8pm. It light dances to the music that makes it so magical. Different theme on different occasions. My dad enjoys the Mooncake festival one the most as it plays all the oldies songs yet modernize thumps up
A truly wonderful excursion into the surreal. If you see nothing else in Singapore make sure you see this amazing site.
"This is a lovely place to take walks, especially at night. There are two shows daily. The first show starts at 7:45 pm and the second one starts at 8:45 pm. Worth visiting if you are in Singapore!"
We wandered through the gardens for a while before finding a spot to settle for the evening light show. There were plenty of people sitting on the open grassy area by the food court. We managed to find a spot below one of the trees with a center view. The show is magnificent and definitely a great way to end the day!
"I must have seen the nightly music and light show at least a dozen times over the past 2 years and it makes me cry every time!What a wonderful and clever thing these productions are. Please, if you see nothing else on your trip to Singapore, go and see this. AND ITS FREE!Thank you Singapore"
"Very original outdoor gardens which are lit up at night. Great to visit with family, friends or couples. We did the free walk through as we went fairly late and the activities were closed but I can see the activities being very cool being able to go up to the top of the trees."
"Spectacular light and music free show. So good we went two nights out of three night stay in Singapore, Really is a must do thing and cannot recommend highly enough"
Visited last year but wanted to go back again. Simply a stunning sight but daily did not have time to visit at night...next time
"Oh what would a trip to Singapore be without meandering amongst the Supertree Grove. My wife and I had a chance to see it both day and night, although at night it is truly something to behold. Music playing, an intense light show, but mostly the architecture and stunning appeal of these Supertrees will draw you in for hours at a time, almost taking you to mystical movie-like wonderland where your dreams may very well come true. Not to be missed and also Instagrammable forever!"
It is good at any time but do not miss the audiovisual display each evening. There is a charge if want to take the tree top walk
Loved the gardens & ease of use. You rely on only one lift to get to walkway across & down to gardens which can take a while. The light show was worth it. Views from bridge at dusk was lovely with 'egg' light show. Loved it.
"We had spent several hours at the Gardens by the Bay then waited in the midst of the Supertrees not sure what to expect. Some lights came on and looked good, then the light show started and the music , it was stunning. A must see."
"This is one of the main attractions of the Gardens by the Bay. It's a mega sculptural ensemble that resembles trees and beautifully lit up at night with two evening shows synchronized to music. No visit to Singapore should be without a visit to Gardens by the Bay and the Supertree Grove. If you don't fancy walking the OCBC Skyway, the you can also go up the Supertree Observatory instead. In my humble opinion, the observatory is better than the OCBC Skyway."
We had been to the gardens during the day and it was fantastic butwent back the following night to watch and listen to the light show 'Opera in the Gardens '. It was spectacular and an absolute must.
"We viewed them from the roof of the Marina Bay Sands during the evening light show, them walked amongst them by day and later by night. Amazing"
Well worth a visit in day light where you see plants growing up the Super Trees. Also walk up in the canopy. Twice each evening music is played to the Super Trees you are better off watching from the ground. Entry day and night is free.
Enjoyable during the day and really fun during the light and sound performance. I did the skywalk which gave a great view.
"Even at night time, Gardens by the Bay is a wonderful experience. As well as great food courts, the Supertrees demonstrate a creative approach to making chimneys something to admire. As well as growing plants up the outside of the chimneys, each evening has a lovely sound and coordinated light show, with the music varying. The night we were there it was operatic arias and the lights were like a light organ, dancing to the sound."
"A tourist icon in Singapore that one must see at least once and it's FREE! Best time to visit is just before sunset so that you can enjoy the gardens in the day, and the super trees spectacular show at night."
Fabulous its free you've got to go here go at 4 walk around and then you will be ready for the evening light and sound extravaganza
"This 'exhibit' is really something. It is very unique, so well thought out, clever and colourful in it's presentation and highly entertaining. It last for approximately 15 minutes. I would reccommend getting there around 10 minutes before the start of the show, as there is very limited seating, that being a few benches and the low walls around the garden. We arrived just as it started and had to sit on the ground. Following the show there are some delightful gardens to walk around that are very well highlighted along the way. I would also recommend the walk back over the bridge to ( and through ) the Marina bay Sands Hotel. We travelled in by cab as we were staying in town, so the way back for us was through the hotel. A very enjoyable experience all round, and what's more, it's free from ground level. NOTE There is a charge if you want to view the show from the elevated walkway, which would ( I imagine ) give one a very different perspective."
Amazing area in Gardens by the Bay. Beautiful to see in the day & we returned to the light & sound show another night.Scared of heights so didnt go on the walkway but believe it is a great experience!Highly recommended
It was amazing to see the Supertree Grove on our own eyes. It was like a flash from the future. Luckily we could also see the light show in the evening which added on our impression.
When the sun goes down the lights come on. And boy were they worth the wait. Set to opera music the light show began.It was 10 minutes of pure magic and joy. In fact we returned for a second time it was so good. Definitely the highlight of our trip to Singapore and a must see for anyone visiting .Suitable for everyone.
"If you only see one thing while in this fascinating city you MUST see the light show, twice a day 7.45pm and 8.45pm...my description couldn't do it justice, you have to see it to believe it."
This is a part of the Garden by the Bay. You must visit in the n ight time and enjoy the laser show. You will that you are in some different world. On some different planet. Better u carry a towel and lie down on ground and see towards sky.
"Singapore has so much astounding and truly creative architecture per square kilometer that putting more in their park by the harbour might have been forbidden. Yet there they sprout. One has no need to imagine Sci-Fi cities of the distant future. Take in the Super Trees' light show at dusk, the Garden's domes behind you, the iconic Marina Bay Hotel silhouetted ahead and you are there now."
Very fun and worthwhile but I'd go in the morning or night due to the heat. The grounds are a blast to walk around and you can go to the mall for a respite from the heat.
"View of the Supertree Grove from MBS is amazing , such an creative spectacle , partnered with music this is high light for any visitor to the city in the evening"
These gigantic metallic trees soar well over 25 to 50 meters. These stellar structures are design to convert solar energy to provide air conduits to the adjacent observatories and to light up the light panels for the sound and light show each evening. They are amazing during the day to gaze upwards at these trees. It is also amazing to see the tropical vines and flowers that are intertwine around the trunks of these structures. The soaring branches high up offer some shade for visitors below. The spectacular feature begins at night during the light and sound show. All the structures light up in amazing colors and changes to the tempo of the music. Once again there is no admission to this area and you can wander around for as long as you want or just come before the show begins.
"Visit both during the day and evening to get the full effect of them. The night view is second to none though. Beautifully lit and you can get some excellent pictures. One of my favourite things in Singapore, I just loved them so much. You could spend ages wandering around and seeing them at different points and heights."
Supertree Grove must be seen in broad daylight as well as in the night when it is beautifully lit. Both the views are respectively beautiful.
"This is a wonderful Series of gardens totalling approx 100 hectares It's a fabulous free place to visit at anytime but it's evening when it is at its most spectacular. The trees are lit up and there are numerous different gardens to walk through as well as art installations. Why not head over there in time to catch the light show at 7:45pm and 8.45pm daily, stroll through the gardens and maybe grab something to eat in one of the eateries there. Not to be missed!"
"Each evening at 7.45PM and 8.45PM, there will be a magnificent light show held at the Supertree Grove. As a local, my advice to those who wish to experience this is to bring a towel/mat, roll it out on the floor about 15 minutes before the show begins, then just lay on the floor in comfort as you see the light show unfurl in front of your eyes! Pack a picnic if you want to stay there longer. Totally worth it."
"The Supertree Grove was absolutely gorgeous! At night, the lightshow makes the whole gardens light up with different colours and music. It was amazing!!"
"This is fabulous, an engineering marvel. A visit to Singapore is incomplete without Super tree in the itinerary. We visited in the evening so that we can see the light show. The show was marvelous. Saw some people on the top of the tree or in the walkway at the top but the show is fantastic from ground level as one can see in all directions."
"stuck in Singapore a few days what an amazing downtown area with the Marina Bay sands and parks behind it. Lots of restaurants and malls, something for everyone. We stayed at the Mandarin Oriental that has great views of the downtown and is close walking to everything. Greta place for a three day stay"
"Your visit to Singapore will not be complete without visiting this Supertree Grove. To go up, you need to pay and it's not cheap but the view up there is well worth it. Even if you don't wish to buy the ticket, I still suggest you visit this place to watch the free musical light show in the evening."
This has got to be the best 'free' attraction in Singapore. It's free to walk around the vast gardens and Supertrees and you could spend most of the day there. There is an admission fee to the two large glasshouses in the gardens; not cheap but well worth a visit.
"To me, this is the best part of Gardens by the Bay. The Supertree Grove is very pretty in the day, but you must stay for the night show when the trees light up to music. They become very pretty and colourful. Really worth the visit."
I was bloom away by these and i had seen heaps of photos of them as well as people telling me about them but it still did not prepare me for how amazing this place is.
"Watched the night time light and music display, Well recommended. An excellent display for all the family."
"The trees are amazing. The Skywark is great, you get super viewsall across the city. The light show at might is fantastic."
"A lot of people attended the night show, seated all over the place.Wonderful show on opera music and lights.Walked aroundon a passarelle between 2 ""trees"", splendid view around !"
"When in Singapore certainly one of the best things to see and experience.Great in day and spectacular at night with light show, if you can do day and night that would be ideal if you have time constraints then visit at night.I spend 3 days in Singapore and gardens by the bay was the best attraction and Supertree Grove is a major attraction within the gardens."
Go and see the light and sound show in the evening. It is free and well worth the experience. Make sure you read the signs about the super trees and the purpose that they serve
"Great attraction, very colorful at night with a fantastic light show with music at night, well worth a visit."
Visited the Supertree Grove during the day was amazing but not as amazing as the night time show which happens twice every night. Set to music the trees come alive with visual delights. The first showing is a bit crowded so to beat the crowd go to the second same show but less hassles simply amazing it is
"I spent a day at the Gardens by the Bay, including time at the Supertree Grove. It was an impressive sight, going up the Supertree on the Skyway was pretty cool and well worth it.In addition, the Supertree Grove has a light and sound show in the evening called Garden Rhapsody, saw it from the 31st floor of the MBS, it was colorful. A bit of background on Garden Rhapsody, its creative vision is led by Lighting Designer Adrian Tan, and one of Singapore's sought after music composers and arrangers Bang Wenfu. Note that there are two shows daily, at 7:45PM and 8:45PM, don't miss it!Please indicate if you found this review to be helpful, as your click of thanks enables me to remain motivated in creating future comprehensive reviews that will add value to my fellow TripAdvisor members."
"Visiting one of the two light shows at 8pm or 9pm, is a perfect start into your evening in Singapore. As it is free of charge it might be very well visited."
"An absolute must see for anyone staying in Singapore. The Supertrees are impresive to look at during the day and then come to life at night when they are lit with thousands of lights set to an impressive music score. View them for free day or night, you only need to pay for the sky bridge between the trees if you want to view the trees and surroundings from another perpective."
These wonderful tree-like structures just have to be seen to be believed - especially at night! Reminiscent of the Mallorns of the Elves in Lord Of The Rings (okay a bit of a stretch but they are fabulous!) Definitely one of the sites/sights you must see on any trip to Singapore.
"We visited this park after visiting the Cloud and Flower Domes, this section is free. It's absolutely stunning and the walkways are shady. At night there us a light show which is stunning.Definitely worth a visit."
We were there in the evening when the light and sound show was performed. This part of the park is free of charge. Go there!
Supertree Grove is a must see for the daily light show. It is really amazing and worth the stay at night.
One of the most amaising light and music shows my wife and I have ever seen. It is a must see for any one going to Singapore.
"If your room overlooks the Trees then do watch the light show in the evening, or view from the rooftop.Its very good"
"The supertree grove was a sight to behold. The view from the skywalk was absolutely breath taking, as you could see for miles how beautiful everything was. the kight show at night was a real treat with all the Supertree groves lite up to music and lights."
We came across the light show here accidently and never have we seen anything like it. See the videos attached. Awesome experience.
Another gem in Singapore.The vertical gardens are absolutely beautiful.I have never taken so many photos of flowers.The walkways give a great view of all the gardens and the light show at night is first class.The most beautiful gardens we have seen around the world.
nicely done. beautiful landscaping and area. refreshing change from the hustle and bustle of the city.
We visited in the day and went up on the walkway (aerial). This gave great views of the gardens. We returned at night for the light and sound show. This was well worth it. This is a must do if yo have the time and the jet lag hasn't got you.
"The supertree Grove are present at Gardens by the Bay. But you don't need to pay a penny to visit these. The best time to visit these are after 6 p.m as every day at 7.45 pm and 8.45 pm, a light and sound show takes place which is not to be missed.Supertree Grove are vertical gardens home to over 150k plants and so is a paradise for nature lovers."
"The whole garden park is magnificent. We did it during the day but from what I see, would be even more so at night. We did the super tree observatory and walk - extremely worthwhile."
"This show on every night is really not to be missed,we went in the lift to the top of one of the Super Trees,great view,perfect for photos,go early free light show,have to buy tickets for the lift,well worth it."
We visited here both in the day and again at night. There is a skywalk you can take between the trees for S$8 and take in the view. The light and sound show in the evening was well worth seeing. It only lasts about 10 mins but was like watching a firework display all set to music. Get there early to ensure you get a good spot!
A must when visiting Singapore to watch the sound and light show as the trees all come to life is quite amazing and for once in life it is freeA MUST DO
"We were enchanted as the vertical gardens came alive in the night with the mesmerizing Garden Rhapsody light and sound show!'Garden Rhapsody is a signature light and sound show of the Gardens by the Bay, and its overall creative vision is led by award-winning Lighting Designer Adrian Tan, and one of Singapore's most sought-after music composers and arrangers, Bang Wenfu, since 2015.''Measuring between 25 and 50 meters tall, Gardens by the Bay's Supertrees are designed with large canopies that provide shade in the day and come alive with an exhilarating display of lights and sounds at night.'After we watched the Spectra Light Show at 20.00 o'clock, we walked across the Marina Bay Shoppes and through the hotel Marina Bay Sands towards Gardens By the Bay. We passed a bridge with giant floating eggs: 'The floating eggs - a work titled Autonomous Resonating Life On The Water And Resonating Trees - are among seven interactive exhibits at Gardens by the Bay's new art exhibition #futuretogether. The temporary exhibition, launched in conjunction with the Singapore bicentennial, includes both outdoor and indoor elements'.We've saw the Supertrees in daylight last year and now it was time to be mesmerized them by night! Rhapsody show really worth seeing and it's for free as well!"
I visited this place during the day and night. The best experience is at night as you see the lights and they have a light show I think at 7. Very beautiful to see and watch.
"Go and see it at night and in the daytime if you have time, wonderful free experience. Pay for the audio guide tour on the electric buggy to get your bearings."
"I try to avoid hyperbole when possible, but for the Supertrees I think at least a little bit is warranted. The Supertree Grove is quite simply one of the most spectacular things I've seen in a long while. They are a super modern, artistic interpretation of nature, providing awe-inspiring views from all angles and unique experiences during day and night.Go during the day to appreciate the intricate design, and everything that goes into maintaining the trees, down to the detail of all the living foliage growing up the sides. Go in the evening for a completely different experience which is a visual masterpiece complemented by the musical performances that play twice per evening.My wife and I saw the grove at day and at night, and were fortunate enough for our timing to be perfect and watch the entire show from the skyway. It was truly spectacular, and a special moment that I won't soon forget."
"We visited supertree grove both at night for the light show (garden rhapsody) and in the day to walk on the bridge (skyway). These super trees are an iconic image of Singapore and they really are spectacular to see in person.Things to note: Entry to the whole area is free but you have to buy a ticket if you want to go up on the walkway. Very reasonably priced. The signs / online suggests that the walkway is open until 9pm. It is, but the ticket office closes at 8pm so bear that in mind when planning your visit.The light show gets very busy but it's worth it and you can get an excellent view point sitting on the steps at ground level. We walked to Satay by the bay after the lights for some (super tasty) food to wait while the taxi queue died down."
These trees are really impressive. They will change everytime you come back as the plants grow. Spend the extra and have a walk along the sky walk
A visit to Singapore is not complete without a visit to the Supertree grove even it it should rain the light show still goes on and there are areas where you can shelter from the rain and still see the show.
"2/12/19. Depending upon at what time the sun sets when you visit, plan your time to visit around the light and music show in the evening. Our time to enter the skywalk walkway was at 7:20pm. Wait at the end of the line of your group, and you'll go up around 7:30 when it is getting dark and the show is about to start. You're supposed to stay 15 minutes, but the light and music show started in the trees from 7:45-8:00. Lovely and great views all around. Don't miss out on this amazing presentation."
"This would have to be the best free show in all of Singapore. If you only have one night in Singapore, this is a must see. There are two shows per night with lights and music and while you are waiting, you can pay $14SG to go up on one of the skywalks. This is a must for photographers. We went back three times to enjoy the park and the show. High recommend."
Definitely worth a look and enjoy the environment. Planetariums were really interesting and lots of work had been done for the Christmas show.
The Supertree Grove is a part of the Gardens by the Bay. What's more? It's free!! Make sure you go there in the evening after visiting the other parts of Gardens by the Bay. Don't miss the light & sound show. It's mindblowing & will surely transport you to different place
No words can describe how wonderful the supertree grove is.I just wanted to stay there for hours admiring the sheer beauty of the whole thing. So beautifully designed and futuristic. Totally in love with it.
The skyway promenade is short but well worth the visit especially if taken early when the crowds are thin. There. Is a lift up and down for those who do not fancy stairs.There is an evening lights display to music which is both rousing and elegant. Many lie on their backs on the ground to fully appreciate the spectacle. Definitely worth taking in.
Well worth a visit to Supertree Grove. The night show albeit short is fantastic. It's very well organised so that even when very busy there is no shortage of good view points. Both music and lighting are great.
"The whole concept of Gardens by the Bay is like an attraction park but with sense, knowledge, modernity and opulence. One of the best places in the world."
"It was very nicely organized. They kept the lines moving, once you got up to the canopies, the view was outstanding, I was there during the Christmas shows, they just added to the experience. You could see the Marina Bay Sands in all its glory, the Marina and the rest of the park."
"Stood at the base of one of the trees to watch the 10 minute light show at 7:45 PM. It was crowded, so I did not get the best view (arrived at 7:35). I liked the classical music that went along with the lights."
"The cloud and flower forests were ok, the Biennale light-up eggs behind the Marina Bay Sands hotel are awesome, but the supertrees just barely edged out the eggs. Why? They're cool to see both at day -- when you can really see the plants growing around the trunks and you can take the observation walk -- and at night, when the trees light up in a photo-worthy display set to music (two shows each night). You can spend an entire day touring the garden, walking through the grove, and going to the cloud and flower forest. Plenty of food and shopping to be found as well."
The amazing views in this park setting. The experience was complete when I returned at night to 3njoy the spectacular lighted trees and the walk way.
These trees loom above you and are a beautiful sight. Interesting that they are the catchall for all the water used in the domws. Very clever engineering. Wondered about safety in a lightning storm though.
These amazing tree structures have become synonymous with Singapore's Marina Bay area. Great place to be both during day time and at night. The night lights are mesmerising. This is a key attraction in Singapore and I can't believe it's free to walk around.
"These structures in the Supertree Grove have become synonymous with Singapore's Marina area. There are various activities that you can do here, including a walk on a sky bridge from one tree to another one, an elevator to the top of the tallest tree in what's called 'The Observatory', and an unmissable evening lightshow called 'Garden Rhapsody' - although be prepared for massive evening crowds. The grove is surrounded by forests and interesting nooks that you should definitely take your time to explore. In all honesty though, you're not missing anything by skipping the observatory and the bridge - in fact, the view tends to be best from the ground.If you're looking to take good photos, try to find those with the best cameras and tripods loitering in odd spots. For the nighttime light show, up on a little ledge above the Food Hall is where the money shots get taken. There is no denying that this is all very touristy, but it's free to go into Gardens by the Bay and to look at the trees - don't miss this lovely feature."
"The number of clicks we took, from various angles, says it all. Superb combination of human skill and natural beauty."
"There's nothing much to say here. Just go and spend a few hours at the Gardens by the Bay. You have the super tree grove, the Flower dome, the Cloud forest, the light shows, the skywalk. It needs an entire day or two to be spent over here for you to take in all the available things to see here.It exceeds your expectations of a tourist attraction. It is neat. It is organized. You have no hurdles in getting transport to and from this venue. There are enough eateries here to ensure that you don't go hungry. The toilets are clean. There are signs everywhere to indicate to you where each of the points are and how far each one is.I am not going to go on, I will however share a few photographs of the place."
"You can walk in the tree canopy on a constructed walk way, the light show with classical music is worth seeing but bring something to sit on."
Wanted to see these for a long time and chose to see them from the Marina bay sands hotel room balcony lit up at night. The back drop of the bay full of lit boats in the bay was fantasticWe were lucky enough to see the Xmas light show which was good. Unusual and not particularly pretty in daylight but definitely makes up for this at night.
"We didn't have much time to spend there, but my friends and I came to eat at Satay by the Bay for dinner before sunset, then stayed for the 8:45 light show in the supertree grove. We had a great spot (the ground is clean enough to sit on!). The December show is Christmas music and was lots of fun!"
Shows are daily at 7.45 & 8.45 pm and last 15 minutes. There were crowds of people but as you have to look upwards you still get to see everything. Well worth a visit.
We all loved the 8.45pm light and sound show. It creates quiet a magical atmosphere and real sense of community. It is well worth the visit.
Awesome light shows at night. Nice ambience and unique features. Great attraction for locals and tourists.
Stunning. Climbed the top a 15 minute walk. Best time to see is a night when it lights up. Was on the bridge durning the light show which was fun. Need to be in line by 6-630pm in order to get tickets which is about $8 per person
"Take a relaxing stroll and be amazed by the site. You can take a leisure walk and check out the bridges. Entries are cheap but do take note that if there are lightnings and thunder, the entries will be closed."
Another experience of the combination of plants and constructions. All part of the big complex next to Marina Bay Sands.
I've been walking through the Gardens By The Bay quite a lot during the lockdown period in Singapore as a means of exercise. In the early morning it has been really enjoyable to see the Supertrees with so few people around. Definitely a highlight of the gardens.
"A must-go place. Beautiful light shows but it gets really crowded and the weather was really humid when I went the other day, hope to be back with better cooling weather! :D"
"Another weird thing people think of to build. Is it art? I suppose. Whatever and why-ever, I like it and you should visit. You can go up and walk around as well."
"I dodged the Christmas crowds and mayhem, that was to be found in and around the main area of Gardens by the Bay, and headed to this quiet corner. Sat for an hour, read a book, got my people watch on, and watched as the sun slowly set. These huge trees came alive with light...also had the Marina Bay Sands hotel as a backdrop: very Singapore. A must if you find yourself in the area."
"We visited the place during sundown. It was a great sight to see when you are in Singapore. We have had a great time there. Very clean, green, and comfortable place. Loved it."
one of the best places to catch fireworks for New Year countdown or National Day Parade. nice and windy place to chill out in.
I think the area is very impressive and beautiful.The trees like structures are amazing. They look incredible during the day and I guess when they light up at night is quite beautiful.Anyway an amazing place and may be the best part of the Gardens by the Bay. These iconic giant solar trees are one of the most recognizable attractions or symbols of Singapore.
"Standing there (I am to old to lie on my back like some), looking at giant artificial trees light up in time to loud snatches of opera must be one of the strangest evenings I have spent for a while. The show happens twice nightly, its free and sure is something to tell the folks back home about. Go on, you know you want to go..."
"Part of Gardens by the Bay this was visible from our hotel room. Aerial walkways connected the ""trees"". They were covered in vines and flowering plants were all over."
we walked through the gardens and even in the day they are spectacular to see. at night it is just amazing. do not miss this at night when the light show is on well worth the wait.
"Probably best viewed at night, unfortunately I couldn't. It is free to wander around although a good over view is from the tree top walk which does cost a few dollars."
"This is hot, confusing labyrinth in the daytime. Go at night for a visual experience and to appreciate the design."
It's amazing what humankind can develop and that is evident in the Supertree Grove in Singapore. We didn't see the entire evening light show (8:00) but what we saw was spectacular. LOTS of people go to this evening showing so get there early!
"Great by the day and even better by night.The Supertree Grove has Garden Rhapsody, a light and sound show in the evening.Great modern contemporary art, but i guess some people prefer a real super tree better."
Fantastic by day but even better y night you must see the light show it's one of my highlights of Singapore
First time experience for our group.All of us in awe. We did the OCBC skywalkand stayed for the nightly light show.Mesmerized!
"One of the City's major attractions, it draws the crowds but if you are in Singapore, watching the nightly light show here is a must. You can do this without paying to access the overpriced domes."
Good show of these architecturally 'trees' in this area of garden spectacular that would be more at home in a Sci Fi movie
"Show starts at 8pm and is well worth the visit. It's free unless you go up to the tree walk, which is also good and only S$8."
"Had an amazing experience here tonight, with the Light & Sound show at 7.45pm, also managed to ensure we had tickets for the skywalk at 7.40pm. The grove is much more entertaining during the evening with all the lights , rather during the day."
"Went during the day in order to go on the bridge, great views and unique experience but I feel it would have been more magical if we had gone at night."
"The Supertree Grove is a key attraction to visit in Singapore. They seemingly exist without rhyme nor reason. They beg the question... WHY? I wish i knew the answer. Did they cut down some real, living, breathing trees to make way for these behemoths? Probably!They cool for social media posts and taking photos to show your friends though! Definitely worth walking a few steps for"
Nice place to visit in the evening when the supertrees light up. Also there is 15 minute light and sound show at both 7:45 p.m. and 8:45 p.m. It becomes very crowded with tourists and locals during the show timings so come a bit early and find a nice place to sit or lie and relax while watching the show.
I love to come here to see all the lights show but its kinda boring a bit because they rarely change the music.
The view from the top is amazing - 360 deg view to the gardens and back to Marina Bay Sands. I would recommend going both in the day and at night as they are two completely different experiences. Expect a hoard of people and phones everywhere so get there early before the masses. Suggest pre-purchasing tickets online as you save some $$ and allows you to walk into the queue to go up rather than having line up for tickets inside as well.
Such an iconic and beautiful place! I definitely consider it a must see if you visit Singapore. There's also a lot to do in this area. Would recommend for sure!
"The amazing variety of nature on display in the domes is the real highlight of the Gardens by the Bay, but while you're there, the super tree grove is worth a visit. These trees actually serve an important ecological function in the gardens.The Supertree Observatory opened on 27 December 2019. At 50 metres high it is twice the height of the Skywalk. There are both inside and outside walkways. It has great views across the Bay and towards the city, as well as of the Marina Bay Sands. If you're keen for photos, however, the views are obstructed by the supertree itself.Entry is $14, compared to $8 for the skywalk, however unlike the skywalk the tickets are not timed and you can stay up there as long as you like. It gives a good/different view of the light show at night and wasn't too crowded (although had only been open a week so may not be well known yet). There is a small cafe/bar up there as well, although minimal seating."
"Good position, there is so much to do and see in the Marina bay area, near to Gardens by the bay and there are so great views"
"Having visited the area 2 times previously without staying for the evening light show, we were really glad we stayed this time. At 4pm we bought tickets for the walkway ($8). At 6pm we went back to get our assigned time. (7:40pm). We were really happy to be ON the walkway during the 7:45pm lightshow. That was really fun. We really enjoyed the light show and the views. It's something I'm glad we did once. We probably wouldn't do it again. It's definitely crowded. And trying to get food in the foodcourt right by the trees was a 2 hour wait!!!! Eat elsewhere! Food mediocre and crazy long to wait for tables and food. But we are glad we went once and spent an evening there. It feels unique. Go for the evening lights and cool architecture and the fun of walking around that whole area at night. It's a tourist attraction. Not really a place for outdoor play or leisurely quiet strolls through a park or that type of thing."
"These illusory light trees have quickly become a symbol for the whole of Singapore. Like big trumpet mushrooms, they stand in the middle of the park at Marina Bay, just a few minutes walk from the magnificent Marina Bay Sand hotel and the magical botanical domes on the other side of the park. My first thought when I saw these fairy trees was a corresponding one (though larger and more advanced) that was present at the world exhibition in Milan that number of years ago (2015). In the evening you light up the trees in a delicious light show and you can also buy a ticket and hike up between three of the tree canopies on a long footpath, with magnificent views of the surrounding park. I liked the trees very sharply, but found the exhibition with Christmas decorations in the area felt quite unnecessary ..."
"Must-visit for travellers; amazing views which will definitely brighten up your mood! However, do expect to fork out some money as some admissions are not free."
"I wish Greta Thunberg and Donald Trump visit this place one day (same time?). It is awesome!!! I would suggest the President visiting at ~3 am, when nobody is here (the security would ruin the day...). He never sleeps anyway."
One of the most iconic tourist attractions in Singapore - a must-see on your tourist to-do list! Check out the trees during the day and then watch as they transform at night during the light show! Breathtaking! :)
Super nice trees with a spectacular light show and classical music.A must visit. Free show to watch every evening.Bring your camera with you!
"A nice feature of the Gardens by the Bay, these massive metal trees are an exhibit of their own. We were not there at night so missed the light show which sounds spectacular."
"This was a day visit, as we were doing the other sights.An evening visit with all the trees lit up is declared to be a magnificent sight.The though behind the creation of the super trees, to add life and the living art of forest and fauna into a busy city..wonderful!!"
"you need to ask the ticket counter first if the supertree grove show is still going or not. if its about to rain/ heavy wind, they might cancel the show and you wont be able to walk in the supertree."
We took the elevator to the tree walk and enjoyed looking down at the gardens. Then we went down to watch the lights and music from the trees. Great way to spend a few hours.
We visited this place where the Supertree is located. superb viwe of the tree. Do wear hats here during sunny day as it is very hot.
These trees are fake. And they are really big. During the day they look different. But at night they night up and look pretty cool. Nice to look at.
My wife and I visited the the Supertree Grove during the day and it was good but it's far better at night when lit up and make sure to stick around for the light show. I would recommend getting there early as it gets busy.
"We were here in early November and were here during the day. We popped by after visiting Universal Studios. We were unable to visit at night which I'm sure would have made for better photos. Even for daytime it was still nice to see, and our 3 year old loved the nearby water park."
"If you are planning to visit Gardens by the Bay and either of the massive domes, do plan a visit here as well. The views are certainly worth it.But do plan your visit; it can be exhausting walking in the 30s with high humidity, so work out your route first. With the air conditioned domes and the breeze at the top of the Grove walkway, you can extend your energy to enjoy the Gardens.Elevator up and down!"
"As part of our evening Big Bus Tour we arrived at the Gardens by the Bay in time for the evening light show.The bus dropped us off near the entrance and our guide escorted us to a viewing area. It was already pretty busy with few spaces but some kind people made space for us so we could sit down.It was incredibly hot and humid so I was glad I had remembered my fan - not electric, just one you flap about! At one stage we were joined by a giant snail.The music was beautiful and the trees looked amazing as they changed colour.The show lasted about 15 minutes and was lovely, although we did feel there was scope to introduce lasers and fireworks. Unfortunately we have been spoilt by Disney shows, but it was a very pleasant experience.If you get the chance do go and see the show. It's so pretty and a great experience.It was busy when the show ended. We left promptly just before the end and were able to find our way back to the bus."
"During the day these ""giants"" will leave you speechless but its the night show that will take your breath away. Easily accessed via public transport"
"We visited the grove in the evening and stayed for the light and sound show. It was a fun, unusual thing to do."
"After spending the day exploring the Cloud Forest Flower Done we headed out to watch the light show in Supertree Grove. We got there about an hour ahead of the show and still found it challenging to find a decent spot to sit and wait. People gather here very early, and once the show started it was easy to see why. Lights and music combine to provide an inspiring display that is totally free of charge. You have to see it at least once in your trip."
We visited for the evening light show which was lovely. Seeing the trees lit up and the lights dancing to the music was great. The next day we visited the gardens and walked around the grove. The trees are enormous and the air borne plants that are growing up them give the trees a special character. You can get another perspective by going up to the canopy walkway but you have to pay for that. It's just about worth the fee.
These trees immediately make me think of Singapore and I couldn't wait to see them.At night they are lit and look beautiful.I went to view them up close in the day and it's worth visiting.
"We visited the Supertrees by day and then again at night to see the light show. The magical trees are enormous, huge structures covered in plants, and connected by a walkway high above the ground. The night time light show is fun. Visitors simply mill around, find a seating place and sit back as darkness falls until the light show turns the great towers into magical castles of a million changing lights. There are all kinds of interesting stats for these trees, heights etc and in usual Singaporean style, all highly impressive. It is all a bit of whimsy really, but gives delight to thousands."
"When we visited six years ago, the plants were not that far of the ground, whereas today you can see much more growth.These great trees certainly stand out and mark a focus spot in the gardens.We were not there at night, but last time the trees lit up with the night show are quite incredible.There is a new feature being built therefore one of the trees has a fence around it, which does not make for good photographs at the moment.Its also free to get in. Walk across from the MRT or Marina Sands"
"Very nice and the lightshow you must have seen. There are a lot of people watching the lightshow. From our point of view, it's not worth the uprising, because there is a long queue if you want to get up."
"Best seen after nightfall, to see them illuminated, and even better to see the daily lights/music show. We were there in early May, so got the Star Wars themed show of May 4th! Great for travellers of all ages!"
"This is a one of a kind experience which I don't think is replicated ie the trees, anywhere else in the worldThe light and music show, currently at 7.45 and 8.45 pm each evening, is fun. Lasts just under 15 mins. Arrive early if to want to pick your spot"
Sitting and waiting for the evening light show seems to take forever. Perhaps this is how the excitement wanes as the heat and lack of seating take their effect. The music is ok but it is all about the lights. They look great when recorded but seem a little lack lustre when sitting in the heat. While it may be uncomfortable the light show is one of those events where you will curse yourself for not going as well as regret it when you do go. In the end I recommend taking the plunge and seeing it. Seems a shame to travel this far and miss out. In the daytime the grove is also spectacular and a fascinating combination of art and engineering
"These iconic 'trees' are probably one of the first things to catch your eye as you get transferred from the airport to the city. They are metallic 'trees', designed to act as support for climbing plants and to house epiphytes. The trees are stunning in themselves but when combined with all the vegetation, they are truly beautiful. I was pleased to see how high up the plant colonisation has reached and think that they can only get more beautiful as the plant life matures. There is a ""skywalk"" connecting the trees but we couldn't use it because of recent rain. I was not convinced that using the ""skywalk"" would have particularly enhanced the experience. If you have time, I am sure that it would be worth revisiting them at night, when they are illuminated."
Great visit and I do think you should add it which I do think most do. The lightshow in the evening is well-worth it.
We visited as part of the FREE Singapore night lights tour. A wonderful display particularly at night.
"The employee showed me the Super Trees , and the surrounding area, and was very helpful. I also visited the food court there."
Supertree Grove is truly an amazing place to visit. It is such a unique idea and has a tree top walk to get a better view.
"I visited the Supertree Grove for the 1st time today, and booked a ticket for OCBC Skyway. Admission to Supertree Grove is free. However, please note that charges apply for OCBC Skyway. Walking along the elevated walkway was great while enjoying an aerial view of the garden. Pls beware that constructions are going on near the Grove (in front of the food hall) for the mid-autumn festival. The view from above might be distorted.SEE photos."
"If you like to be dazzled by lights and sparkly things then the light show at the Supertree Grove is well worth it. Recommend you take the tour as you learn a little about how the grove was built and how the Supertrees are more than just for entertainment.Oh and as the light show only goes for 15 odd minutes, the tour also takes you to Marina Sands and a night river cruise."
Sit down and watch this garden come alive with lights.while the gardens were great to watch we got there a bit early to get a feed which was poor to average in quality. The lights are a must see in Singas.
these super trees are good and there are some specific locations where you can get best shots in both day and night. from marina bay sands sky walk you will get one of the best view. you can also get down and enter into park for view from bottom.
Supertree Groove is pretty neat and worth a visit while you're in Singapore. Go wander through these massive metal sculptures before you head into Gardens by the Bay.
We had a great time enjoying the sculptures. The best bet is to go at night so you could enjoy it more.
The light show is in twice a night and you have the option to also take the sky walk which we did. Good light show to music and great views of the city on the sky walk. Not too expensive $32 when we went for 4 people.
"It's free and something different. It is very busy though, especially at the weekends so make sure to get there on time if you want a good view. You can sit on the steps leading up to the grove which offers the best view."
The Supertree grove is not as big or grand as i had imagined from looking at pictures! but it is still lovely to visit especially around sunset when the sky colors soften.
"There is a very big field and kids could roam and play freely. Evenings during the showtime, many would simply lie down on the floor and look up at the supertree to enjoy the view. Few eateries nearby it."
Went to see what the hype was about and it as quite good - was really busy as this is free to go and see the lights and music display - so make sure you get there a bit early to get a spot - we left just before it finished to avoid the mass exodusThere is other stuff to see around the super trees so go earlier before the light show starts to fully appreciate what is on offer.
"If you love the lights and nature, you can surely visit in the evening and enjoy the light show here in Gardens by the bay!"
"Be sure to go in the evening as the place, in particular the super trees come to life! The two domes are very nice day or night. Of course they are unique and well kept. So, you have to visit and take all those selfies. Why not!I enjoyed the outdoors, so walking around and exploring the general areas of the park and getting a different views of the near by skyline, dominated by the Marina at Bay Sand Hotel."
"The light show at night is good. Not brilliant, but enjoyable and still worth checking out. Arrive a bit early for a good spot"
"Really brilliant idea and love what they're doing here, the trees are currently about 1/3 grown up so they're not complete yet - but well worth a visit alongside the park and domes. I wouldn't recommend the skywalk, you don't see a lot more."
"Visited with my friends i met in the hostel, during the night and the lights and music is so cool.. Its so fun to watch the light changes so as the music.. I have so much here and great experience.."
It is a neat grove separated into areas. Each area has a description and things are labeled. It is beautiful.
"These super trees are definitely spectacular, and you can view them for free as a part of gardens by the bay. At night there is a fun light and music show which you can also watch for free. If you want to go on the skywalk, it is about eight dollars, and many people say they love it, especially if you can time it to be at night during the show, though it can get rather crowded then."
"Because it was inside Garden by the Bay so the same thing for me, but the light show was worth seeing and you could climb and enjoy the view on the balcony there."
"The OCBC Skyway (bridge) offers a breathtaking view of the Marina Bay area, and its surrounding landmarks. Balmy, and comfortable stroll to enjoy the 360 deg views of the picturesque park, and the vicinity. Great visit!"
"We had seen the lights last year and through they were amazing, this year unfortunately even though we stood in the same place the sound was not as good. Because of this flashing lights without sound just doesn't have the same feel to it. Still a nice evening and a beautiful place. I would suggest to find a spot fairly close to the lights and look up."
This is a lovely park to walk around in with plenty of nature to enjoy. The super trees are very futuristic - reminding me of Avatar and the foliage climbing up the structures strikes a nice balance. It's also FREE to walk around unless you go into the OCBC walkway or the into the domes. Missed the light show since I came during the day.Tip: You can also buy a shuttle ticket at the ticket booth if you just don't want to walk.
The Super Tree Lighting Show is suitable for both Adults and Children. It provided a carnival atmosphere ideal for a family outing.
"Like everything else here, this was first-rate. Gigantic dynamic art, be sure to do the elevated walkway."
I walked through here in the early morning and was constantly astounded by the colours and size of the supertree's - I would definitely want to visit here as part of the Gardens by the Bay.
"Personally I didn't go along the walkway because I have a fear of heights and the walkway, although perfectly safe, was a little too bouncy for me. It is only a short walk though."
"These are well worth a walk round - they are amazing to look at from a distance perhaps rather than close up but the whole Marina Bay area is huge park so it is easy just to walk round and enjoy close up or from a distance. My hot tip is to go late afternoon and see the light show in the evening, i think its around 7.30 - check this though. The show is spectacular and great fun as these super trees are lit up to the beat of the music - it was a retro theme when we went, and altogether brilliant - no pun intended. Completely free to enjoy and in the heat of the evening perfect."
"There isn't a whole lot to the skywalk and light-show at supertree grove but the atmosphere and ambiance is worth experiencing. The queues and ticket process to get up to the short skywalk is rather inefficient and could really be improved but if you're only in Singapore for a short time, it is probably worth doing it anyway! Just manage you're expectations!"
Giant weird artificial trees. Fun to walk amongst them. Fun photo ops in this surreal little parkscape.
"These man made trees are quite imposing and well constructed.To make them more interesting, some construction should be added stop accommodate some wild life live exhibit in them."
"We saw Supertree Grove in the daytime when we went to see the rest of Gardens by the Bay and it was stunning, but we think it was even better when you go at around 8pm at night time for the lights and music show that goes on on the trees, very impressive and fun to see."
"Visually interesting during the day, but a real treat in the evening during the light show. For that you need to get there early to find a good place to lay down under the trees so you can look up."
The light show at night with music is really beautiful. During the day it's not much to see but I would recommend it at night.
"If you are visiting the Gardens by the Bay it is well worth visiting the supertrees and walking up on the path, in the 'air'! They are doing an amazing job with these gardens. The supertrees will look even better when the plants are fully grown and filling all spaces on those trees. Worth a visit if you have half a day to spare."
The lights show was amazing. Be early to 'chope' your seats at the bottom of the supertree before it's too late.
"Cool place. Great potential. Some of the ""trees"" in the grove need more cultivation of the vegetation. The light show we saw had great sound and visuals - but could have been even more spectacularly timed with the beats and rhythm. Still, would probably see again with friends if back in Singapore."
We went to see the light show at the Gardens by the Bay but arrived too late to go on the walking tours .The light show was at 8.45 pm and we just sat back and looked at the most amazing light show.Really liked the theme which was back into the disco era.Was starving and went to the food court which was spotless and had some chicken which put KFC to shame.Great evening and then walked to the Marina Bay Sands for drinks.
"The Supertree Grove is finally coming into is own as climbers and other plants are gradually lover the structure. Several of the Supertrees are actually part of the sophisticated environmental control (some of the towers are part of the cooling, humidification system) for the amazing enclosed gardens at Marina Bay. Never have seen any structures like them....really iconic."
"the trees can be looked at just by walking , to goo on te skywalk between them is at a cost but just to get photos and see what has been achieved was enoough"
"This place is purely for great photos. It represents Singapore as well as the Merlion and the Marina Bay Sands. Honestly, the super trees are much better from afar. You can save your money if you plan to do the walk among the Supertrees. The walk isn't very long and it doesn't make for good pictures if that's what you're after."
"Best advice would be to visit at night and go go of a weekend. If you wish to pay to walk along the high level walkways, be prepared to queue for the experience. Viewing from the ground is free !!"
"These Trees are fabulous, at Night they light up truly amazing . One of the reasons I went to Singapore and they did not disappoint"
"The architecture and build of the supertrees are amazing, you will be amazed by the technique and ideas they used to create this wonderful scenery within the city. It's a good place to hang around but try to avoid weekends as it will be crowded."
Certainly worth a visit at night time for the light show. Go early gets busy for the light show. Gardens are nice to walk around. When finish light show walk across to the shopping centre via the Helix Bridge.
"Really epic sight to see i recommend coming at night time coz of all the kool lights that glow the supertrees it really stops ya in ya tracks and you can take photos, entry is free too, its so big and you just walk around taking it all in its peacefull"
"Well worth the visit. If you get the chance, go up to the top of the Maina Bay Sands Skypark at night and view the Supertree Grove light show - absolutely fantastic."
A superb night walk around the park n beautiful lightning around the trees though at day time it's very hot to stay but skywalk is worthy
Lovely and such a wonderful place to explore. But just sooo sooooo warm. Make sure to bring a fan etc to keep cool.
"Supertree Grove at Gardens by the Bay is simply beautiful. Singapore is generally hot and humid. But let the sun go down and you can start your visit to this tree grove around 6 pm. Without lights it may look a bit dull. But wait for the lights to come up! You might even wonder where you are! It is almost surreal.There is a skywalk to add a new dimension to this experience. The trees are man-made ofcourse. But the natural plants and creeperrs that cover the tree trunks are amazing. Just a stone's throw away from Marina Bay Sands Hotels, you can see the trees and the light show. If you plan to get an up-close encounter, and if you like to see the plants etc in detail, you have to walk towards the grove. So wear some comfortable shoes. It is a lovely walk. You will not be disappointed!"
"It was a nice experience. there is a lights show here at around 7:00 PM. But, it gets a little boring after about 15 Mins so not giving 5 stars.But you should watch the show as it is beautiful"
"Great cultural displays and worth an hour of walk around time. Kids may get a bit bored but then take them to the bio spheres and orchid and plant displays. Awesome. Yes there is a price$ to pay but you will not regret it! Must visit. And yes, it is cooler inside the domes than out in the Supertree Grove which is nice but not the main attraction IMHO."
Well worth a visit. Can be crowded. A must see at night.It's worth joining the line to go up on the walk way.
a little touristy $$ but worth seeing! Lines can be long also make time for the local indoor green/ botanical spaces.
We traveled to Singapore for a few days and it is amazing .The Supertree Grove is best visited at night to see the light show it is also cooler at night but super to see
"The cooling towers are encased with a steel frames, and plants is growing on the frames. This creates an impression of ""trees"". Come in the evening, and you can also enjoy a light show, synchronized with music. It is very enjoyable."
We walked through the Supertree Grove whilst visiting the Gardens by the Bay. We had seen it at night but to walk through it during the day you get to see how large these tree-like structures are .. reminded me of the movie 'Avatar'.
"The build is phenomenal, the fact that they are planted out and growing is amazing, the skywalk feels death defying but I was a little underwhelmed. This is not something for the bucket list."
"Super tree Grove is one of the most pleasant, calming attractions in Singapore. It's located in the Marina Bay Area which is very easy to get to. You can catch a train MTR or a taxi.The artificial modern metallic tree structures are part of a huge cultivated tropical outdoor garden. They provide the necessary framework for plants to attach themselves to grow onto in any direction. At the moment these structures are not completely covered particularly towards the tree tops because it takes time for the different varieties of plant life to cover the entire area which is large as there are many trees.The plants and flowers are of a tropical nature, large, lush, colourful and robust. They are used along side of other exhibitions. In February there were many paper mÃ¢chÃ© fish designed by various parts of the community which added to the beauty and originality of this attraction.The gardens are well maintained. You can enjoy your own picnic here or snatch some fast food just to take time to sit and admire the garden. There are also the two massive domes the rainforest and flower dome close by there are plenty of things to do."
"*** Tips: you should come here at around 3 - 4pm to enjoy the atmosphere and scene until night time when you can enjoy the forest music. Lying down beneath the Supertree for relaxation, listening to music and watch the light. About 15 mins. Bring along coat/blanket to cover your body when lying, but it's clean anyway."
"While in Singapore, we when to the Super Tree Grove which is in the Gardens By The Bay, just behind the Marina Bay Sands hotel.Twice a night this place comes alive with light and music and is so packed we were sitting on the ground to watch his spectacle (if you come early, you can get a seat).The is an elevated walkway suspended from the Supertrees that allows you to walk above the gardens and get a great view of this space .. .what blew me away was the view above the Bismarck palms .. it's is an unbelievable geometric view .. one you usually don't get to see.The light show is synchronized to music and is just awesome .. .I am running out of superlatives.Go there, get a cab, they are so cheap in Singapore ... there were thousands of people the night we were there and probably a hundred waiting for a cab .. we waited twenty minutes as it is all really well organised (there are over forty thousand cabs in Singapore ... no wonder we didn't wait long).It's a great free night out."
This grove is right behind the Sands hotel. A lovely place to stroll the grounds. The tres light up and have a light and music show every night.
You shoul see here at night because of light and music show. You can go up with elevator and walk betwren these trees.
i wish metropolitan cities adopt this infrastructure. they are so amzing. watch them light up at night. you can skip the ocbc runways. too expensive. but the gardens are free
"Pretty fun and imaginative what humankind can create. It's behind the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and one can walk through there after the 8:00 tree ""show"">"
"This is the second time I visited this place. Last time I didn't buy the ticket to the OCBC skyway. I just stood under the huge trees and looked up to the trees. The trees were huge and shaped special. This time I had the ticket to the OCBC skyway but before I got there, I had to go to the ticket counter to book the time because there were only maximum 60 people on the bridge. The view from there was very nice, I could see the theatre, Marina bay sand very clearly. Standing there, you can feel everytime the wind blew."
Other than the light show there is nothing much for people coming from tropics to see or feel. ideal for evening .
Nice to visit at the evening when the Supertree Grove light is on. It becomes very crowded with tourists and locals during the show timings so try to be there early and find a nice place to sit or lie and relax while watching the show.
"The light show is worth watching, but other than that Supertree Grove is a bit of a non-event. Might be more impressive in a few years when the climbing plants on the trunks have made their way to the canopies; if that indeed is the aim?"
"We have visited this venue before. It was great to see the Gardens by the Bay again to see the development of the gardens. The supertree is nice, we have been here when it was a restaurant and watched a great sunset from this spot. Is it worth the cost? Well we suppose yes when you look at the maintence of these lovely gardens."
"Come here at dusk or night if your Insta needs to feed. If your idea is to see greenery, you'd be better off at any of the nearby gardens or parkland. Only would recommend if you've already planned a visit to any of the domes, drive, or just want to take a bit of a walk around in our hot humid weather."
"If you're going to Sands, or Cloud Forest already - this is a great site to see on the way, but not worth a special trip."
This was a bit of disappointment to us looking at the other attractions at Singapore. IT was an ordinary show with the crowd at the end being a big issue to come out.
"We visited the trees and the skywalk during a daytime trip. They were nice, but not anything special. Worth the 8 or so SGD to go to the skywalk, but not breathtaking by any means. I suspect that during the evening light-show it'll be quite different as an experience.Well, at least there wasn't any crowd!"
"We did the canopy walk.....it does not take long and is not too expensive for Singapore. Liked the overview of the city and there are some nice photo opps. But if you had other things that are on your Must See list, this could drop off."
These will be amazing when they are fully covered by plants. At this stage they are only around a third covered. The light show each night is nice to see but not really worth going out of your way to catch them.
"My partner and I love visiting the gardens and thoroughly enjoyed gardens by the bay as a whole, however we feel the supergrove trees and over head walk is best done in the evening.My partner and I arrived 5:30 here to enjoy walking around the supergrove trees during the day light and doing the sky walk before staying for the light show.We could not fault the show at all and found it spectacular. A short 15min show was worth making the trip, but the super grove trees aren't much to rave about in daylight compared to the rest of the gardens!We highly recommend thinking about whether you wanna see the view from the sky walk here as if not then book in for the night walk and watch the light show from above, Or do the walk at sunset then lay down on the ground after to watch the art of light and sound."
"No surprises, it is one of the most popular tourist spots, so very busy and touristy, but the supertrees are pretty awesome to see, especially at night."
"These trees are such a nice structure created but the evening lighting program is not that structured and not so interesting. It can have a theme, a story or anything else to make it really interesting."
"Feels a little like ""Avatar"" to see the photos. the light show with music is a free show and pales by comparison to the light and water show on the other side of the casino. OK to do, and free but not worth walking across town to see. Music was a little cheesy"
"This was a nice night activity, It was really busy and I struggled with the crowds and humidity but the choreographed music was awesome and worth a visit. The queue for the skyway was HUGE and I would not even bother buying a ticket during the night show. Do the skywalk during the day."
"We walked from our hotel nearby in the afternoon, not much crowded. Good to see their ability to create impressive places in Singapore."
"We went to the gardens to see the supertree grove and found it a little disappointing. There is a ""showtime"" I think twice a night where the canopy is lit up - outside these times it is not lit (but the trunk is).They play random snatches of very old music with the show that feels a bit ad hoc.Many people queue up, claiming spaces on the steps and other prime spots well before the show - and once it starts it is a bit of a jostle to get a good view.I was struck by how many people watch the show through their phone - they aren't there experiencing it in person! It is much better in real life, your phone is a poor substitute for the lights.I couldn't help but think they could leverage the structures in place by having them lit up throughout the night."
These big artificial trees with lush greenery growing up the outside and hanging from the 'trees' certainly add to the park
"This is part of gardens by the bay, this is the sky walk that is about 130 meters in length and overpriced for a short elevator ride / walk."
This is part of the gardens by the bay park. You can walk around the super trees without buying a ticket. This area of the city is where a lot of people exercise. We did not stay to see the light show as we were there to see the domes.
"If not for the mesmeriing laser show, late in the evening, the Supertree grove has nothing to boast about on its own. But the laser show makes a visit to this part of the City a must and i shall not miss the show for anything else in Singapore."
"Went to the Supertree Grove for the musical light show on a rainy September evening. The light show was quite average. Couldn't do the OCBS skyway coz it was closed due to the weather.At closing time, we had to wait for almost 1 hour at the taxi rank to get a cab to our hotel. There were loads of people and most of the cabs were the big MPV types and the drivers were trying to convince people that their fare was the same as that of regular taxis. Most people did not want to to take the chance, but the drivers refused to move on so the queue just got longer and longer. Do bring along an umbrella when you visit"
"As compared to marina bay sands view, this is ok. If you tried marina bay sands view from 56th floor. No need to go OCBC. If you have enough leisure time, just try or else we can skip this.Even they won't allow us to stay longer time in the middle of skyway"
Mediocre place. Neutral thoughts to this. It is very hot in the day though. Go at night. Food is overpriced
"** It is one way only - so take your time. **I have issues up high and about 1/3 of the way across my legs turned to jelly so we moved across here quite quickly - my fault trying to get to the other side. Got to other side and once I was okay, went to move back onto walkway to take pictures only to be told no. No signage saying one way only. Very disappointing!!!!!Family missed out on some great photos due to me, so waste of money for us.** Remember, once up on the walkway, it is one way only - don't go to other end until you are ready to leave as you won't be able to go back on the walkway, even to take pictures **"
Nice park to have a walk in the afternoon. The Xmas Wonderland and light show was a disappointment. They charge you SDG10 for the privilege to be able to be inside a park that is supposed to be free access.
"Daily show of Musical Lighting are held two times in a day around evening time.Yet you still can enjoy the garden in daylight. quite pretty.If you have another 8 SGD, you can also buy a ticket and go up to OCBC Sky Way, which is connecting couple super trees."
The lighting shownis in the evening at 7:30pm. Show was fairly nice. With music that will put you on groove. You can dance while admiring the lightings. No need an entry ticket to watch it. Been there before during the day. Nice to go for a stroll. If only there are giant mist fans around the area as it was a hot humid weather.
When you walk out from marina bay sands hotel around 10 mins . You will reach the amzing garden. They had a music show with light effects.
You can walk up to and around the trees for free. Sg$8 to walk on the raised walkway. Free wifi around the trees.Light and music show twice a day in the evening. Around 7.45 and 8.45.Lots pretty at night when alluminated.
"You access this via an elevator, and then walk across to the other side, it is good to note that in some areas the path is wide enough for several people to walk side by side, but in other areas it is single file only."
"Ok to visit, nice plants and a great view of the Sands hotel and garden, but avoid during 11am and 2pm to hot."
Something unique here. Great day out. With lots of neautiful sights and garden displays. The skywalk is a must
"A great way to relax with a snack while waiting for the show to start. Prop on a small mat to enjoy fully. The themes for the music change with the time of the year. Recently, it was National Day songs.Sinages around the park could be improved otherwise end up at the trees near MC Donalds by mistake that do not do the show."
"We hit this at the 1st 'show' & were not early to get a seat on a park bench or even a curb so had to stand for the whole show, which is only 15 minutes but after a long day of walking it was not worth the aching feet. We also did not have the best spot for standing & did not get the full effect of the lights. The music is a tad too loud for my ears as well."
"Worth seeing, but, not essential to enter. Most of the appeal can be seen at a distance. That said, going up to the top is pleasant."
Most of the things to see and do in Singapore is located around the Marina of Singapore. We took an uber from the Merlion to get to supertree grove so not sure how to get there with MRT or bus.The admission to the supertrees are free. But you need a ticket to go to the walkway. We are allowed to in the walkway only for about 45 mins. There are 2 free laser shows every night at 7:45 and 8:45. We viewed the laser show from the ground.Getting out after the laser show takes some time as every one is trying to get out at the same time. There are taxi stands outside as soon as you get out.Please note that the walkway will close if there is bad weather. Even if it is not raining but overcast they will close. Not a bad idea to find out whether they are open before going if it is about to rain.
"Singapore is not offering too many attraction for visitors IMO. Supertrees are nice idea, but frankly, when seeing pics from time to time before visit I expected, that this structures are maybe twice higher, that they are in reality."
Artificial Trees made of metal and other building materials Day visit could be humid and not enjoyable Go in the night to enjoy the lights and night show
"During day time nothing really impressive; however, at night it is totally different. It is worth visiting at night during the light show. Beautiful!"
The groove is an artificial big trees made out of metal and otherbuilding materials. Plants were let to grow around it. The structure performs basic tree function of solar energy production and oxygen production. Its a state of scientific art that can't be appreciated by tourists except maybe for the light works it has by night.
"Garden rhapsody is to be done as a part of cloud forest ,gardens by the bay ,marina shoppes, marina bay walk ,all of the above can be easily completed if one starts before 4 pmGarden rhapsody light and music show as a part of the above is good but on its own is not exceptionalThe lightning and music arrangement though good is not exactly spectacularThe display of lights after the 1st few minutes tends to get repetitiveFinish cloud forest and garden by the bay before the garden rhapsody and then follow it up by a visit to marina shoppesKids usually loose their patience after visiting gardens by the bay and cloud forest so moonlight show is the last nail in the coffin ,so shoppes is a a welcome break ..Overall a pleasant though not a spectacular experience.."
I expect the views at night as the park is lit up is more impressive than the view in daylight. I was expecting much more to be honest as the photos I have seen of the park are beautiful but most were taken at dusk or evening. Nice to see and walk through wonderful gardens however.
"The Supertree Grove is a set of artificial ""trees"" located in (and included in the admission to) Singapore's Gardens by the Bay. Every evening there are two light and sound shows where the structures light up in colors changing to the music. It's a cool concept, but after a few minutes it was just more of the same. Fireworks are a lot more interesting."
"These are certainly a unique feature, but possibly better experienced from a distance or at night during the light shows. Skywalk nice, but not really high enough to see particularly far and a bit uncomfortable given the skywalk moves. A nice food court with sit down dining nearby, however."
"This place is at its best in the evening. Ok light show, but what I liked most, was a great photo exhibition with pictures from the northern parts of europe, asia and canada."
"The Supergrove has a whimsical feel to it, fitting for Singapore. During the day, it's simply too hot though. Either go early in the morning or around dusk."
Not sure of the fuss is about.Yes they light up to music twice a night to music and it is free.Apart from that I don't get it
"I was there during the day, it is quite impressive but nothing special. Singapore weather is hot and humid, and I did not enjoy it."
"The supertrees are impressive looking, more so from a distance, I feel. I thought the sound and light show was a bit lame, but I may have been too close by being under the trees with the Christmas-style lights. Only three of the trees that I saw had these type of lights. The other trees seemed to be lit up with coloured flood lights."
"We stopped by here after a meal and had a nice time watching the trees change colors etc with the music in the background. It was fun and entertaining but, just another tourist attraction. I do recommend it but, don't put your hopes up too high."
"They have built huge concrete ""trees"" and hung them with living plants.The evening light show did not impress me either, but most people there seemed to enjoy it."
"Definitely, the main attraction is going up on the suspended bridge which offers a great view over the Gardens by the Bay, Marina, and Financial District."
"Went there while they had like a Christmas special and there was a ticket required to visit the place. My friends who live in SG said there's usually no tickets in going there. My friends paid for my ticket and when we went to watch the light show it was underwhelming for us. Even my friends said that it wasn't as spectacular compared to their usual light show considering that we paid tickets for this one. However there we're other sights to see in the area, they had like a winter wonderland theme so it was cute. But the light show itself which can be considered as the highlight of the place wasn't really that great at that time."
"OK, so its a good idea to create interest in climbing plants and rainforest trees, with the added opportunity of view from the tree top height downwards. But yet again, we found ourselves asking was the, admittedly quite remarkable, engineering really enhancing our understanding of plant life, or was it merely just a bit of a gimmick?There are some outstanding views from the 25 foot high platforms, right across to the docks, and the river.To our eyes, the Supertree Grove is little more than a bit of pointless good fun made possible by a lot of investment and creating a market for it."
"What you see in the pictures is what is there. You pay (what I believe to be) a large amount to go up an elevator and walk along a catwalk - and you've only got a limited time as there is a maximum number of people allowed up there.That said, the free night show was fantastic. Aimed towards children with its bright colours and animations, it still easily drew a thousand strong crowd of all ages. I would recommend this part."
"Worth seeing it during the day and at night, attending one of the two shows held daily. Shows consist of music playing and trees lighted up at the rhythm of famous tunes, but certainly not spectacular in comparison with available technology nowadays, including lasers, projections and fireworks shows. If you want to try the walkway, get your tickets early in the day, as they are sold out very early. The walkay closes at 09:00 PM, very early for a tourist attraction in Singapore, and this leaves lots of tourists stranded on the ground."
We saw the super tree grove from a distance when we went there for the light and sound show in the evening. If you go during the day time there is nothing too spectacular - at least not worth paying the entry fee. One can instead take a walk around the park and see the beautiful flowers and other species of fauna. It is located right opposite the Marina Bay Sands hotel.
"Average , not good to see.... nothing have there actually Cash weste item in singapore, entry fee 10 doller, on the tree top 8 doller again u need to pay..."
this place is also close to the garden by the bay and looks amazing in the evening and looks great with lighting. The light makes the location even more amazing.
"Nice views from teh top, but the visit wont last long. In 15 minutes you will have seen everything from the walkway."
"These are a really neat idea nestled into the Gardens. We didn't do the walkway, but you could see these all over the Garden"
"Stayed overnight on a cruise ship in the area, and took in the night light show (was synchronised to various X'mas carols and the various X'mas stalls were just starting to open).Went back the next morning to explore the Gardens by the Bay which included a walk through the Supertree Grove (free) & also the elevated walking path (fee applies) through the Supertree Grove.A great park, good at night & day, Easily accessed including by the MTR or from the Marina Bay Sands complex."
"A very interesting sculptured forest, with a restaurant at the top (expensive and just ok), but unless you're doing photography (best to go late in the evening for that) it's visible from the cloud forest (inside, where it's not hot :)"
"kindly book the sky ride tickets early , bcoz due to bad weather it is closed any time, specially at night it looks better"
"I am not a big fan for this, but worth to pass by and take a photo as it is quite close to the Garden by the bay.The light show is better in the evening."
I guess we were spoilt as we were staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and our room looked down on this so we didn't benefit from the height of the supergrove walk. Having been to the Orchid Garden and Cloud Forest I thought the walk was expensive for what it was - you are only given 15 minutes but the views looking down on the garden are pleasant enough. The night time light show at 7.45 and 8.45 is good but overshadowed by the light show on the other side of the hotel in the marina at 8 and 9pm.
"Something to see and instagram... but grows tedious after not that long, maybe because they aren't real trees. :)"
"Although you were only entitled to stay up there for 15 minutes, the time was adequate and the sun was baking hot"
This attraction is too artificial IMHO.I spent too much time getting from one thing to another and then there were queues..
Huge bunch of electric trees that look alike the Avatar movie. Another light and aound show in the center of Singapore. Easy access.
"this is part of the gardens by the bay, however one needs to pay money to take a walk up the supertree grove, which is not really worth the money"
The skywalk was closed because of a chance of rain and this situation lasted for hours. It didn't rain but we gave up after we'd seen everything else. It was unusual but not beautiful. It's supposed to be better at night with a light show and music. We're not going back.
I had been to Gardens by the Bay on a previous trip to Singapore but the Super Tree Grove was closed for maintenance. I have to say I was a little disappointed and underwhelmed once I got on the walkway. There are a couple of good views and photo opportunities but overall I was expecting more. Nice breeze being high up which was nice!
"If you are scared of heights, then this is avoidable as there is a walkway connected with cables and seems to move around in the wind as well. Spectacular sight at night."
"Nothing magic about that one,you can use 15 min of your time(duration of the display)if more you will be bored"
Visited in the evening and the light show has already started by that time. There was a waiting time of 30 minutes to go to the sky walk therefore we didn't go to that. Spent some time sitting under a super tree and it was peaceful. Good place to sit and watch the city and the night sky which is lighted by the trees.There are many restaurants near by so you can have dinner or just a bite under the trees.
"Yep - sure BBC Click said there was free superfast wifi here - but no! The trees were cool, and the skywalk was good - but time limited so so limited, and there's a charge for the sky walk, The evening is beautiful lights and music, not much room, but free pretty lights.... A food court exits to the trees."
"The pictures make it much prettier than what it really looks like. The lights are quite dim in real life. The night show is also boring, just flashy lights. I'm not a big fan of this."
"The Supertrees are an interesting concept and are surrounded by all sorts of native flora. The are good dining options though nothing exceptional. The evening light show was mildly interesting though not worth sticking around for just for the sake of doing so. The best part is the bar at the top of the largest tree, which cost 20SGD for entry but included a beverage. The beverage selection was weak, so go for a drink, enjoy the view, and then move on."
"If you are just target for the supertrees and are not interested in plants, then no need to buy tickets for the flower dome and cloud forest. The park is open to public for free. You can enjoy the outer part of the park and the supertrees. The light show is not attractive when compared to the laser show in Marina Bay."
"This is supposed to be a ""must see"" in Singapore which I don't totally agree on. It's alright, pretty cool but really nothing special if you ask me, so if you have other opportunities don't choose this over something else!"
"We were there for the 5th anniversary, there was a special show with dancers and an Acrobatic turn, with special lighting effects, there was also a display of drones. It was as expected very packed and views of the stage were obstructed. Admission to the elevated walkway around the trees was closed because of the occasion, this was rather disappointing as was the show, the best bit was the synchronised drones at the end. Getting out of the place was a nightmare, pathways had been blocked by barriers and it was utter chaos trying to get a taxi, the system is shambolic with people queue jumping and useless officials trying and making a complete hash of controlling the traffic and taxis. We stood for an hour before managing to get a cab."
"Wanted to get a place at the rooftop bar but it was fully packed. Seat is first come first serve, so do with the restaurant. Magnificent view, place is classy but good wise is Mediocre imo .. but the view compensate it. u can have a chill n drink at the walkway outside the restaurant after dinning .."
"Light show is fine but free at 19:45,20:45 pmLast about 15 minutes easy walk from mrtHave walkway on the top cost lower than 10$"
"While these are impressive looking structures from a distance, there isn't much more to them up close. They reside in a lovely garden area and there is a canopy walk (though I didn't go so can't rate). At night they have a light show that is pretty average. The park and Cloud Dome are the better attractions here."
The attraction looks nice enough with lights and other items and park with a nice view of flyer. but the light show was cancelled due to bad whether so didn't see the actions
"Don't go here if you love trees the way they are, go if you feel you can find value in observing the way birds and animals use these trees. Nice, but no real tree :("
"Being the signature picture in all Garden By the Bay promotions, one goes with high expectations. what one ends up seeing are giant artificial ""trees"" that may very well be skeletons of community overhead water tanks. Frankly, they are ugliest things in Garden By the BAy"
"this is very small area in the garden.the view from top is nothing special.famous location for some movies, but you can skip this.this is or ppl with spare time and money."
"Can be seen from afar - the best view - to access the sky walk you have to go up one tree and down another. We just wanted to go up then down (to see the view) - NOT allowed! If you suffer from vertigo, this is not the trip for you."
Ok so yes they are very impressive and the way they represent the future is great but... no birds really live there and I suspect it is to do with the light show. I just thought it would be more environmentally friendly and would have more nature but the trees themselves are beautiful so still go and see
It is best to visit the area by night. Make sure that you are on the area before the schedule musical. Place is become crowded during this time. Stampede on the stair is possible. Hope a guard will monitor the movement of people.
The real reason one sees this place is because it is on the way to the Domes. The vertical gardens and the ecosystem created are nice but they are by far not the attraction one is paying for. No need to pay for the OCBC walkway.
"Great view. Food is not worth of price charged, definetely. Hous wine is expensive and mediocre. Do not recommend"
Nice but lots of upgrading occurring currently. We walked around for 15 mins and was done. More a night time thing due to the lights but it's busy. Brutal in the heat of the day.
"The best time to visit is the evening before 7 pm when the show starting. The music was mostly Asian, the lights are very nice and creative. The best spot is on the top of the central tree where is the bar as well. Most people are waiting there so be there in time. The place is full of people and bit busy. There are many restaurants around, mostly fast-foods."
"During the day not really impressive, but light and sounds show in evening makes it a nice place to visit. And you can eat easily next to the trees."
"Yes, it's aesthetically pleasing, but no particular wow factor. I think the rest of the gardens are better. Drinks here were rather overpriced, but it isn't impossible to find more affordable options."
"Supertree grove is a bunch of artificial trees created using iron. They are good to see once. However, there is a skywalk between 2 supertree grove. cost is around 8 dollars. One may opt to go there but not worth it."
"If you have some free time while for waiting for a cruise ship, these gardens and bay are a great place to walk or jog around. They were nice, but definitely NOT a ""must see"" location or attraction."
"The concept is cool and the trees are quite impressive. But the view from the walkway (which you have to pay to access) really isn't that much better than many other free views around. While it is cool to be walking around up there, not sure it is worth the price."
I was a bit disappointed as there were just the occasional green lights on the trees. Very pretty but it was a trudge at the end of a long day walking.
We didn't go on the upper walking area because it was paid. We had already paid to go to the top of Marina Sands. How special could it really have been? It's cool but I like real nature. They light them up at night and do a light show. It's definitely worth seeing but just to say you seen it.
"Supertress are okay, but do not miss to go to the two domes - Garden by the Bay a nice for a walkaround, but the highlights are the domes!"
They made look like a big tree as you can see from high and good view. It's only 8 dollars to go up there
"Compared to the Cloud dome, the supertree grove in the gardens by the bay is an average attraction. A tip is to be here in the evening when they have a light and sound show."
Interesting concept and good views. However rather pricey for a ride in an elevator. Views from Marina Bay Sands is better.
Good view from the top and skyway. However view from Marina Bay Sands Skypark killed it. The view from there is much much better compared to here.
went in the night to see the Christmas lights and could not get in .the area was being run by a different company that only sold tickets on line .very upset we not able to buy and print tickets when we got there.
"Just had a view from base. As its a long walk thru the maze like structure. Good view at night. If I had a walker, maybe would take my kid."
We stayed for the lightshow and it was nice but not spectacular or anything. For such mammoth trees I expected a bit more excitement.
"It is a quick elevator trip and then a nice walk (couple of hundred meter) in the ""tree tops"". But its quite expensive for what you get."
"We waited ages for the light show to start and we were disappointed with it so much so that we left before it ended, I can think of many better things to do than visit this."
"From far away, this place serves as a good background for your photo-taking pleasure. However, once you get close to it, it kind of feel empty and nothing much to do. There are not many shades around as well, so be prepared to be exhausted from the heat."
"The Super tree groove is an average kind of place The show that happens in the evening is ok . it lasts for about 15-20 mins . It is not bad , decent for kids but not something that created the Wow factor"
Great attraction to be for all age groups. Visit the dorms and the restaurants close by. Try Indochine or Pollen.
I felt the area was too crowded and not much to do. The overall look is cool especially from the distance.Did not try the the bridge as the line was extremely long.
"These fake trees are fascinating and in many ways symbolic of Singapore's carefully crafted vision of itself as a modern 'garden' city. During the day the 'supertrees' don't provide much shade or anything really of interest unless you pay to go up to the walk way, in which case you have something of a view.At night there are regular light and sound shows which are suprisingly good. The show isn't excessively long and the lights and music coordinate very well, making it much better than some other 'laser and light' shows in Singapore.I wouldn't make a special trip to go to Supertree Grove but if you are in Gardens by the Bay, particularly in the evening (around 8pm I think is the first 'show') then it's worth a visit."
"It's a Green park but hot temperatures because it's tropical outdoor park. You should bring a hat to protect your hair and head.For children visitor, you should have an umbrella I think."
"The supertree grove is very impressive arrangement of man made tree structures with actual greenery growing on the exterior. It forms part of the gardens by the bay attraction. It is free to visit and look at, however there is a charge if you want to walk through the canopy of the grove via a raised walkway.Having done the latter, I would advise that you just do the free walk and save your money for the cloud forest, a far more enjoyable and enriching experience. The paid walkway is very short and the views are more impressive from marina bay sands or the Singapore flyer."
"The gardens are done really nicely, with a huge diversity of flora, which is pretty amazing considering the last time I was in Singapore, in 2005, it was just a bare construction site! The super-trees are big and impressive, but I preferred the natural vegetation more.At night, the super-trees light up in sync with a ""rhapsody"" of oldies-but-goodies pop hits.I thought it was just ok, but the gardens are worth a return trip. Both the gardens and the super-tree light/music show are free and it's fun to spend an afternoon and evening here."
The supertree grove and the night show are a tad overhyped and we found rest of the Gardens far more interesting. Would skip this the next time round.
"In fact,i didn't really enjoy the time i spent there,there's too many people and it is noisy and crowed. When the firework starts,i see nothings but people's head(maybe i am too short:(Hope that i can have a enjoyable experience next time i come!"
"Was not impressed with this site, it is a must to see but would not bother with the evening light show - just a load of flashing lights no apparent choreography."
"Sorry, I really do not understand the fuss about the place.We came here on our first evening in Singapore to enjoy the light show, it was the last day of national holiday, so the show was supposed to be ""extra special"". Well: it was light changing colors in some man made structures. We lasted about 5 minutes, then started to make our way to Marina Bay Sands for the ""Sound, water and light show"" which we enjoyed so much, we stayed for the next show as well.Our night experience of the gardens by the bay, put us of so much, we did not even want to come back to see the trees and domes at day."
"Nothing extraordinary. Visit is free so go at least once but not worthy of a return visit. While there during the light show, stay in the elevated area surrounding the grove, not under the trees so you do not have to crank your head up all the time to watch the show."
"The place itself is worth visiting. I suggest taking a picture at the top. But I can not say anything good about organizational issues. Six times I took a taxi and went there, and it only succeeded on the sixth time. Due to rain, this object was closed all the time."
"Of course the view is incredible but service, cliningness and atmosphere should be reconsidered if they want to keep the prices the feature!"
The place was decorated for Christmas but it did look headachy and not very Christmassy. A stunning sight to see though!
"Heavens, how many times do I have to write 'strictly ok'. Nothing much, just a big tower with creepers around it. Some light and sound show that is again strictly okay and nothing much to write home about. Go there if you are looking to strike off one off the to-do list from the Singapore travel list."
This place is located at Garden by the bays. The nearest MRT to this place is Bay front MRT ( yellow line ) I have been to this place twice already.The light show was stunning and nice during the first visit ( May 2017 ) . But the second visit ( July 2017 ) wasn't that nice as compare to the first visit. As the light show only last for awhile and the story shown on the super trees was no clear enough in term of viewing. There were also very few sound effect during the second lightning show as well.You can also get a very beautiful view of the sunset during the evening. This place is more suitable for people who enjoys strolling and natural lovers.
"I don't understand why are people so amazed by this place. The light show that they have after sunset is just disappointing... simple projection of flower photos, without much structure or artistic direction."
"There was a lot of anticipation for the light show that happens twice every night. We were at the later session. When it finally came on it was surprisingly lame. Not nearly as good as many light shows I have seen around the world. The trees are built on a grand scale and a bit weird; certainly different. Maybe it was the angle I was on, but there was no 'wow' factor."
"The Supertrees themselves are certainly impressive structures, but you get a good look at them when you visit Gardens By the Bay, so leave it at that. We made the mistake of going back for the 8:45 p.m. 'light show', which was a massive disappointment. For barely 15 minutes, a light is projected on to the trunks of the Supertrees, making colours appear but not in a particularly interesting way. For some reason we assumed the skeletal 'branches' of the Supertrees would light up or there would be laser beams or something, but it's all very dull. What's worse, the venue was very crowded with thousands of other punters, many of whom (like us) cried out in dismay when the 'show' ended (i.e. as if to say 'is that all?'). Then, when you fight you way back down to Bayfront MRT station, you will be forced to queue for MRT tickets unless you have a prepaid pass. It really isn't worth it. The only good thing is that you don't have to pay for the show."
"That was the time I spent here.It was nothing spectacular and I didn't bother to wait for the light show. I don't expect it to be spectacular anyway.After seeing real rainforest giants, this steel and concrete structure was a waste of time.I understand it's function and the cosmetic appearance but really, one could learn the same if an exhibit was at a science centre, for instance."
Don't go here expecting any great revelations on environmental science or any real futurist view of the world.
"The Grove constructions look great from outside, but climbing is expensive for what you really get, and the views do not compare with the ones from the Marina Bay terrace or from the Wheel."
"We went a few days ago and although mildly interesting it was over priced, brief, very crowded and basically just creepers growing up lattices of scaffolding!"
"We love nature, we love places like kew gdns hot houses. This is terrificly expensive and we certainly abjor imitation of nature. Why not raise a real forest instead of this cold futeristic nightmare."
It's much hyped. Nothing much except some photo opportunities. Don't go on a sunny humid day. Best time to be there is evenings.
Probably the most photographed site in Singapore these days. But when you are there it's mostly concrete paths and steel constructions. Of course no way you would be allowed to step on the grass. So nothing of the ease and relaxation of a true park.
"Impressive when walking through the Gardens but a comparatively expensive disappointment if walking the walk. A real let down to the whole park, Would not venture on these ""boards"" again."
"Why to have normal trees when you can have opulent, expensive and distasteful artificial ones right? The whole Singapore is one big display of wealth, which of course can not hide its sterility and absence of spirit. Also if you want to see how the how totalitarian regimes are starting, visit Singapore."
"Disappointing and objectionable to even have a show in the evening, concept is great of the Grove but thats about all. Mis informed by the ticketing kiosk to the wrong location of the show after waiting in another area for over an hour. Bad experience."
i did not go up for the simple reason and I think it is wrong that you are required to pay to enter some christmas display. also they wont sell you the ticket for the christmas display at main counter. seems a bit convoluted forcing people to pay for something they dont want. I chose not to go for that reason. they are neat to look at from below and at night they come alive with light which make them that more interesting. i suspect you would get good views of the area from them.
"Quite boring during the day, and starting to look old. It looks pretty with the lights on at night from a distance. Paying to go on top of the tree (the restaurant and bar) is definitely not worth it, because the trees are built in a depression, it's not impressive. The bar at the top is derelict and not in use. Better spend money to good to the sands hotel..."
This is a must for everyone who go yo singapore especially at night it's just spectacular. THE government doing so much for the development of the country .A big congratulation.
